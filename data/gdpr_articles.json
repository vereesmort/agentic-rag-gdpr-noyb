measures based on Article 6(1) shall be carried out only under the control of official authority or when the processing is authorised by Union or Member State law providing for appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Any comprehensive register of criminal convictions shall be kept only under the control of official authority. Article 10 GDPR is a complementary provision to the Law Enforcement Directive (LED) [ 1 ] . It aims to ensure that criminal data processing is still carried out in accordance with the GDPR\u2019s principles and with appropriate safeguards when the LED is not directly applicable. Article 2(2)(d) GDPR excludes any processing that falls under the scope of the LED from the scope of the GDPR. Article 10 GDPR is intended to extend the protection of the GDPR to the processing of certain criminal data that is not included in the scope of the LED. Specifically, this includes data that has the potential to lead to stigmatisation, which may lead to profound effects on different aspects of a data subjects' life due to its sensitive nature. For example, when data is inappropriately processed in the employment context. [ 2 ] This position was affirmed by the Court of Justice in Case C\u2011439/19, Latvijas Republikas Saeima . In this judgment, the Court noted that data processed under Article 10 GDPR warrants a higher standards of protection for processing and grant of access, as the data which falls under its scope has the potential to expose the data subject to stigmatisation and social disapproval. At paragraphs 74 and 75, the Court observed that the risk of stigmatisation in itself amounts to severe interference in the data subject's private and professional life for the purposes of Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter, consequently justifying stricter thresholds for processing. [ 3 ] \"Article 10 of the GDPR is intended to ensure enhanced protection as regards processing which, because of the particular sensitivity of the data at issue, is liable to constitute a particularly serious interference with the fundamental rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data, guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter [...]. Since the data to which Article 10 of the GDPR refers relates to behaviour that gives rise to social disapproval, the grant of access to such data is liable to stigmatise the data subject and thereby to constitute a serious interference with his or her private or professional life. [...] Under the principle of proportionality, limitations may be made only if they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the European Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others. They must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary and the legislation which entails the interference must lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of the measure in question [...].\" CJEU - C-439/19 - Latvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points) , margin number 74 et seq, 105. Article 10 GDPR allows for the processing of data relating to criminal convictions and offences. The term \u201cconvictions\u201d makes reference to pronouncements of criminal penalties on perpetrators, instigators or assistants. Actors such as victims or witnesses are not included. However, there is discussion about whether suspects should be included. [ 4 ] The notion of \u201coffence\" must be interpreted according to Member State law. In addition, the CJEU has established three criteria that must be examined when determining what constitutes a criminal proceeding: the legal classification of the offence under national law, the nature of the offence and the nature as well as degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned is liable to incur. [ 5 ] Therefore, the enhanced protection provided for by Article 10 GDPR is generally limited to the criminal field alone and not to mere administrative offences not covered by criminal provisions. [ 6 ] The processing of data relating to criminal convictions and offences must be carried out either under the control of official authority or when the processing is authorised by Union or Member State law. However, any processing still needs to rely on a legal basis under Article 6(1) GDPR and comply with the principles enshrined in Article 5 GDPR . Additionally, the processing will still be subject to other GDPR provisions that may be applicable, such as the obligation to carry out a data protection impact assessment from Article 35 GDPR or the obligation to designate a data protection officer from Article 37 GDPR . [ 7 ] The processing shall only be carried out by public authorities and private entities that are entitled to do so under Member State law. In this regard, interpreting the norm sensu contrario, the public authorities are those not in the scope of Article 3(7) LED. Processing by private entities shall happen under direct control of authorised entities; the authorised entity shall be fully or largely responsible for the processing. Mere supervision that does not, in practice, allow for the reliable control of the conditions of individual processing is not enough. [ 8 ] Alternatively, the processing can be authorised by Union or Member state law. Such law allowing private entities to process data relating to criminal convictions and offences must provide for appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Specifically, the legitimate purpose(s) and and necessary requirements should be stipulated together with the applicable safeguards in such a provision. [ 9 ] The last sentence of Article 10 GDPR states that any comprehensive register of criminal convictions must be kept only under the control of official authority. This provision further narrows the possibilities to process information about criminal convictions. A register can be considered comprehensive if it contains information concerning numerous data subjects. It is not necessary that such a register contains the information about all criminal convictions in the respective Member State. [ 10 ] This provision excludes the possibility of private criminal databases.

Obligation to Inform 3.2.1 Burden of Proof 3.2.2 Obligation to Inform 4 Decisions 5 References 1. If the purposes for which a controller processes personal data do not or do no longer require the identification of a data subject by the controller, the controller shall not be obliged to maintain, acquire or process additional information in order to identify the data subject for the sole purpose of complying with this Regulation. 2. Where, in cases referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the controller is able to demonstrate that it is not in a position to identify the data subject, the controller shall inform the data subject accordingly, if possible. In such cases, Articles 15 to 20 shall not apply except where the data subject, for the purpose of exercising his or her rights under those articles, provides additional information enabling his or her identification. The data minimisation principle in Article 5(1)(c) GDPR limits controllers in their processing operations, as it specifically requires them to only process data which is necessary for the fulfilment of specific purposes. During the legislative process there were worries, that the GDPR could be interpreted to require processing more personal data, just to comply with certain requirements and rights of the data subjects - which would be counterproductive. Article 11 GDPR is meant to address this matter. Under Article 11(1) GDPR, when a processing operation does not or no longer requires the identification of the data subject, then the controller should act accordingly, deleting or otherwise hiding the identifying reference to the data subject. When this happens, the controller is not obliged to process additional information about the data subject for the sole purpose of GDPR compliance. Article 11(2) GDPR provides for an important exception to the above-mentioned rule. If a data subject wants to exercise their GDPR rights and to that extent provides further information allowing their (re)identification, the controller shall consider that information and, if possible, address the request. Article 11 GDPR only address the use of personal data. There are many other duties under the GDPR which regularly require the keeping of records, proof or evidence. They are not affected by Article 11 GDPR. Article 11 GDPR applies when \u201c personal data do not or do no longer require the identification of a data subject \u201d. One could think that this refers to an anonymisation scenario, but this conclusion would make little sense. First, the GDPR does not apply to anonymous data. Second, under Article 11(2) GDPR, it would be impossible to inform a data subject who is not identifiable. [ 1 ] Under Article 4(1) GDPR, personal data means any information relating to an \u201c identified \u201d or \u201c identifiable\u201d natural person . Looking attentively at the wording of Article 11(1) GDPR, it is clear that the provision only covers situations in which the data subject is not or no longer \u201c identified \u201d, [ 2 ] but clearly excludes cases where they are still \u201c identifiable \u201d. In other words, the provision applies in case of pseudonymisation which, according to Recital 26, refers to information about an identifiable person. In the case of pseudonymisation, regardless whether it was implemented from the beginning (\u201c does not require \u201d) or at a later stage (\u201c does no longer require \u201d) of the processing operation, the GDPR grants the controller a privilege which reflects the favour towards data minimisation, storage limitation and data security. In particular, the controller shall not be obliged to retain, obtain or process further information about the individual if such information is needed to identify them and comply with one or more part of the GDPR. This privilege is not absolute but refers exclusively to those parts of the GDPR that require the identification of the data subject. [ 3 ] Some examples are possible. Take the case of the Google Street View. This process undoubtedly involves the collection of some personal data of inhabitants and their homes. However, it is argued, Google would probably not be obliged to collect the contact details of individual inhabitants in order to inform them of the processing under Articles 13 or 14 GDPR. This can be drawn from the final sentence of Article 11(1) GDPR. [ 4 ] It must be assessed with the utmost attention whether GDPR provisions require the identification of the data subject, \u00a0and under no circumstances should Article 11(1) GDPR be regarded as a carte blanche for the transgression of data protection regulations. The data minimisation principle limits controllers in their processing operations, as it specifically requires them to only process data which is necessary for the fulfilment of specific purposes. Under Article 11(1) GDPR, when a processing operation does not or no longer requires the identification of the data subject, then the controller should act accordingly, deleting or otherwise hiding the identifying reference to the data subject. When this happens, the controller is not obliged to obtain additional information about the data subject for the sole purpose of GDPR compliance. Article 11(2) GDPR provides for an important exception to the above-mentioned rule. If a data subject wants to exercise their GDPR rights and to that extent provides further information allowing their (re)identification, the controller shall consider that information and, if possible, address the request. [ 5 ] In particular, all other GDPR requirements that do not require the data subject\u2019s identification remain applicable, including, but not limited to, security of processing ( Article 32(1) GDPR ) and the general principles of processing set out in Article 5 GDPR . In confirming the above interpretation, Paragraph 2 sets out a specific framework for the case that a data subject exercises their rights under Articles 15 to 20 GDPR. By definition, this situation requires the identification of the data subject, as a right only exists insofar as it is given to a specific person and they exercise it. In such circumstances, if, after pseudonymisation (\" In cases referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article \"), the controller receives a request to exercise the data subject\u2019s right, but for technical reasons is unable to identify them, the controller must (i) prove this impossibility and (ii) inform the data subject of the reasons which render the request impossible. This will suffice to stay the claim (\" In such cases, Articles 15 to 20 shall not apply \") unless the data subject provides additional information allowing their identification. If their identification is possible following the receipt of the additional information, the exception will not apply and the controller shall comply with the data subject\u2019s request. \"[I]f the data subject can provide the pseudonym or pseudonyms under which data relating to them is stored, and proof that those pseudonyms pertain to them, the controller should be able to identify the data subjects. In consequence, the data subject rights should apply in this case. Therefore, in order to give full effect to the rights of the data subjects, the controller should indicate in the information provided to data subjects according to Art. 11(2) GDPR how they can obtain the pseudonyms relating to them, and how they can be used to demonstrate their identity. In this case, the controller may need to provide the identity and the contact details of the source of the pseudonymised data or of the pseudonymising controller\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 1/2025 on Pseudonymisation\u2019, 16 January 2025 (Version for public consultation), margin number 78 et seq, margin numbers omitted. The controller must be able to demonstrate that identifying the data subject is impossible. This demonstration should provide a transparent explanation of the reasons why the controller is unable to do so. Generic or circular arguments (e.g. \" Our systems are unable to identify your data \") do not meet the requirement of a proper demonstration under the fairness and transparency principle ( Article 5(1)(a) GDPR ). Article 11(2) GDPR provides for a peculiar informative obligation (\" Where [...] the controller is able to demonstrate that it is not in a position to identify the data subject, the controller shall inform the data subject accordingly, if possible \"). Such information is clearly different from that received under Articles 13 or 14 GDPR, and is particularly important as it allows the data subject to evaluate the allegedly non-identifying processing, as well as provide additional information to enable their identification. The controller should therefore provide tailored information and explain why identification is not possible. Furthermore, to comply with the principle of fairness the controller should indicate in advance which data the data subject should provide for their (re)identification.

It can be assumed that in general business transactions only a few use cases under Article 11(1) exist because the business purpose usually requires identification of the business partner, for example to carry out deliveries, to assess creditworthiness or to maintain business correspondence. \u2191 Kampert, in Sydow, Europ\u00e4ische Datenschutzgrundverordnung, Article 11 GDPR, margin number 7 (C.H.

The controller shall take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 and any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and 34 relating to processing to the data subject in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in particular for any information addressed specifically to a child. The information shall be provided in writing, or by other means, including, where appropriate, by electronic means. When requested by the data subject, the information may be provided orally, provided that the identity of the data subject is proven by other means. 2.   The controller shall facilitate the exercise of data subject rights under Articles 15 to 22. In the cases referred to in Article 11(2), the controller shall not refuse to act on the request of the data subject for exercising his or her rights under Articles 15 to 22, unless the controller demonstrates that it is not in a position to identify the data subject. 3.   The controller shall provide information on action taken on a request under Articles 15 to 22 to the data subject without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. That period may be extended by two further months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests. The controller shall inform the data subject of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay. Where the data subject makes the request by electronic form means, the information shall be provided by electronic means where possible, unless otherwise requested by the data subject. 4.   If the controller does not take action on the request of the data subject, the controller shall inform the data subject without delay and at the latest within one month of receipt of the request of the reasons for not taking action and on the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and seeking a judicial remedy. 5.   Information provided under Articles 13 and 14 and any communication and any actions taken under Articles 15 to 22 and 34 shall be provided free of charge. Where requests from a data subject are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, the controller may either: The controller shall bear the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded or excessive character of the request. 6.   Without prejudice to Article 11, where the controller has reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the natural person making the request referred to in Articles 15 to 21, the controller may request the provision of additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject. 7.   The information to be provided to data subjects pursuant to Articles 13 and 14 may be provided in combination with standardised icons in order to give in an easily visible, intelligible and clearly legible manner a meaningful overview of the intended processing. Where the icons are presented electronically they shall be machine-readable. 8.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 92 for the purpose of determining the information to be presented by the icons and the procedures for providing standardised icons. This provision opens Chapter III of the GPDR titled \"Rights of the data subject\". As the name suggest, this chapter provides for rights of data subjects. While some rights have to be exercised by the data subject in order to oblige the controller to take action, some of the rights rights need to be complied with by the controller without a prior request by the data subject, like the initial information under Article 13 and 14 GDPR or the prohibition of automated individual decision-making in Article 22 GDPR. However, with Article 12 GDPR Chapter III starts with general rules regarding transparency and modalities in connection with data subjects rights. Criticism of lengthy, hardly comprehensible privacy policies, confusing online forms and controllers that cannot be easily reached is omnipresent. Article 12 GDPR is meant to take care of these issues and ensure frank and transparent information, as well as the efficient exercise of the data subject\u2019s rights. Transparency and efficient communication is a prerequisite to exercise the rights under the GDPR, but the lack of clear information and efficient response to the exercise of rights is more often than not one of the main stumbling blocks for data subjects in practice. Article 12 GDPR requires similar standards to other EU law, such as the Unfair Terms Directive 93/13/EEC that limits the use of unclear, unfair or disadvantageous contractual terms or the requirement of any service provider to provide an email address to communicate 'rapidly' and 'efficiently' under Article 5(1)(c) eCommerce Directive 2000/31/EC . To ensure that the rights of data subjects are not undermined, Article 12 regulates clarity and accessibility standards regarding communications with the data subject. The provisions of Article 12 largely apply to Articles 13 , 14 , 15 to 22 and 34 GDPR and thereby form horizontal rules, that must always be kept in mind when these Articles are applied. This horizontal application also means that Article 12 GDPR covers situations where the controller must actively provide information (such as under Articles 13 , 14 , or 34 GDPR ) as well as situations where the controller must be able to respond to requests or the exercise of rights by the data subject quickly and efficiently. Not all horizontal rules in Article 12 GDPR have a corresponding material requirement in Articles 13 , 14 , 15 to 22 and 34 GDPR . The horizontal rules do not always fit the named Articles. Therefore, Article 12 GDPR must be read in conjunction with the context and purpose of the relevant Article and only applies where there is a corresponding aim in an Article. [ 1 ] For example: While any information must be \"concise\" it does not mean that a copy of personal data under Article 15(3) GDPR should not be fully provided, but it does mean that a privacy policy under Article 13 GDPR should not be too long. Article 12 GDPR may be limited by Union or national Law in accordance with Article 23 GDPR . EDPB Guidelines: For this Article, see the following Guidelines: WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018 (available here ); and EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.1) (available here ). Article 12(1) GDPR requires controllers to take appropriate measures to provide any information under Articles 13 and 14 GDPR and any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and 34 GDPR in a manner that is concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible, using clear and plain language. The provision further provides for rather vague rules regarding the medium the controller should use when providing information to data subjects; specifically, the information should be provided in writing, or by other means, which can include electronic means or even oral means if this is requested by the data subject and the data subject's identity is authenticated. Therefore, the first part of this provision can be understood as setting out two main requirements. Firstly, the content must be presented in a precise way to provide a clear picture of the information. Secondly, the manner in which the information is presented must be easily understandable to the data subject without requiring excessive cognitive effort or time. [ 2 ] The second part or the provision deals with the form in the sense of the medium that should be used by the controller when communicating with the data subject, establishing more specific rules on when information can be provided to the data subject orally. [ 3 ] This provision covers, on the one hand, the initial information of the data subjects under Article 13 and 14 GDPR. On the other hand, it covers any communication with the data subject under Articles 15 to 22 GDPR (i.e. data subjects rights) and the communication in connection with the notification of a personal data breach in accordance with Article 34 GDPR. Complying with the requirements of Article 12(1) GDPR may be challenging. For example, deciding what is appropriate to satisfy both the preciseness and the clarity requirement in a privacy information will not always be an obvious choice. As a matter of fact, there may even be conflicts between preciseness and clarity of the information, as the former usually pushes in the direction of more complexity, whereas the latter requires a certain degree of simplification. [ 4 ] In certain circumstances, for instance, a given processing may not be easy to explain, especially where a considerable amount of data is processed and numerous actors are involved in the processing chain. The wording of Article 12(1) GDPR allows the controller some leeway to pick an appropriate measure. [ 5 ] This may be simple texts in standard situations and a very elaborate system in complex situations. Drafting information that is short and concise is not easy, especially when it comes to complex data processing. Complying with Article 12(1) GDPR requires substantial effort, skill and innovative thinking. For example: A small business may just have a box with a sign saying \"drop your business card here to get updates via email\" and some additional small print to satisfy Article 12(2) GDPR. A controller of a complex processing system may need to draft a detailed privacy policy, explainer videos for complex issues, multiple layers of information to ensure \"appropriate\" information. Importantly, the complexity of processing is not a justification for reducing the transparency standards. Complex processing operations will usually require more effort to make transparency efforts appropriate in relation to the interference with the rights of a data subject. \"[T]he [controller's] assessment should aim at choosing the most appropriate method for providing all information covered by this right, depending on the specific circumstances in each case. As a consequence, a controller who processes a vast amount of data on a large scale must accept to undertake great efforts to ensure the right of access to the data subjects in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, by using plain and clear language.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.1), margin number 129 regarding transparency measures in connection to the right of access. Article 12 GDPR does not allow to limit the rights of data subjects due to the complexity of a controller's system. If it is not possible to process personal data while also complying with the transparency obligations under Article 12 GDPR, then the system can simply not be used to process personal data legally. Article 12(1) GDPR establishes transparency obligations regarding the information of and communication with data subjects. In particular, the information and communication should be provided to data subjects in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in particular for any information addressed specifically to a child. Information about the processing must be presented concisely . This is intended to prevent controllers from providing an overly lengthy or convoluted description of the processing activity, as data subjects usually will not read multiple pages of the text. Thus, controllers have a positive obligation to prevent data subjects from experiencing information overload. [ 6 ] There are many linguistic approaches to achieve concise information, without loosing content. In the area of privacy policies, the use of layered privacy statements is a common approach to present the most relevant section to the data subject rather than providing them with an unconscionable notice. \"In an online context, the use of a layered privacy statement/ notice will enable a data subject to navigate to the particular section of the privacy statement/ notice which they want to immediately access rather than\nhaving to scroll through large amounts of text searching for particular issues.\" WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018, margin number 8. A layered approach may however not be used to hide the more problematic processing in a lower layer. The most relevant information or any unexpected processing should be easily available. \"This information should be clearly differentiated from other non-privacy related information such as contractual provisions or general terms of use. In an online context, the use of a layered privacy statement/ notice will enable a data subject to navigate to the particular section of the privacy statement/ notice which they want to immediately access rather than having to scroll through large amounts of text searching for particular issues.\" WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018, margin number 8. In the context of Article 12 GDPR, the main goal of transparency is the accurate and fair understanding of the information and communication provided to the data subjects under Articles 13 , 14 , 15 to 22 and 34 GDPR . [ 7 ] This is necessary because, otherwise, it would be impossible for data subjects to fully grasp the processing of their personal data, evaluate the lawfulness of such processing and enjoy the different rights granted by those provisions. [ 8 ] Transparency requires a fair and honest communication of the processing operation. Withholding or hiding information is the antithesis of transparent information. The same is true of deceptive information. For example: A controller uses the term \u201cTo allow you a better experience, we may share some information with our partners\u201d, when in fact the data is sold to a specific data broker for the purpose of advertisement. This would not be a \u201ctransparent\u201d explanation of the intended processing. A data subject may easily exercise their right to erasure against a known recipient, but is not able to exercise his or her rights when only informed about undisclosed \"partners\". In any way, data subjects should be able to determine the scope and consequences of a processing activity; this requirement is therefore closely related to the principle of transparency and fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR . [ 9 ] Information is \u201c intelligible \u201d when it is understandable by a member of the intended audience. In some cases there may be multiple audiences that a controller addresses, including people with disabilities, different language skills or education. Therefore, a data controller must have an understanding of the people that it collects information about, which it should use to determine what they are likely to understand. [ 10 ] For example: A controller dealing with professionals working in a specific area may rely on the fact that they understand the relevant professional terminology. A controller that processes personal data of average consumers would have to avoid any jargon. A controller catering to audiences where a relevant number of data subjects do not speak the local language as the first language may need to use simplified language. In many cases the intelligibility of a text can be objectively tested by asking members of the target audience if they understand the information. There is a growing movement towards simplified writing, which can provide relevant information to ensure understandable texts in each language. Intelligibility is also a relevant factor, when various formats are used, like videos, animations or \"gamified\" information, as such information may not be accessible to all data subjects, such as blind or elderly data subjects. \"The requirement that information is \u201cintelligible\u201d means that it should be understood by an average member of the intended audience. Intelligibility is closely linked to the requirement to use clear and plain language. An accountable data controller will have knowledge about the people it collects information about and it can use this knowledge to determine what that audience would likely understand. For example, a controller collecting the personal data of working professionals can assume its audience has a higher level of understanding than a controller that obtains the personal data of children. If controllers are uncertain about the level of intelligibility and transparency of the information and effectiveness of user interfaces/notices/ policies etc., they can test these, for example, through mechanisms such as user panels, readability testing, formal and informal interactions and dialogue with industry groups, consumer advocacy groups and regulatory bodies, where appropriate, amongst other things\" WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018, margin number 9. The \" easily accessible \" element implies that the data subjects should not have to actively search for the information. It should be readily visible and clear to them where and how they can access the information. This can be achieved through various means, such as providing the information directly to them (e.g. in an attachment), linking to the resources on a website, or providing it as an answer to a natural language question. Examples of how this can be implemented include online layered privacy statement, FAQs, a reference to the information in the welcome message of a hotline, contextual pop-ups that activate when a data subject fills in an online form, or interactive digital interfaces like chat-bots. [ 11 ] \"For apps, the necessary information should also be made available from an online store prior to download. Once the app is installed, the information still needs to be easily accessible from within the app. One way to meet this requirement is to ensure that the information is never more than \u201ctwo taps away\u201d (e.g. by including a \u201cPrivacy\u201d/ \u201cData Protection\u201d option in the menu functionality of the app). Additionally, the privacy information in question should be specific to the particular app and should not merely be the generic privacy policy of the company that owns the app or makes it available to the public.\" WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018, margin number 11. Easy access to information also plays a major role whenever physically impaired people (e.g. blind or hearing-impaired people) are concerned. From this perspective, alongside with more traditional formats, the controller must be able to use alternative means of communication which suit the data subject's specific needs. The requirement for clear and plain language means that information should be provided in a manner as simple as possible, avoiding to downplay or 'reframe' processing operations, as well as complex sentence and language structures. Best practices for clear communication should be followed regardless whether information is written, delivered orally, or by audio/audio-visual methods (including for vision-impaired data subjects). [ 12 ] Text that may be understandable for lawyers, compliance experts or technicians, may not be understandable for average users with limited language skills or limited education. If guidelines exist in a specific language on how to simplify legal language, these guidelines should be considered by the controller. It is common that controller information is drafted in a careful manner in order to avoid taking a clear position. While there are surely reasons for this approach, [ 13 ] the GDPR clearly requires to plainly say which processing is undertaken and what is not done. Cloudy wording that tries to camouflage the processing, or aims at marketing purposes rather than at providing a plain explanation, would violate this provision. The information should be concrete as well as definitive, and should neither be phrased in abstract or ambivalent terms, nor leave room for diverging interpretations. [ 14 ] Common mistake: Common qualifiers such as \u201cmay\u201d, \u201cmight\u201d, \u201csome\u201d, \u201coften\u201d and \u201cpossible\u201d should be avoided. Equally, open-ended lists, usually stating with wording like \u201csuch as\u201d are not clear and plain. Where data controllers opt to use vague language, they should be able to, in accordance with the principle of accountability, demonstrate why the use of such language could not be avoided and how it does not undermine the fairness of processing. [ 15 ] Information that suggests that processing goes further than in reality ( overclaiming ) also constitutes false and thereby unclear information. While such approaches are often used just to be sure that every processing operation is covered, overclaiming leads to a situation where the data subject cannot be sure that the statement is fully accurate. Overclaiming can also lead to inconsistencies between information provided ex-ante under Article 13 and 14 GDPR and information provided ex-post under Article 15 GDPR . Article 12(1) highlights that the above requirements are especially relevant when information is addressed to children. In the larger context, this is just a specific situation where information must be provided in a form that is understandable for the relevant audience. Therefore, if a controller is aware that the targeted audience includes other vulnerable people, this should also be taken into account. [ 16 ] \"Where a data controller is targeting children or is, or should be, aware that their goods/services are particularly utilised by children (including where the controller is relying on the consent of the child), it should ensure that the vocabulary, tone and style of the language used is appropriate to and resonates with children so that the child addressee of the information recognises that the message/ information is being directed at them.\" WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018 margin number 14. Examples of child-centered language can be found in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in Child Friendly Language. [ 17 ] The requirement of \" intelligibility \" (see above) also affects the language used for the communication. Whilst the GDPR does not expressly regulate the use of languages, it is clear that the level of intelligibility of information is directly linked to the user\u2019s capacity of understanding a certain language as a native or non-native speaker. This can be separated into information that must be actively provided by the controller and passive communication initiated by the data subject (such as the exercise of a right). From a factual perspective, controllers that know that a relevant part of their data subjects do not speak the dominant language in a country and also offer products in different languages, may need to provide the relevant information in these languages too. Given that the right to data protection is a fundamental right, the duty to provide intelligible information is neither limited to EU citizens or residents, nor official EU languages. [ 18 ] The situation may also require translation of documents to non-EU languages. The GDPR does not clearly limit the efforts that a controller has to take when it comes to translations, but it must take \" appropriate \" measures to provide the information to everyone. If the data subjects are not known, a minimum would be to provide information in all languages that the service of the controller is offered in or the official languages of all the markets served. [ 19 ] At the same time, it does not seem \" appropriate \" to demand that any possible data subject must get a translation to their mother tongue. For example: A German company mainly employs persons from former Yugoslavia. Most employees only speak a couple of words of German. The employer could provide information under Article 13 GDPR in Serbo-Croatian, if this ensures that all employees understand the notice. For example: A hotel in Venice must not provide a privacy policy in all possible languages of any possible tourist, but it would be \"appropriate\" to provide it in common international languages like English, French or Spanish. It may also be \"appropriate\" to provide the language of the most common visitors, which may be Chinese for an Italian hotel focusing on the Chinese market. Providing information that is \" intelligible \" also means that translations must be accurate and understandable. A mere auto-translation may not be sufficient for a complex privacy policy. \"Where the information is translated into one or more other languages, the data controller should ensure that all the translations are accurate and that the phraseology and syntax makes sense in the second language(s) so that the translated text does not have to be deciphered or re-interpreted. (A translation in one or more other languages should be provided where the controller targets data subjects speaking those languages.)\" WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018, margin number 13. If a data subject exercises his or her rights under Articles 13 , 14 , 15 to 22 and 34 GDPR in another language than used by the controller, the controller must respond in the relevant language if the data subject objectively does not understand the communication or information in the provided language. [ 19 ] The requirement is that the communication must be \" intelligible \" for the data subject. If a data subject merely feels that it would be more convenient to communicate in his or her mother tongue, but understands the language provided by the controller, the information is still \"intelligible\". For unfounded or excessive request, see also Article 12(5) GDPR below. Under Article 12(1) GDPR, information \u201c shall be provided in writing, or by other means, including, where appropriate, by electronic means .\u201d The written form is therefore the default option. However, in addition to the written form, other means can be used, and that includes electronic information, videos, graphics, non-verbal methods and oral information. The most common form of providing relevant information is clearly in writing. In offline context this will usually be printed. There is no duty to provide the information in a format that can be kept by the data subject, it must only be \"provided\". It is also possible to provide information on a sign or similar formats. In addition to the traditional written form, the GDPR allows for providing information in electronic form. The use of the disjunctive phrase \" or \", followed by the expression \" where appropriate \", suggests that the written form may be abandoned in certain circumstances, and that the controller has some discretion in this regard. [ 20 ] In case of online activities, the WP29 suggested the implementation of layered privacy statements which allow website visitors to navigate particular aspects of the relevant privacy statement that are of most interest to them. The use of a layered approach is nonetheless not the only available option. Other electronic means include \u201c just-in-time \u201d contextual pop-up notices in a form or flow, 3D touch or hover-over notices, and privacy dashboards. Non-written electronic means which may be used in addition to a layered privacy statement might also include videos and smartphone or IoT voice alerts. [ 21 ] \u201c Other [not necessarily electronic] means \u201d might include cartoons, info-graphics or flowcharts. [ 22 ] The method chosen by controllers must fit the particular circumstances. For example, if a certain device does not have a screen, controllers can provide a printed privacy statement inside the device package or redirect the data subject to the URL website address or QR code where the privacy notice can be found. [ 23 ] However, such means must be reasonably accessible to data subjects of all ages, ability and technical expertise. In many cases, a combination of multiple means (e.g. a written policy and parallel graphics, videos or in-line information) will be best suited to ensure broad access and the best use of alternative forms of information. Finally, the GDPR also allows data subjects to request information to be provided orally. Controllers \" may \" do so under two conditions: (i) the data subject must request oral information or communication and (ii) the controller must have otherwise verified the data subject\u2019s identity. [ 24 ] The second requirement, only refers to cases where data subject's authentication is necessary. There is no duty by the controller to provide information orally. [ 25 ] For example: A data subject wants to know the results of a medical exam. The staff member at the clinic should verify the identity of the person. The information can then be provided orally. Under Article 12(2) GDPR the controller must facilitate the data subject in the exercise of their GDPR rights under Articles 15 to 22 GDPR . At the same time, Article 12(2) provides for the option to refuse to act on the request of a data subject's right if a controller is unable to identify the data subject and can demonstrate this fact accordingly. Other than Article 12(1) these rules do not apply to the duty to provide information under Article 13 and 14 GDPR or the duty to communicate a data breach under Article 34 GDPR . The term \" facilitate \" codifies a proactive duty by the controller who must take any reasonable action to ease the exercise of GDPR rights under Articles 15 to 22 GDPR . [ 26 ] The GDPR does not define the notion of \u201c facilitation \u201d, but mentions that modalities should be provided; e.g. Recital 59 GDPR expresses the need to implement modalities to facilitate the exercise of the data subjects' rights, including mechanisms to request and obtain access to and rectification or erasure of personal data and the exercise of the right to object. These modalities should cover the whole range of activities a controller undertakes to fully address a GDPR right request. In particular, controllers must demonstrate that they handle data subjects' requests in a way that facilitates their rights. [ 27 ] \"[T]he controller should always be able to demonstrate, that the way to handle the request aims to give the broadest effect to the right of access and that it is in line with its obligation to facilitate the exercise of data subjects' rights (Art. 12(2) GDPR).\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.1), margin number 35. In particular, a controller is not allowed to implement unnecessary burdens in the process of exercising data subjects' rights. [ 28 ] Data subjects should be able to reach the controller in an easy way (e.g. a postal address, a dedicated telephone number, and/or a dedicated e-mail address). [ 29 ] This duty is very similar to the existing requirement of any service provider to provide an email address that allows to communicate \" rapidly \" and \" efficiently \" under Article 5(1)(c) eCommerce Directive 2000/31/EC . It is important to stress the fact that the data subject can choose the format in which it wants to send any request to the controller, as long as it is a common format (such as emails, postal letters, phone calls, PDFs and alike) and it is not sent to a clearly irrelevant contact point. [ 30 ] Controllers may not limit communication to certain formats or forms, unless this is factually required. Controllers that embrace this duty see the exercise of rights as a feature of their product or service. Controllers may use existing capacities and knowledge in the area user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design to \" facilitate \" data subjects to exercise their rights as seamlessly as placing an order. Common approaches include a dedicated email address for GDPR requests, online forms or in-line options to delete, correct or download information for the data subject. While there is an overlap with other business functions (like self-service portals to update personal details in a profile) it is crucial that these tools fully implement the rights of data subjects, or that limitations are clearly communicated, if they are marketed as a GDPR tool. For example: A controller implements a \"privacy tool\" for users to edit and delete certain information or get a copy of their data - this facilitates the exercise of rights. However, if data subjects are forced to use this tool and the controller does not allow to exercise their rights by other means, this does not facilitate the exercise of rights for data subjects that are unable to use these tools. Furthermore, if the \"privacy tool\" does not provide a full copy of all data under Article 15(3) and lacks information under Article 15(1) , it may actually be deceptive to refer data subjects to this tool when they seek to exercise their rights under Article 15 GDPR . It may however be fair to refer to the \"privacy tool\" to change a wrong name or address, if this can be done there and this is the sole request by the data subject. Once the request is received, the controller should be able to handle it internally as efficiently as possible, and ensure the request is handled by the appropriate department. Any subsequent interaction with the data subject must once again be marked by the principle of fairness and must not result in delay tactics, rephrasing of the request and alike. At the same time, the facilitation of the exercise of rights may include asking back about the exact wishes of the data subject or requesting more information to fully comply with the request, for example when a controller processes various data in multiple systems or additional information allows the controller to comply quicker or more targeted. [ 31 ] Article 12(2) GDPR stipulates that in case the controller is unable to identify the data subject, the controller must not refuse to act on the request of a data subject unless the controller demonstrates that it is not in a position to identify the data subject. This provision makes reference to Article 11(2) GDPR which declares that Articles 15 to 20 are not applicable in case the controller cannot identify the data subject (i.e. match the person making a request with the processed personal data) unless the requesting person provides further additional information enabling their identification (see Commentary on Article 11 GDPR for further details). [ 32 ] This situation has to be differentiated from a lack of authentication in case the controller has doubts whether the person making a request is indeed the person who's data is processed. Article 12(5) GDPR however, deals with the case of authentication. In relation to cases under Article 11 GDPR , Article 12(2) GDPR states that the controller may not refuse to act on a request of the data subject to exercise their rights, unless it demonstrates that it is not in a position to identify him or her. It must be stressed, that in accordance with Article 11(2) GDPR , the controller has to inform the data subject accordingly. Obviously, the data subject can provide additional information enabling their identification ( Article 11(2) GDPR ). Controllers should inform the data subject of the nature of what is required to allow identification. This provision, creates a burden of proof and thereby seeks to prevent obstructive tactics relating to alleged difficulties of identification unless these actually exist. [ 33 ] It is unclear why Article 12(2) GDPR refers to Articles 15 to 22 GDPR , while Article 11(2) GDPR only refers to Articles 15 to 20 GDPR - excluding Articles 21 and 22 GDPR . While it is likely a mistake in the drafting process and Articles 21 and 22 GDPR are also meant, some argue that the rights of the controller to refuse request are more limited under Articles 21 and 22 GDPR . [ 34 ] Under Article 12(3) GDPR, the controller must inform the data subject about the \" action taken \" following the receipt of a request under Articles 15 to 22 GDPR . The wording of the law only requires an information about the action taken, but logically this includes the duty to take that action within the relevant deadlines. [ 35 ] Depending on the specific request, the required \" action \" will consist any steps to comply with the rights of the data subject under Articles 15 to 22 GDPR . Given that Article 12(4) also requires an information if no action is taken, there is no option to stay silent for the controller and simply ignore a request. [ 36 ] This must happen as soon as possible (\" without undue delay \") and in any event within one month. This means that if a controller can reasonably take action within a day or week, it cannot wait for a full month to act. It is a matter of the individual case if a controller acted \u201c without undue delay \u201d. While acute staffing shortage, the need to consult external legal council and alike can mean that an action takes longer than a couple of days, waiting with sending an already prepared answer or only starting to act when the one month deadline approaches would violate this provision. [ 37 ] Common mistake: It can often be read or heard that a controller has one month to respond to a request. This is incorrect, a controller must act as soon as possible. The period of one month is just a final deadline, to ensure that controllers cannot interpret \"without undue delay\" to mean more than one month. Any period in the GDPR must be calculated according to Regulation (UE) 1182/71 , which horizontally applies to all EU law. The deadline for data subject's request starts upon receipt of the application. Receipt occurs when the request comes within the controller's sphere of influence and can be noted, such as through digital storage or placement in the controller's mailbox. For example: An organisation receives a request on 5 March. If they can respond within a couple of business days, they must do so. The maximum time limit of one month starts from the same day. This gives the organisation an ultimate deadline until and including 5 April to comply with the request, at the latest. [ 38 ] The one-month deadline may be extended by two months where necessary and if the controller intends to act on the request. The necessity should be evaluated in relation to the complexity and number of requests . The two factors have to be present (at least to some amount) cumulatively [ 39 ] A typical example would be unexpected waives of requests after a data breach or other event that lead unusual numbers of data subjects to contact a controller or the need to engage large numbers of people to respond to a request. [ 40 ] The extension is an exception and therefore is not available during normal operations of a controller or for normal requests that the controller is faced with on a regular basis. Reasons like a generally high number of request or insufficient staff do not allow for an extension since the controller is obliged to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures that ensure compliance with data subjects' requests. [ 41 ] When a controller is unable to comply with the one-month deadline, it must inform the data subject of the reasons for the delay within one month of receiving the request. The extension is not available if a controller does not act on a request, given that Article 12(4) GDPR there is no option for an extension (see Article 12(4) GDPR). The final sentence of Article 12(3) GDPR specifies that where the data subject makes a request by electronic means, and unless otherwise requested by them, the information shall be provided in a commonly used electronic form where possible . The response in an electronic form may not possible if a data subject makes an access request for personal data that is processed in a paper filing system (see Article 2(1) GDPR ). However, in most cases digital information can be provided by electronic means. On the other hand, the wording \" unless otherwise requested by them \" makes clear that the default option for the form of the response - commonly used electronic form - can be changed if the data subject explicitly asks for another format. For example, the data subject can ask for a paper letter even if they made the request by electronic means, as data subjects may be able to send an email with a request, but unable to view and study data in electronic formats. This provision could also be interpreted in providing a general principle, requiring a controller to respond to a request using the same medium as was used by the data subject, making it transparent for the data subject where to expect a response by the controller. [ 42 ] It should be kept in mind, that Article 15(3) GDPR provides for a similar provision requiring that the controller provides the information in a commonly used electronic form if the data subject makes the request by electronic means. Article 12(4) GDPR obliges the controller to inform the data subject without undue delay in case it does not take action on a request by the data subject. Therefore, if a controller does not act on the data subject's request, it must explain to the data subject why this is the case. This provision makes sure that a controller cannot simply ignore a request by a data subject. Even if the controller chooses not to act on the request, a respective information to the data subject is required. [ 43 ] It is important to point out that in its communication to the data subject, the controller must convey the reasons for not taking action . Since this communication refers to the exercise of a data subject's right, the communication has to comply with the requirements of Article 12(1) GDPR, i.e. it has to be in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language (see Article 12(1) GDPR). [ 44 ] Common mistake: The controller is not just obliged to inform the data subject in case it does not comply with a request; e.g. if it does not comply with an erasure request because the data is still needed for the defence of legal claims. This obligation is also applicable, if the controller refuses to act on a request because it is manifestly unfounded or excessive under Article 12(5) GDPR. Just like the information about actions taken in line with Article 12(3) GDPR, the response must be provided without delay (see commentary on Article 12(3) GDPR for more information on the deadline). There is a maximum deadline for a negative response of one month. Other than for a positive response under Article 12(3) GDPR, the controller cannot extend the time for a negative response beyond the absolute deadline of one month. [ 45 ] Generally, it can be said that a controller should not need a whole month in order to assess whether to comply with a request by a data subject. Therefore, the period of one month should rarely be exhausted. For example: A controller may reject the request if it considers that no personal data is being processed, thus not falling in the scope of the GDPR in its entirety, if it finds that the request is \"manifestly unfounded or excessive\" under Article 12(5) GDPR or because it takes the view that it is not the relevant controller. In any case, the entity that receives a request, must provide at least a negative response. In this information to the data subject, the controller must inform the data subject about their right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority under Article 77 GDPR or to seek a judicial remedy under Article 78 GDPR . Article 12(5) GDPR provides for the general principle that the initial information of the data subjects as well as the the exercise of data subject rights is free of charge. However, this provision also allows exceptions from this principle in extreme cases of abuse of these rights. [ 46 ] Covered by this provision are the controller's information obligations under Articles 13 and 14 GDPR and the communications and actions taken under Articles 15 to 22 GDPR (data subject rights) as well as the communication of personal data breaches to data subjects under Article 34 GDPR . The principle of transparency requires that the provision of such information is available to everyone; however, the costs of a data subject for making a request are usually not recoverable. [ 47 ] There are exceptions to the rule that the exercise of rights is free of charge. Namely, in case the request by the data subject is manifestly unfounded or excessive . These exceptions should be interpreted narrowly to avoid undermining the principle of transparency and the principle that requests by data subjects should be free of charge. [ 48 ] A request is considered manifestly unfounded if it does not meet essential legal requirements and is therefore obviously unfounded; the scope for relying on this exception is therefore rather narrow. [ 49 ] For example, for a manifestly unfounded request might be cases in which an obviously unauthorised person wants to assert the rights of a data subject. [ 50 ] The understanding is that the request must be made with abusive intent. [ 51 ] Merely making a broad request or a request that is not covered by the GDPR, because a data subject does not understand the details of the rights under the GDPR is not \" manifestly unfounded \" but may just be a misunderstand that requires a negative response under Article 12(4) GDPR. [ 52 ] It should be stressed that Article 12(5) GDPR in itself does not require a data subject to put forward a reason to justify their request. The fact that a data subject did not provide a justification for exercising a right, therefore is no reason to consider a request (manifestly) unfounded. [ 53 ] There is no definition of the term \u201c excessive \u201d in the GDPR. The example in the law \u201c in particular because of their repetitive character \u201d in Article 12(5) GDPR suggests that the main scenario to which this limb applies is when a data subject uses the free rights under the GDPR to consistently bombard the controller with requests. On the other hand, the qualifier \u201c in particular\u201d indicates that other reasons that might cause excessiveness are not excluded a priori . [ 54 ] A data subject may nonetheless submit more than one request to a controller. In this case, it has to be assessed whether the threshold of reasonable intervals (see Recital 63) has been exceeded. Controllers must take into account the particular circumstances of the single case carefully. In general, \u201c The more often changes occur in the database of the controller, the more often data subjects may be permitted to request access without it being excessive \u201d. [ 55 ] That said, other factors such as the nature of the data, the purpose of the processing and whether the subsequent requests concern the same type of information or processing activities should all be taken into account. [ 56 ] Another relevant factor is the nature of the communication channel between the data subject and controller. Taking the example of an access request, if it is possible to easily provide the relevant information by electronic means or by remote access to a secure system, which makes compliance simple for the controller, it is unlikely that repetitive requests can be regarded as excessive. [ 57 ] In other words: A controller cannot charge a fee when a user downloads his information from a self service tool regularly. The mere scope of a request is not per se \"excessive\", even if a data subject requests access to all personal data a controller holds under Article 15 GDPR . It cannot be held against a data subject if a controller holds massive amounts of personal data on the data subject, nor can a controller rely on the fact that its IT infrastructure is scattered or complex. In an effort to facilitate the quick and accurate response to a request, the controller may ask the data subject if the request concerns only subsets of the processing operation, but if the data subject insists on a broad scope of the request, the controller must comply with the request. [ 58 ] However, a request could be considered excessive if an individual makes a request but offers to withdraw the request against some payment from the controller or if the data subject states a malicious intend in the request itself, e.g. by claiming to make the request only to make exploit the time and effort of the controller. [ 59 ] Article 12(5) GDPR allows for two options to react to manifestly unfounded or excessive requests.  If the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, controllers may either charge a reasonable fee or refuse to act on the request. If information requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular due to their repetitive nature, the data controller may charge a reasonable fee. This exception must be interpreted restrictively in order to not excessively constrain data subjects\u2019 right to information. The amount should be based on the costs of the controller to comply with the request. [ 60 ] It is argued that controllers should inform data subjects of their intention to charge them a reasonable fee based on Article 12(5) GDPR before doing so, to allow them to decide whether they should withdraw their request to avoid being charged. [ 61 ] Alternatively, if requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, the controller can outright refuse to act on the request. If the controller refuses to act, it must inform the data subject accordingly (see Article 12(4) GDPR). Such a response should include a reason why they refuse to act as well as inform them about the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority and the possibility to seek a judicial remedy. [ 62 ] The relationship between these two options is not clarified by the GDPR. The wording of Article 12(5) GDPR seems to suggest that the controller has a free choice between the two alternatives. Nonetheless, it has been pointed out that a refusal to act can violate the good faith principle to the extent that the data subject offers to pay a reasonable fee. [ 63 ] Equally, leaving the choice to the data subject would be more proportionate option, when the provision is interpreted in light of Article 8(2) and 52(1) CFR. [ 64 ] Reference can also be made to the CJEU interpreting the same wording in the context of the supervisory authority's obligation to handle a request unless it is \" manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character,\" which held that a supervisory authority \" may choose, by reasoned decision, between charging a reasonable fee based on administrative costs and refusing to act on those requests, taking account of all the relevant circumstances and satisfying itself that the chosen option is appropriate, necessary and proportionate. \" [ 65 ] Finally, the law highlights that the controller bears the burden of proof that a request was manifestly unfounded or excessive. In these cases, controllers must be able to demonstrate the manifestly unfounded or excessive character of a request (Article 12(5), third sentence, GDPR). Hence, controllers should maintain a proper documentation of the underlying facts. [ 66 ] Article 12(6) GDPR deals with the case that the controller has reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the natural person exercises a right under Articles 15 to 21 GDPR. In this case the controller may request that the data subject provides additional information in order to confirm the identity of the data subject. In other words, a controller can request additional information from a person making a request if this information is necessary to confirm that this person is indeed the data subject, the request refers to. Contrary to problems identifying the personal data that is subject to a request described in Article 11 GDPR and Article 12(2) GDPR, Article 12(6) concerns issues of authentication. This means, that while the relevant personal data can be found, the controller may have reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the natural person making the request and if the person requesting the information is the actual data subject. For example: If a controller receives a request from a data subject under their real name, requesting deletion of their IP-address stored in the controller's database, the controller is unable to identify the data subject (i.e. match the processed data with the person making the request). This is an issue of identification and subject to Article 12 GDPR. If, however, a person requests access to his personal data from a doctor under their real name and the doctor can match the person to the data of one of its patients but is unsure whether the person making the request is indeed the person they claim they are, they can request additional information necessary to confirm their identity in order to make sure they don't provide the data to the wrong person. This is a case of authentication and subject to Article 12(6) GDPR. A controller can only request additional information from the data subject, in case it has reasonable doubts regarding their identity. This means that the controller, receiving a request from a natural person, has doubts whether that person is indeed the data subject entitled to make the request. [ 67 ] The doubts by the controller must be reasonable; therefore, a controller cannot always require additional information (like a scan of an ID) even if it has no reasonable doubts regarding the data subject's identity. [ 68 ] Such a practice would violate the controller's obligation to facilitate data subjects' rights as stipulated in Article 12(2) GDPR. [ 69 ] Therefore, the data subject has to co-operate with the controller in case they are required to provide additional information. [ 70 ] Proper authentication of the person requesting the information is crucial, given the risk of disclosing personal data to an unauthorised person which, for example, might contribute to identity theft. Not establishing a proper system for authentication would usually constitute a violation of various provisions of the GDPR, such as Articles 5(1)(f) or 32 GDPR. Therefore, if the controller has reasonable doubts concerning the identity of a natural person making a request under Articles 15 to 21 GDPR , additional information must be requested to verify their identity. [ 71 ] This provision refers to the requests referred to in Articles 15 to 21 GDPR. Article 22 GDPR is not mentioned. The reason for omitting Article 22 GDPR - particularly the right to obtain human intervention, express a point of view and contest a decision - is unclear and it is argued that the provision should apply to Article 22 GDPR as well. [ 72 ] Other than Article 11 and 12(2) GDPR, when personal data is simply not identifiable, the lack of authentication does not allow to reject a request under Articles 15 to 21 GDPR . Instead, the controller must request additional information that allows the authentication. Article 12(6) GDPR does not foresee that a controller is unable to authenticate a data subject. Only in the case that the data subject refuses to cooperate and provide additional information can the controller refuse to comply with the data subject's request. [ 73 ] The authentication of data subjects must not lead to excessive demands and to the collection of personal data which are not relevant or necessary to strengthen the link between the individual and the personal data requested. That means that the controller cannot collect more data than necessary to authenticate the requesting person. [ 74 ] \"[T]he controller shall carry out a proportionality assessment, which must take into account the type of personal data being processed (e.g. special categories of data or not), the nature of the request, the context within which the request is being made, as well as any damage that could result from improper disclosure. When assessing proportionality, it should be remembered to avoid excessive data collection while ensuring an adequate level of processing security.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.1), margin number 70. The method used for authentication should be relevant, appropriate, proportionate and respect the data minimisation principle ; any burdensome measures must be adequately justified by the controller in order to comply with its duty to facilitate data subjects' rights. [ 75 ] The controller should also consider the risk to the data subjects in such an assessment; e.g. the risk for the data subject is smaller when it comes to complying with an objection to a processing activity for marketing purposes under Article 21 GDPR compared to the risk when sensitive data is disclosed to a requesting person due to an access request under Article 15 GDPR . [ 76 ] Common mistake: It is common that controllers just require some form of government issued identification or proof of address, even when the controller has no information to match this against. In some countries, residents are not required to have a government ID. Some form of proof of identity or addresses may also not be common in certain jurisdictions. For instance, when a given processing operation begins with the storage of a cookie into the user's device, a controller cannot ask the data subject to provide IDs, signatures and in general anything that cannot help the identification purpose. [ 77 ] In the context of online services, the data subject can be authenticated, inter alia , by sending a secret code, answering questions that only the data subject knows, have a user log in to a platform, send a link containing a unique token to their email address, or any other contact method used for the registration. Insofar as a digital communication channel already exists between the data subject and the controller, the controller should implement or re-use an authentication procedure in order to ascertain the identity of the data subjects requesting their personal data or exercising the rights granted by the GDPR. [ 78 ] For example: A user signs up to a social network by providing their email and generating a login password. After a few years of use, they decide to make an access request under Article 15 GDPR via email. Upon receipt of the email, the controller requests the user to send a scan of their identification document to verify their identity. Requiring IDs when they are not necessary constitutes a breach of the obligation to facilitate the exercise of rights, as the controller could implement less burdensome and instrusive verification mechanisms, such as asking the user to log in or sending a verification code to the email address. [ 79 ] The limitation to request only \" necessary \" information also means that the controller cannot insist on a specific form of authentication, if a data subject provides other information that ensures sufficient authentication. It is therefore for the data subject to provide (any) \" necessary \" information, while the controller has a duty to facilitate (see Article 12(1) GDPR) the exercise and may suggest certain, easy forms of authentication. Article 12(7) GDPR establishes the option to provide the information under Articles 13 and 14 GDPR in combination with standardised icons . The scope of this information is therefore explicitly the initial information of data subjects regarding the processing of their personal data as stipulated in Articles 13 and 14 GDPR. This provision is based on the assumption that it is easier to provide information using visual aids, rather than using plaint text alone. [ 80 ] Therefore it can be appropriate to use visualisations (e.g. standardised icons) in order to increase the transparency of the information provided to data subjects. [ 81 ] During the negotiations on the GDPR, some Members of the European Parliament have proposed to use icons to communicate privacy information. [ 82 ] However, the foreseen icons did not make it into the final text of the GDPR - instead there is now an option for the European Commission to issue a delegated act under Article 12(8) GDPR to define such icons (see below). The originally proposed symbols partly concerned the compliance with minimum standards under the GDPR and would have had little benefit for data subjects, as every controller would have to carry the same symbols. Arguably, icons and symbols have more relevance when it comes to optional elements (e.g. use of personal data for advertisement, sharing of personal data or transfer of personal data outside of the EEA and alike). The purpose of using standardised icons in the information of data subjects is to make the information more accessible to the data subjects. Transparency should be increased, on the one hand, by reducing the need for vast amounts of written information to be presented to a data subject, on the other hand, it should be possible for the data subject to grasp the fundamentals of the processing activity by a glance at expressive icons. [ 83 ] It is therefore a tool against the problems of information fatigue and information overload. [ 84 ] With this knowledge, the data subjects should be in a position to evaluate the lawfulness of the processing activity and to exercise their rights under the GDPR. [ 85 ] It should be noted that Article 12(7) GDPR only provides for the option to inform data subjects about a processing activity in combination with standardised icons. Therefore, standardised icons alone are not a suitable way of informing data subjects about the processing of their data in accordance with Article 13 and 14 GDPR. This should make sure that the usage of standardised icons does not lower the level of protection for data subjects by decreasing the amount of information provided to them. [ 86 ] \"[T]he use of icons should not simply replace information necessary for the exercise of a data subject\u2019s rights nor should they be used as a substitute to compliance with the data controller\u2019s obligations under Articles 13 and 14\" WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018, margin number 50. Instead, icons could be used in a multi-layered approach and provide data subjects with some fundamental information about the processing activity while the further information is mainly contained in the privacy policy accessible by a link. [ 87 ] In case the icons are presented electronically, Article 12(7) GDPR requires that the icons are also machine-readable. This should for example enable a browser to automatically avoid websites that declare a specific processing activity or help to make privacy notices more accessible for people with an impairment of their vision. [ 88 ] However, without the implementation of standardised icons, this provision lacks practical importance at this point. Article 12(8) GDPR empowers the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 92 GDPR for the purpose of determining the information to be presented by the icons mentioned in Article 12(7) GDPR as well as procedures for providing standardised icons. Its competence does not include the binding establishment of specific icons. Per Recital 166 GDPR, the process of developing a code of icons should involve the carrying out of consultations and research on the efficacy of icons. Article 12(8) GDPR does not expressly specify whose responsibility it is to conduct such research, meaning standardised icons could come from either the Commission or standard-setting organisations. However, Article 71(1)(r) GDPR tasks the EDPB to provide the Commission with an opinion on the icons referred to in Article 12(7)GDPR. \"[T]he utility of icons to effectively convey information required under Articles 13 and 14 to data subjects is dependent upon the standardisation of symbols/ images to be universally used and recognised across the EU as shorthand for that information. In this regard, the GDPR assigns responsibility for the development of a code of icons to the Commission but ultimately the European Data Protection Board may, either at the request of the Commission or of its own accord, provide the Commission with an opinion on such icons. [I]n line with Recital 166, the development of a code of icons should be centred upon an evidence-based approach and in advance of any such standardisation it will be necessary for extensive research to be conducted in conjunction with industry and the wider public as to the efficacy of icons in this context.\" WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018, margin number 52 (footnotes emitted). So far the European Commission has not used this power and there are no known plans to issue such an implementing decision. Even if such a decision by the Commission would be issued, using these icons is optional (\" may \"). Therefore the provision therefore has no practical relevance. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 12 GDPR \u2191 Dix , in Simitis, Hornung, Spiecker gen.

Along these lines, the CJEU criticised the behaviour of a controller \" in the absence of any indications confirming that that clause was actually read and digested \". See, CJEU, C\u201161/19, Orange Rom\u00e2nia , 11 November 2020, margin number 46 (available here ). \u2191 This provision is particularly important when considering the German doctrine of informational self-determination, according to which, substantive rights of data subjects can only serve their purpose when supported by clear information as well as proportionate and effective procedures.

from the data subject 1.   Where personal data relating to a data subject are collected from the data subject, the controller shall, at the time when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with all of the following information: 2.   In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall, at the time when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with the following further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing: 3.   Where the controller intends to further process the personal data for a purpose other than that for which the personal data were collected, the controller shall provide the data subject prior to that further processing with information on that other purpose and with any relevant further information as referred to in paragraph 2. 4.   Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply where and insofar as the data subject already has the information. Article 13 GDPR provides for the controller's obligation to inform data subjects about the processing of their personal data. This requirement to initially inform the data subjects plays a core role in realizing the principle of transparency in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR . The information of data subjects is supposed to enable them (at least theoretically) to make informed decisions about the processing of their data (e.g. the use of a service or product and the exercise of their rights under the GDPR). [ 1 ] The information obligation also requires the controller to go on public record regarding the use of personal data, demanding the consideration of numerous issues relating to the processing activity prior to any request by a data subject. Article 13 GDPR outlines the controller's obligation to actively provide clear and comprehensive information to individuals about the processing of their personal data and must be read in conjunction with Article 12 GDPR which governs general rules on transparency and modalities applicable to information obligations as well as data subjects rights. [ 2 ] Article 13 GDPR applies in situations where personal data are collected directly from the data subjects, while Article 14 GDPR applies in all other situations (e.g. when personal data have been obtained from a third party). Both provisions however have a similar structure and content, as they both describe the specific pieces of information that controllers must provide to data subjects. Article 13 GDPR is divided into 4 paragraphs. The first two paragraphs list elements the controller needs to include in its information to the data subject. [ 3 ] The third paragraph defines the obligation to notify the data subject when the controller intends to process the data subject's personal data for a purpose other than the purpose for which the data were originally collected (i.e. further processing). Lastly, the fourth paragraph provides for an exemption of the information obligation in case the data subject already possesses the information. WP29 and EDPB Guidelines : For this Article, see the following Guidelines: WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018 (available here ); and EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.1) (available here ). Paragraph 1 clarifies the scope of application of Article 13 GDPR. The information in question must be provided when personal data is \" collected from the data subject \". Collection occurs whenever personal data comes into the possession of the controller. This includes operations such as receiving data included in a paper or digital form, collecting IP addresses and associated actions, reading cookies, or gathering usage data from a device (e.g. a fitness tracker) or application. [ 4 ] This requirement necessitates a certain contextual relationship between the action of collecting data and the physical or digital presence of the data subject; however, it is not necessary that the data subject actively (or knowingly) provides the information to the controller. [ 5 ] Therefore, the data collection directly from the data subject includes personal data that: a data subject consciously provides to a data controller (e.g. when completing an online form); or a data controller collects from a data subject by observation without the knowledge of the data subject (e.g. using automated data capturing devices or surveillance cameras, network equipment, Wi-Fi tracking, RFID or other types of sensors). [ 6 ] \"In the light of the wording of Article 14(2)(f) of the GDPR, read in the light of recital 61 of that regulation, it must be held that only the source of the personal data collected is the relevant criterion for the purposes of determining the respective scopes of Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR. Under Article 14(2)(f), where the data have not been obtained from the data subject, the controller must inform the data subject of the source of the personal data.\" CJEU - Case C-422/24 - AB Storstockholms Lokaltrafik , margin number 35. For example: A provider of public transportation employs ticket inspectors wearing body cameras in order to record infringements of the applicable transportation provisions as well as dangerous situations. The collection of data by means of body cameras worn by those inspectors constitutes the collection of personal data directly from data subjects. Therefore, the information obligation under Article 13 GDPR applies. [ 7 ] The information must be given \" at the time data is obtained \". The wording of the law therefore requires information at least parallel to the beginning of the processing operation. [ 8 ] The idea of the legislator is that in case where information is directly obtained from the data subject, the controller and the data subjects are in some kind of contact with each other which enables the controller to provide the information in the course of the data collection. In effect, the information must be provided to the data subject prior to the data collection. [ 9 ] Otherwise, it would run counter to the purpose of the information obligation (e.g. informing the data subject whether they are obliged to provide the information is only meaningful prior to the collection). \"As regards timing of the provision of this information, providing it in a timely manner is a vital element of the transparency obligation and the obligation to process data fairly.\" WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018, margin number 27. Obviously, there are some cases where this poses difficulties to the controller. E.g. in case the data subject, on its own initiative, sends some personal data to the controller without any prior communication. In such a case the information should be provided without undue delay to the data subject. [ 10 ] Because the initial information must be provided to the data subject when personal data is first obtained (or in case of Article 14 GDPR, at least close in time to the collection) [ 11 ] , any information provided under Article 13 and Article 14 GDPR is necessarily an ex-ante information that should clearly reflect the intentions of the controller but is potentially subject to change. This means that not all provided information must necessarily become applicable to the personal data of the data subject. A controller could for example inform about different processing activities that are reasonably likely but not certain to materialise (e.g. instructing a debt collection agency to collect outstanding debts). Similarly, some information might change during the processing activity (e.g. a controller could exchange a processor). With the principles of transparency and fairness in mind, such change after the initial information requires the information of the data subject about the intentions of the controller, as well as possible future processing of personal data. In reality, personal data could be used in a different way, for example because certain described processing operations never occurred or the controller (for lawful or unlawful reasons) deviated from the information given under Article 13 and Article 14 GDPR . Obviously the controller has to update and inform the data subjects if such situations occur and may even need to proactively inform them (see below paragraph 3 for the change of purposes). \"Changes to a privacy statement/notice that should always be communicated to data subjects include inter alia: a change in processing purpose; a change to the identity of the controller; or a change as to how data subjects can exercise their rights in relation to the processing. Conversely, an example of changes to a privacy statement/notice which are not considered by WP29 to be substantive or material, include corrections of misspellings, or stylistic/ grammatical flaws. Since most existing customers or users will only glance over communications of changes to privacy statements/notices, the controller should take all measures necessary to ensure that these changes are communicated in such a way that ensures that most recipients will actually notice them. This means, for example, that a notification of changes should always be communicated by way of an appropriate modality (e.g. email, hard copy letter, pop-up on a webpage or other modality which will effectively bring the changes to the attention of the data subject) specifically devoted to those changes (e.g. not together with direct marketing content), with such a communication meeting the Article 12 GDPR requirements of being concise, transparent, intelligible, easily accessible and using clear and plain language. References in the privacy statement/notice to the effect that the data subject should regularly check the privacy statement/notice for changes or updates are considered not only insufficient but also unfair in the context of Article 5(1)(a).\" WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018, margin number 29 (available here). Contrary to the ex-ante information obligation, data subjects always have the option to request information about the actual use of their personal data from an ex-post perspective via the right to access under Article 15 GDPR . This would also reveal if certain options (e.g. sharing with others) was actually taking place and may also allow to provide more specific information as the actual use of the personal data of a specific data subject. For example: The controller may only make personal data available to an external recipient in rare cases (e.g. if a user does not pay his bills) which cannot be ruled out ex-ante. If a data subjects makes a request at a later stage, the controller can clarify that the personal data of the specific data subject was in fact not disclosed. The controller has to provide the information to the data subjects. The controller is therefore required to proactively furnish the information to the data subject. [ 12 ] \"This means that the data controller must take active steps to furnish the information in question to the data subject or to actively direct the data subject to the location of it (e.g. by way of a direct link, use of a QR code, etc.). The data subject must not have to actively search for information covered by these articles amongst other information, such as terms and conditions of use of a website or app.\" WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018, margin number 33. The provision of the information must also comply with the requirements of Article 12(1) GDPR ; in particular, it must be provided in a transparent, easily accessible form. Consequently, it must be distinguishable from other information, such as the terms of use of a website or the clauses of a contract. [ 13 ] The information required by Article 13 (or Article 14) GDPR should be provided in a single document. [ 14 ] Such document is commonly referred to as privacy notice or privacy policy and can be provided in written or electronic form (often as an annex to a contract, a hard-copy document or an online multilayered document). To avoid discrepancies and ensure a uniform and sufficient level of information of the data subjects, the EU legislator did not leave the content of such information to the discretion of controllers. Hence, Article 13(1) GDPR meticulously lists which elements must be provided to the data subjects when personal data are obtained. The first piece of information that must be provided to the data subject is the identity of the controller . This information is a prerequisite for the data subject to be able to understand who processes their personal data. The information about the controller's identity should include the full name of the controller (e.g. the name of a company as it is registered in the company\u2019s register). [ 15 ] The controller's contact details are necessary for the data subjects to get in touch with the controller and to further exercise their rights under the GDPR. The contact details must enable data subjects to easily contact the controller and should include different forms of communications. \"This information should allow for easy identification of the controller and preferably allow for different forms of communications with the data controller (e.g. phone number, email, postal address, etc).\" WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018, p. 35. While at least a postal address must be provided under which the controller is reachable, electronic contact details might be necessary as well. [ 16 ] This conclusion is supported by logical and systematic reasons. Primarily, providing an electronic contact point could be necessary in order to comply with the controller's obligation to facilitate the exercise of data subjects' rights under Article 12(2) GDPR . For example, it would would a, potentially unlawful, burden to require a data subject residing in Europe to contact a far-away controller via regular mail in order to exercise their GDPR rights. Also, depending on the location of the controller, various practical obstacles could arise, including the slowness of regular mail, especially when back-and-forth communication with the controller is necessary. Moreover, such means could entail significant costs for the data subject whilst the exercise of GDPR rights is in principle \" free of charge \" ( Article 12(5) GDPR) . While online contact forms, chat bots or alike do not constitute \" contact details \" as required by Article 13(1)(a) GDPR, some controllers, offer such options. In particular, when using an online contact form, data subjects are usually required to fill in some mandatory fields, such as a name, email address or the nature of the request which might be in conflict with the principle of data minimisation under Article 5(1)(c) GDPR . In any case, such tools can be used in order to provide data subjects an easy way to contact the controller but the data subject must be able to contact the controller without having to create an account. [ 17 ] Therefore, these tools may serve as additional means that the controller may provide to facilitate contacts with the data subjects. [ 18 ] Article 13(1)(a) GDPR further requires that, where applicable, the identity and contact details of the controller's representative are provided. This refers to the representative as defined in Article 4(17) GDPR that needs to be designated by controllers not established in the Union (see Article 27 GDPR ). [ 19 ] In accordance with Article 13(1)(b) GDPR, the controller has to provide the contact details of its data protection officer (\"DPO\"), if the controller has appointed one. Article 37 GDPR may require that a controller designates a DPO who has the duty to oversee the processing activities conducted by the controller and to act as a point of contact for the data subjects. [ 20 ] However, the obligation to inform data subjects about the DPO's contact details is also applicable if the controller appointed a DPO without being required to do so. [ 21 ] The contact details of the DPO should include information allowing data subjects to reach the DPO in an easy way. [ 22 ] This may include a postal address, a dedicated telephone number, and/or a dedicated e-mail address. [ 23 ] It is not necessary to include the DPO's name in the information provided to data subjects. [ 24 ] The tasks of a DPO listed in Article 39 GDPR do not indicate that the DPO would usually respond to questions or the exercise of rights by the data subjects. However, the DPO does serve as a contact point for the authorities and may be informed about potential non-compliance of the controller by the wider public. The provision of the contract details should allow to perform these tasks. According to Article 13(1)(c), controllers must specify the purposes for which the collected personal data are intended as well as the corresponding legal basis . Article 5(1)(b) GDPR requires that personal data is collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes. [ 25 ] The controller must disclose them to the data subject, to ensure that the data subject can assess why their data is processed and whether they consider the purpose of the processing lawful. The information about the purpose has to be detailed enough to enable such an assessment. [ 26 ] The EDPB provided useful examples of insufficient and sufficient declarations of the purpose: Poor Practice Examples The following phrases are not sufficiently clear as to the purposes of processing: -\u201cWe may use your personal data to develop new services\u201d (as it is unclear what the \u201cservices\u201d are or how the data will help develop them); -\u201cWe may use your personal data for research purposes (as it is unclear what kind of \u201cresearch\u201d this refers to); and -\u201cWe may use your personal data to offer personalised services\u201d (as it is unclear what the \u201cpersonalisation\u201d entails). Good Practice Examples -\u201cWe will retain your shopping history and use details of the products you have previously purchased to make suggestions to you for other products which we believe you will also be interested in \u201d (it is clear that what types of data will be processed, that the data subject will be subject to targeted advertisements for products and that their data will be used to enable this); -\u201cWe will retain and evaluate information on your recent visits to our website and how you move around different sections of our website for analytics purposes to understand how people use our website so that we can make it more intuitive\u201d (it is clear what type of data will be processed and the type of analysis which the controller is going to undertake); and -\u201cWe will keep a record of the articles on our website that you have clicked on and use that information to target advertising on this website to you that is relevant to your interests, which we have identified based on articles you have read\u201d (it is clear what the personalisation entails and how the interests attributed to the data subject have been identified). WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018, margin number 12. Any processing activity must be based on a legal basis found in Article 6(1) GDPR . The controller is under the obligation to inform data subjects about the particular legal basis invoked to process their personal data. Where special categories of personal data are processed, the controller has to additionally name the relevant exemption in Article 9(2) GDPR allowing for that processing. Where personal data relating to criminal matters are being processed under Article 10 GDPR (e.g. copy of the criminal record of a job applicant), the controller should also indicate, in addition to the legal basis applicable under Article 6(1) GDPR , what is the relevant EU or Member State law allowing such processing to be carried out. [ 27 ] It should be noted that specific legal bases demand additional provided information (e.g. in case of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR , the legitimate interest pursued). Further, it might be necessary to explain the requirements of the invoked legal basis to data subjects. E.g. if the processing of personal data is necessary to comply with a legal obligation ( Article 6(1)(c) GDPR ), the controller should name the legal obligation. [ 28 ] Unlike Article 14(1)(d) GDPR , Article 13 GDPR does not provide for the obligation to inform about the categories of personal data , since, in case the personal data are collected from the data subject directly, it is assumed that the data subject is aware of the specific information collected by the controller. [ 29 ] However, in order to increase transparency, it is recommended to describe the categories of processed personal data even when data are collected from the data subject and the information is provided in accordance with Article 13 GDPR. Regularly, controllers with larger amounts of personal data disclose a first layer of information that names certain groups of personal data (like contact details, information about your orders, payment information). In a second layer, the information is then specified down to the specific data points (like name, email address or credit card number). In case a controller processes the personal data of data subjects for multiple purposes and on the basis of several legal bases, it is important to clarify in a transparent manner which personal data is possessed for which purpose on which legal basis. Simply listing all categories of personal data, all purposes and all legal bases without disclosing the necessary relationship between the information is insufficient. [ 30 ] In contrary, a mere list of types of personal data, various legal bases under Article 6(1) GDPR and another long list of purposes would provide almost no actual information to the data subject. In particular, a data subject would not be able to asses if it can withdraw consent under Article 7(3) , object under Article 21 GDPR or if the processing is in fact compliant with the principles of Article 5(1) GDPR . For example: A pharmacy collects health data and address data of clients. It uses the address data for marketing (sending newsletters each month and postal mail for Christmas) and the health data only insofar as necessary to sell products, charge the health insurance companies, and to comply with the legal obligation to keep records. A privacy policy that does not link the different types of personal data, with the legal basis and the purpose (e.g. data: email / legal basis: consent / purpose: marketing) would suggest that the pharmacy could use health data for marketing purposes under a (non-existent) legal obligation under Article 6(1)(c) GDPR. Such information is not transparent and does not facilitate the exercise of rights. Therefore, compliance with Article 13 GDPR demands that the information to data subjects makes the relationship between the different parts of the information transparent. The obligation to such a link can also be inferred from the GDPR\u2019s transparency obligations in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and the requirement to provide the information in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language ( Article 12(1) GDPR ). In practice, to reconcile the obligation to provide both complete and concise information to the data subjects [ 31 ] , many controllers provide this information in the form of a table with different rows and columns clearly distinguishing between the different purposes of the processing and their corresponding legal basis. This table may be added within the privacy notice of the controller, or as an annex to it. For example: A streaming provider includes a table in the privacy policy, where each line holds the information about the purposes, the legal basis and the relevant type of personal data. This way any data subject can identify which personal data is used for which purpose and under which legal basis. When a controller relies on a legitimate interest for the processing of personal data, as provided for under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR , the data subjects must be properly informed about the nature of that specific interest , as required by Article 13(1)(d) GDPR. \" Article 13(1)(d) requires the controller directly to inform the data subjects of the legitimate interest pursued at the time when the data is collected, otherwise that collection cannot be justified on the basis of point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of that regulation.\" CJEU - C-394/23 Mousse , margin number 52. For example: \"A controller, on the basis of a legitimate interest, processes the IP address of data subjects to filter DDOS attacks and other security threats. At the same time, the controller also uses this personal data for advertisement purposes. The controller's specific interest behind that processing should be clearly explained in the privacy notice, to ensure that a data subject can understand the legitimate interest relied upon. A data subject may accept that security is a legitimate interest, but may take the view that advertisement is not.\" With this information, the data subject can indeed assess whether the interest invoked by the controller is truly legitimate and if the processing is proportionate, taking into account the objective pursued by the controller, and the impact that it can have on its own rights and interests. [ 32 ] If the data subject finds that the processing is disproportionate, it may challenge the reliance on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR or at least exercise the right to object under Article 21 GDPR . If the information provided to the data subject is incomplete or unclear, the controller can be fined for breach of Article 13(1)(d) GDPR. [ 33 ] The EDPB seems to consider it also necessary that the controller provides the data subject with information from the balancing test, which the controller must normally carry out under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR before collecting the personal data. [ 34 ] \"[T]he controller can also provide the data subject with information from the balancing test in advance of any collection of personal data. To avoid information fatigue, this can be included within a layered privacy statement/notice. In any case, information to the data subjects should make it clear that they can obtain information on the balancing test upon request. This is essential to ensure effective transparency and to allow data subjects to dispel possible doubts as to whether the balancing test has been carried out fairly by the controller or assess whether they might have grounds to file a complaint with a supervisory authority. Such transparency obligation also follows from the accountability principle in Article 5(2) GDPR, which requires the controller to be able to demonstrate compliance with each of the principles set out in Article 5(1) GDPR, including the lawfulness principle.\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 1/2024 on processing of personal data based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR', 8 October 2024 (Version 1), margin number 68; footnotes omitted. The data subjects might need the information as a precondition to effectively exercise their right under Article 21(1) GDPR . If a data subject is not aware if a specific circumstance was considered by the controller, it is hard to raise a \" particular situation \" that was not considered as required under Article 21(1) GDPR . It seems equally hard to challenge the balancing assessment under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR if it is not disclosed. Therefore, it can be argued that the balancing test must also be disclosed. [ 35 ] Article 13(1)(e) GDPR provides that when controllers disclose personal data to internal or external recipients, they should identify such recipients. The term \" recipient \" is defined in Article 4(9) GDPR as any entity to which personal data is factually disclosed. The legal role of the recipient is irrelevant. It is not necessary for the recipient to be a third party as defined in Article 4(10) GDPR . Therefore, for example processors are also considered recipients. [ 36 ] There may be exemptions for certain public authorities receiving personal data under Article 4(9) GDPR. For example: In a privacy notice addressed to the employees of a company, all recipients of the employee's data should be identified. Meaning any external party that has factual access to the information, such as the processors, external service companies or an external accountant. The wording of Article 13(1)(e) GDPR refers to \"recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data\" which leaves it open if (or when) it is sufficient to name the categories of recipients rather than the specific recipients. In light of the principles of fairness and transparency, controllers should provide information on the individual third party recipients, so that the data subjects are aware of the persons with whom their data will be shared externally and exercise their rights also against the recipients directly. [ 37 ] \"The actual (named) recipients of the personal data, or the categories of recipients, must be provided. In accordance with the principle of fairness, controllers must provide information on the recipients that is most meaningful for data subjects. In practice, this will generally be the named recipients, so that data subjects know exactly who has their personal data. If controllers opt to provide the categories of recipients, the information should be as specific as possible by indicating the type of recipient (i.e. by reference to the activities it carries out), the industry, sector and sub-sector and the location of the recipients.\" WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018, p. 37. Only if it is not possible to identify all the recipients (for example, because the recipients may not be foreseeable or are not known by the controller, which may be the case for a public database), the controllers must at least identify the categories of recipients of the personal data. [ 38 ] In such case, the WP29 considers that this information should be as specific as possible by including a reference to the activities they carry out, the industry, sector/sub-sector and the location of the recipients. [ 39 ] Just naming generic groups like \" partners \" or \" third parties \" is not sufficient. For example: A controller runs a public database, that the data subject entered its information in. The controller uses two processors, that are known to him, but some of the data can also be retrieved by any user of the service. The privacy policy should name the individual known processors (e.g. \"Web Service Provider A, Example Road 1, Member State X\") but also refer to the unknown recipients as a category of recipients (e.g. \"any user of the service\"). To ensure that the information is both complete, concise and intelligible, controllers can establish a table of recipients, where the different recipients of the personal data are named, or - if categories of recipients are mentioned instead - their qualification is indicated as clearly and narrow as possible. In line with the requirements under Article 12 GDPR , the controller must also link which personal data are available to which recipient, if only certain data are shared. For example: An online shop may inform that all data are stored with a specific hosting provider, consumer requests are stored with a provider of a CRM system and only the address information is shared with a postal service. Article 13(1)(f) GDPR covers information on transfers of personal data to international organisations or third countries, e.g. any country located outside of the European Economic Area (EEA). [ 40 ] In case of data transfers to third countries (which are regulated in Articles 44 to 50 GDPR ), controllers should inform data subjects about the existence of such transfers, name all the relevant countries, and specify the safeguards relied upon. For example: A controller transfers personal data to a business partner located in Japan. It must list Japan as being one of the transfer location, and mention whether such transfer is based on the Commission's adequacy decision between the EU and Japan, [ 41 ] or on standard contractual clauses signed with the data importer or another legal basis. [ 42 ] Besides mentioning the third countries or international organisations where data importers are located, the controller must also inform the data subject about the means by which to obtain a copy of the applicable safeguards. For example, if the applicable safeguard is an adequacy decision adopted by the Commission pursuant to Article 45 GDPR , the controller could add an hyperlink [ 43 ] redirecting the data subject towards the relevant decision as published on EURlex (the official website of EU legislation). Or, if the applicable safeguard is a transfer agreement signed by the controller and the data importer containing the standard contractual clauses referred to in Article 46(2)(c) GDPR , the controller could equally provide a link to the document or state that the data subjects may obtain a copy of the agreement upon request, for example by sending an email to the controller. [ 44 ] It is worth noting at this stage that data importers are necessarily recipients of personal data in the sense of Article 4(9) GDPR . Hence, all data importers to which personal data are transferred should have already been identified by the controller pursuant to Article 13(1)(e) GDPR, as discussed here above. The second paragraph of Article 13 GDPR provides for an additional set of information that must be provided to the data subjects at the time of the collection of their personal data. The distinction between the set of mandatory information listed in the first paragraph and in the second paragraph of Article 13 GDPR is to be explained from the drafting process, where the Council suggested that paragraph 2 should only be provided in certain situations, [ 45 ] while the European Parliament insisted that paragraphs 1 and 2 must always be provided. This was achieved by turning a condition (\" such further information that is necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing \") to an explanation (\" to ensure fair and transparent processing \"). The fact that the list is split in two paragraphs is hence purely due to the political process and does not have any practical consequences for the controllers or for the data subjects. [ 46 ] The obligations in both paragraphs are equally binding to the controller. Article 13(2)(a) GDPR stipulates that the controller must inform the data subjects about the period for which their personal data will be stored (e.g. the 'retention period' or 'storage period'). If it is not possible for the controller to disclose a specific date or amount of time (for example, because the retention period may depend on factors that are not determined), the criteria used to determine that period should at least be given. For example: A controller selling goods online could indicate that the personal data of the data subjects will be stored \"for 7 years after their purchase under our legal obligation to keep tax records\", or that customer service interactions will be kept \"for a period of 3 months from the last message we received from you\". By making it mandatory for the controller to publish clear retention periods, Article 13(2)(a) GDPR requires the controller to publicly declare its compliance with the principle of storage limitation enshrined in Article 5(1)(e) GDPR , which requires the deletion or anonymisation of personal data when it is not necessary anymore to achieve the purpose. For example: A controller states that the retention period of the personal data is 5 years, \"after which the data will be archived\". This would breach the data minimisation principle. Rather, the archiving period should be included within the retention period. With the provided information, data subjects should be capable to assess the duration for which their personal data will be processed by the controller. [ 47 ] As different categories of personal data may be needed for shorter or longer periods of time, depending on the purpose of the processing, controllers should distinguish between those categories and stipulate the applicable retention period for each of them. Furthermore, the retention periods - or the criteria used to calculate them - should be specific enough for the data subjects to be able to at least form an idea of how long their personal data will be kept before being deleted or anonymised. For example: It would not be sufficient for the data controller to generically state that personal data will be kept as long as necessary for the legitimate purposes of the company. Similarly, if a controller provides that the data will be stored to comply with a legal obligation, it should specify which legal obligation it refers to. [ 48 ] In principle, the information about the period for which the personal data will be stored includes also some information about the time when the information is collected. However, in case of Article 13, when the data are collected from the data subject, it can often be assumed that the data subject is aware about the time of the beginning of the processing. [ 49 ] Many data subjects are not aware of their rights. The controller is therefore required to inform the data subjects about (most of) their rights under data protection law, namely their right to access , rectification , erasure , restriction of processing , data portability and their right to object . It is not enough to merely inform a data subject about the existence of those rights, the controller should also include \u201c a summary of what each right involves and how the data subject can take steps to exercise it and any limitations on the right \u201d. [ 50 ] Controllers can enumerate these rights in the privacy notice and then refer the data subjects to an annex or another page where those rights and the manner in which they can be exercised are explained in more detail. In addition to this, the GDPR requires controllers to explicitly bring the right to object to the data subject\u2019s attention at the latest at the time of first communication with the data subject, in a clear manner, and separately from any other information. [ 51 ] This can be done, for example, the first time an email is sent to the data subject in the context of direct marketing. Regarding the right to object and data portability, the controller should assess whether the conditions of those rights apply to the specific processing activity. If not, it might omit this information in order to avoid making the impression that the data subjects had rights that do not exist for the specific processing activity. [ 52 ] According to Article 13(2)(c), the controller must inform the data subject about the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time, when the legal basis for the processing of the personal data was the consent of the data subject. [ 53 ] The same requirement can be found in Article 7(3) GDPR . In addition, Article 7(3) GDPR requires that this information must be given \" prior to consent \". For example: A data subject subscribes to a newsletter and is asked for consent to get emails. The consent request should include a hint that the consent can be withdrawn at any time. The information about the possibility to withdraw consent should also include information about the fact that the withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. [ 54 ] If the legal basis of the specific processing activity is not consent, the controller should not inform about the possibility to withdraw consent in order to avoid making the data subject assume it has this right, when they actually do not have this possibility. [ 55 ] Article 13(2)(d) GDPR provides that the data subject should be informed about the existence of the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority under Article 77 GDPR . The complaint may be filed, inter alia , with the supervisory authority in the Member State of the data subject's habitual residence, place of work or of an alleged infringement of the GDPR. [ 56 ] In order to facilitate the exercise of data subjects rights, the controller might provide contact details of a supervisory authority. And while suggesting that the lead supervisory authority of the controller is (solely) competent, is a common false statement; in cases where the controller is active in various member states it can be sufficient and helpful to provide the lead supervisory authority's contact details. [ 57 ] Article 13(2)(e) GDPR requires that the controller informs the data subject whether the provision of personal data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract, as well as whether the data subject is obliged to provide the personal data, and the possible consequences of failure to provide such data. The aim of the provision is to make it clear to data subjects which elements are (1) purely optional and may not be provided, (2) which may not be provided but may lead to a negative consequence for the data subject and (3) which information is strictly required. [ 58 ] For example: An online shop may require the name and postal address of a customer because it is necessary for the delivery of the order. To clearly identify which fields are \u201crequired\u201d and which are not, the online store adds the common star symbol (*) to the required fields. In case there is a statutory or contractual requirement of the data subject to provide the data, the controller should disclose the specific provision requiring the provision if personal data. [ 59 ] The controller must also inform the data subject about any possible consequences of not providing information - should they exist. In many cases, the consequences may be trivial, but in certain cases there is no legal duty to provide information, but the lack of the relevant information may lead to a negative consequence for the data subject. [ 60 ] For example: For certain job positions or professional qualifications, a controller may be required by law to verify that the applicant does not have any criminal record. There is no legal duty to provide such information, but failure to provide such data may bar the data subject from obtaining that position or qualification. For example: A bank requires certain documentation to grant a loan. Providing certain information (e.g. an ID) is legally required based on various banking regulations. Other information is optional, but would likely lead to a much better credit rate for the customer (e.g. records about securities, income and alike). Finally, some information is merely used to \"improve customer service\", such as filling out a customer service questionnaire by the bank, and is purely optional. The three categories must be clearly communicated to the data subject, to ensure that they make the right choices. Independent of Article 13(2)(e) GDPR, controllers who oblige a data subject to provide personal data when the latter are not required by law or necessary for the performance of a contract may be in breach of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR . Furthermore, controllers that suggest that data which is optional is necessary, may violate the principle of lawfulness, fairness and transparency ( Article 5(1)(a) GDPR ) and may obtain uninformed (therefore invalid) consent. Article 13(2)(f) GDPR requires the controller to inform data subjects about the existence of automated-decision making (including profiling), as referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) GDPR . At least in those cases, the controller has to further provide meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject. For further details on the definition of automated decision-making see Commentary on Article 22 GDPR . For the definition of profiling, see Article 4(4) GDPR . In short, automated decision-making requires three constitutive elements: (1) a decision; (2) taken solely by automated mean (i.e. without any human involved in the decision-making process); (3) which produces legal effects or similarly significant effects on the data subject. For example: A recruiter solely relies on an algorithm to select the best profile, among a pool of candidates for a job offer. The use of such an algorithm will qualify as automated decision-making under the GDPR. As made clear by Article 13(2)(f) GDPR, in the event a controller makes use of automated decision-making, the data subjects must be informed about its existence. More particularly, the controller is under the duty to provide the data subject with \" meaningful information about the logic involved \" and on the \" significance and the envisaged consequences \" of such forms of processing. According to the WP29, \" meaningful \" means that the controller should inform the data subject in simple ways about the rationale behind the automated decision-making including profiling but not necessarily give a \u201d complex explanation of the algorithms used or disclosure of the full algorithm \u201d. Furthermore, \u201c[t] he controller should provide the data subject with general information (notably, on factors taken into account for the decision-making process, and on their respective \u2018weight\u2019 on an aggregate level) \u201d. [ 61 ] The rationale behind this reinforced right to information lies in the complexity of algorithms and machine-learning, which sometimes operate in obscure ways, and may not be perceivable or understandable for data subjects. Given that the purpose of that provision is to ensure that the data subject obtains \" meaningful information \" about the automated decision-making, simply disclosing the code behind the automated decision-making or providing a complex explanation of the algorithms would in principle not be suitable or sufficient. Rather, the controller should highlight the criteria on the basis of which the decision is made, so that the data subject can understand the main reasons behind the decision. In line with Article 12(1) GDPR, such information should be concise yet complete, intelligible, and given in clear and plain language. [ 62 ] Similarly, the CJEU, in connection to Article 15(1)(h) GDPR , held that \"the mere communication of a complex mathematical formula, such as an algorithm, or [...] the detailed description of all the steps in automated decision-making\" would not constitute a sufficiently concise and intelligible explanation and therefore violate Article 12(1) GDPR. [ 63 ] \"\u2018[M]eaningful information about the logic involved\u2019 in automated decision-making [\u2026] covers all relevant information concerning the procedure and principles relating to the use of personal data with a view to obtaining, by automated means, a specific result, the obligation of transparency also requiring that information be provided in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form.\" CJEU - C\u2011203/22 - Dun & Bradstreet Austria , margin number 50 regarding Article 15(1)(h) GDPR. The CJEU also held (regarding Article 15(1)(h) GDPR ) that the purpose of the right is to enable the data subject to exercise the rights listed in Article 22(3) GDPR , namely the right to express their point of view on that decision and to contest it. [ 64 ] The same can be assumed for the corresponding information obligation of the controller. The controller is also required to inform the data subject about the \" significance and envisaged consequences \" of the processing. These two terms, which are likely synonymous, pertain to the decision that is made or prepared based on the data processing. The controller must describe what will be decided upon based on the data processing, what decision-making options are available, and how processing results may impact or potentially lead to certain decisions. [ 65 ] For example: An online shop implements a fraud detection feature which automatically disables the \"buy now, pay later\" option for orders where the billing address is different to the shipment address. The shop provider considers this to constitute lawful automatic decision making under Article 22 GDPR and wants to inform data subjects accordingly. Regarding the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject, it discloses that only the specific order is affected and not future orders by the same customer. Also, customers might have to pay prior to receiving the goods in case they want to diverging addresses. The use of the wording \"[a] t least in those cases \" seems to be the result of political negotiations and causes some confusion. It literally means that the information under Article 13(2)(f) GDPR (logic involved, significance and envisaged consequences) \" may \" also be provided if the automated decision-making or profiling does not meet the requirements set forth in Article 22(1) GDPR. Obviously, a controller \" may \" always provide more information. The reading of the provision as a free choice by the controller would make this element of the law redundant. \"If the automated decision-making and profiling does not meet the Article 22(1) definition it is nevertheless good practice to provide the above information.\" [ https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/items/612053 WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Automated individual decision-making and Profiling for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679', 3 October 2017, p. 25.] However, as the WP29 points out, the \u201c general principle that data subjects should not be taken by surprise by the processing of their personal data, [and that this] equally appl [ies] to profiling generally (not just profiling which is captured by Article 22) \u201d. [ 66 ] Thus, in application of the above general GDPR principles, automated decision-making, including profiling, even if not falling under Article 22(1) or (4) GDPR, should be disclosed and explained to ensure fair and transparent processing. [ 67 ] It should be recalled that Article 5(1)(b) GDPR establishes the principle of purpose limitation according to which personal data must only be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. Usually, the processing of personal data for purposes other than those for which the personal data were initially collected ( further processing ) is only allowed where the new processing operation is compatible with the purposes for which the personal data were initially collected. [ 68 ] See Article 6(4) GDPR for further details on the general lawfulness of further processing. Article 13(3) GDPR requires the controller to inform data subjects in case it decides to process personal data for a novel purpose, independent of the question whether the new purpose is a \" compatible \" purpose or not since also \" compatible \" purposes are new purposes. [ 69 ] More specifically, under this provision, a controller who intends to process personal data for a different purpose, must inform the data subject about the new purpose prior to that further processing . For example: A retailer processes its customer's personal data for the purpose of fulfilling its contract with the customer. However, during the business relationship, the controller decides to transfer the amounts owed by its customer to a bank to receive earlier payment. The controller has to inform its customer about the processing of their personal data for this new purpose before the processing activity is started. The provision does not specify the necessary duration between the information about the further processing and the start of the further processing. However, the period should give the data subject sufficient time to evaluate the lawfulness of the further processing and exercise their data subjects rights. Therefore, the more intrusive the new processing purpose is, the earlier such an information should take place. [ 70 ] Article 13(3) GDPR requires the controller to provide the data subject with information on the envisaged other purpose and with any relevant further information as referred to in Article 13(2) GDPR. In other words, the purpose, as well as all the information mentioned in Article 13(2) GDPR, must be provided to the data subject unless parts of the information do not exist or are not applicable in the specific case. [ 71 ] \"[I]n order to be transparent, fair and accountable, controllers should consider making information available to data subjects in their privacy statement/notice on the compatibility analysis carried out under Article 6.4 where a legal basis other than consent or national/ EU law is relied on for the new processing purpose. (In other words, an explanation as to how the processing for the other purpose(s) is compatible with the original purpose). This is to allow data subjects the opportunity to consider the compatibility of the further processing and the safeguards provided and to decide whether to exercise their rights e.g. the right to restriction of processing or the right to object to processing, amongst others. Where controllers choose not to include such information in a privacy notice/statement, WP29 recommends that they make it clear to data subjects that they can obtain the information on request.\" WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018, margin number 47. Article 13(4) GDPR covers situations where the data subject was already provided with the information, either because the controller has already provided it in the past, or because a third party did it on its behalf (for example, a processor). In that scenario, of course, the controller is exempted from the obligation to provide the same information a second time. However, the principle of accountability requires data controllers to demonstrate and document what information the data subject already has, how and when they received it, and ensure that it is not outdated. Furthermore, even if the data subject has previously been provided with only parts of the information covered by Article 13 GDPR, the data controller still has an obligation to supplement missing information to ensure that the data subject has a complete set of information as listed in Article 13 GDPR. [ 72 ] In order for this exemption to apply, the information the data subject already has, must comply with the formal requirements of Article 12 GDPR; i.e. the information must have been provided in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Otherwise the formal requirements could be circumvented by this exemption. [ 73 ] In certain cases, Article 23 GDPR may be used by the Union or by Member States to exempt controllers in certain situations or sectors from duties under Article 13 GDPR (such as undercover journalism). See Commentary on Article 23 GDPR for more information on exemptions by Union or Member State law. It it important to note that other Articles of the GDPR also include information duties, such as the duty in Article 7(3) to inform about the right to withdraw consent, the duty in Article 21(4) to inform about the right to object or Article 49(1) GDPR , last paragraph on the reliance on the \" compelling legitimate interests \" to transfer personal data to a third country. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 13 GDPR \u2191 Compare WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018, margin number 4 (available here ). \u2191 Compare WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018, margin numner 7 et seqq.

References 1.   Where personal data have not been obtained from the data subject, the controller shall provide the data subject with the following information: 2.   In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall provide the data subject with the following information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the data subject: 3.   The controller shall provide the information referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2: 4.   Where the controller intends to further process the personal data for a purpose other than that for which the personal data were obtained, the controller shall provide the data subject prior to that further processing with information on that other purpose and with any relevant further information as referred to in paragraph 2. 5.   Paragraphs 1 to 4 shall not apply where and insofar as: Together with Article 13 GDPR , Article 14 GDPR provides for the controllers the obligation to inform data subjects about the processing of their personal data. Article 14 is therefore  an expression of the principle of transparency enshrined in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR . Article 14 GDPR has to be read in conjunction with Article 12 GDPR which provides for further rules on transparency and modalities in connection with the provision of information under Article 13 and 14 GDPR, as well as regarding the communication with data subjects in connection to their data subjects rights. While Article 13 GDPR applies in situations where personal data are collected directly from the data subjects (e.g. through the filling out of an electronic form), Article 14 GDPR applies to situations where personal data have not been obtained directly from the data subjects (e.g. submitted from a third party), also referred to as indirect collection . Article 14 GDPR is divided into 5 paragraphs. The first two paragraphs lists elements the controller needs to include in its information to the data subject. [ 1 ] The third paragraph provides for rules regarding the time at which a controller has to fulfill its information obligation. These rules should ensure that the information is provided early enough for the data subject to assess the lawfulness of the processing activity and effectively exercise their rights under the GDPR. [ 2 ] The fourth paragraph defines the obligation to notify the data subject when the controller intends to process the data subject's personal data for a purpose other than the purpose for which the data were originally collected (i.e. further processing). Lastly, the fifth paragraph provides for some exemptions from the information obligation. WP29 and EDPB Guidelines: For this Article, see the following Guidelines: WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018 (available here ); and EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.1) (available here ). Since Article 13 GDPR and Article 14 GDPR are almost identical in content. The original proposal for the GDPR by the European Commission had, for good reasons, treated both situations in one Article. However, in the political process the Article was duplicated and adapted for the two different situations. The Commentary below will mostly refer to the corresponding sections of the Commentary on Article 13 GDPR. Only substantial differences between those two Articles will be discussed below. In practice, information under Article 13 and 14 GDPR are usually provided in a single privacy policy. [ 3 ] There is no requirement to separate the information, as long as the information is provided to the data subject in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form and on time. For example: A clothing retailer makes it possible to buy clothing online and pay later. It collects the necessary information from customers using an online form on its website. The retailer also manually collects data of potential customers from the insolvency register in order to decide if an order by a customer should be declined due to an ongoing insolvency. Since the retailer collects personal data directly from the data subject as well as from a public register, it has an information obligation under Article 13 and 14 GDPR. The operator decides to include information about both processing activities in one joint privacy policy and brings this privacy policy to the data subject\u2019s attention at the time of the data collection. Similarly to the information provided under Article 13 GDPR , the controller needs to actively furnish the information to the data subject; simply making the information available (e.g. on the controller's website) is insufficient, rather, the data subject must be actively informed. [ 4 ] See also Commentary on Article 13 GDPR for more information. A data is not obtained directly from the data subject when the latter is not involved in the controller's collection operations; in other words, in case the data subject is not the immediate origin of the data collected by the controller. [ 5 ] This includes situations where controllers collect data that is generally available (\"open source information\"), information from external data providers, various business partners, information provided by other natural persons (on various platforms), information generated by the controller itself and alike. [ 6 ] This also includes situations where multiple controllers work together, such as an online shop which provides personal data to the payment service provider and the delivery service,  and all receive personal data, without obtaining it directly from the data subject. \"[I]t must be observed that the material scope of Article 14 of the GDPR is defined negatively by reference to Article 13 of that regulation. As is apparent from those provisions\u2019 headings themselves, Article 13 concerns the information to be provided where personal data are collected from the data subject, while Article 14 concerns the information which must be provided where personal data have not been collected from the data subject. In the light of that dichotomy, all situations in which data are not collected from the data subject fall within the material scope of Article 14. Therefore, it follows from the combined interpretation of Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR that both personal data obtained by the controller from a person other than the data subject, and data generated by the controller itself \u2013 which, on account of their nature, have also not been obtained from the data subject \u2013 fall within the scope of Article 14.\" CJEU - C-169/23 - M\u00e1sdi , margin number 48 et seq. \"In the light of the wording of Article 14(2)(f) of the GDPR, read in the light of recital 61 of that regulation, it must be held that only the source of the personal data collected is the relevant criterion for the purposes of determining the respective scopes of Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR. Under Article 14(2)(f), where the data have not been obtained from the data subject, the controller must inform the data subject of the source of the personal data.\" CJEU - Case C-422/24 - AB Storstockholms Lokaltrafik , margin number 35. Given the identical wording, see commentary on Article 13(1)(a) GDPR . Given the identical wording, see commentary on Article 13(1)(b) GDPR . Given the identical wording, see commentary on Article 13(1)(c) GDPR . In an Article 14 scenario, the legislator found it necessary to also provide a list of the categories of personal data that were obtained, because the data controller has obtained the personal data from a source other than the data subject, who is therefore usually unaware of the specific categories of personal data that have been obtained. The rationale behind that provision is to allow the data subjects to contextualise the processing and better understand its material scope. When data are directly collected from the data subjects, as envisaged in Article 13 GDPR , the latter normally already know which data are being processed since they provided them to the controller (for example, by filling an online form, agreeing to cookies usage, etc). By contrast, when the controller obtains the data from a third party, as envisaged in Article 14 GDPR, the data subjects may not be aware of which personal data are being processed, hence the importance of providing this additional piece of information to them is to avoid a lack in transparency. [ 7 ] The term \" category \" is not defined in the GDPR. The enumeration of \" special categories \" of personal data in Article 9 GDPR (e.g. data relating to health, political opinions, ethnic origin, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, etc.) does not serve as a definition, just because the same word is used. Simply referring to \"health data\" as a category would be too broad to comply with the transparency obligations under Article 5(1)(a) and 12(1) GDPR , given that it may cover one simple information, such as the weight of the data subject, or on the contrary \" a myriad of information \", [ 8 ] such as the weight, height, heart rate, blood pressure, HIV status, cancer treatments and much more. In any case, the controller should be specific enough to meet the requirements of Article 5(1)(a) and 12(1) GDPR , to comply with the principle of fairness and transparency, while presenting such information in a concise and intelligible form. The level of required detail is rather unclear, but in practice controllers often draft a table of data fields (e.g. name, address, email) and group them into detailed enough categories (like \"name\" and \"contact details\"). The level of detail provided to the data subject should enable them to assess the lawfulness of the use of the data and whether the data is indeed necessary for the purposes of the data processing. [ 9 ] Similarly, the data subject should be in a position to assess the risk the processing of their data entails. [ 10 ] Therefore, the information should be more granular in case of more intrusive processing activities. In such a case the requirements of Article 12 GDPR should be considered, just as it should be considered that this information is clearly available to the controller. However, it should also be pointed out that the data subject can always exercise its right of access under Article 15 GDPR which requires the controller to provide the specific processed data and not just data categories. For example: A data broker collects information about data subjects from various sources, including cookie data, IP addresses, user IDs from various platforms and email addresses. It is not transparent to only state that the controller collects \"data about online behaviour\". It would be \"appropriate\" within the meaning of Article 12(1) GDPR to list the ten or twenty data types that are collected, given that this amounts to no relevant effort by the controller and would ensure full transparency, as well as using clear and plain language. Given the identical wording, see commentary on Article 13(1)(e) GDPR . Given the identical wording, see commentary on Article 13(1)(f) GDPR . Just as paragraph 1, paragraph 2 of Article 14 GDPR provides for the specific elements the controller has to include in the information of the data subject. There is no difference, if the information is required in Article 14(1) or Article 14(2) GDPR and the controller has to comply with both provisions equally. See Commentary on the relationship of Article 13(1) and Article 13(2) GDPR . Given the identical wording, see commentary on Article 13(2)(a) GDPR . Given the identical wording, see commentary on Article 13(1)(d) GDPR . Given the identical wording, see commentary on Article 13(2)(b) GDPR . Given the identical wording, see commentary on Article 13(2)(c) GDPR . Given the identical wording, see commentary on Article 13(2)(d) GDPR . In case of indirect collection of personal data, Article 14(2)(f) GDPR requires the controller to inform the data subjects about the source of such data. A source may be another entity or party, but also includes a technical source (like open sources, sensors, CCTV or online tracking tools). [ 11 ] If the data have been obtained from a publicly accessible source, the controller must indicate this fact (for instance, online newspapers, social networks, other publicly accessible sources). In most cases, however, controllers may obtain personal data from third parties, for example from data brokers, affiliates, business partners or other controllers. [ 12 ] This should help the data subjects to exercise their rights against not only the controller providing the information under Article 14 GDPR, but also by the controller which is the source of the data. [ 13 ] To comply with data protection principles, such as data protection by design and by default, it is important to incorporate transparency mechanisms into processing systems during the system's design and implementation phase. By doing so, organisations can effectively track and trace all personal data sources that are received into their systems throughout the data processing life cycle, enabling them to be fully transparent about their data handling practices. [ 14 ] A controller should therefore be capable to provide data subjects with information about the sources of their data, even in cases numerous sources were used. Consequently, controllers should provide the data subjects with the specific source of their data. Only if this is practically impossible, the controller might simply provide general information about the source of the information. [ 15 ] Given the identical wording, see commentary on Article 13(2)(f) GDPR . Another difference between Article 13 and 14 GDPR concerns the time at which the information must be provided to the data subjects. While Article 13(1) GDPR requires the information of the data subject at the time the data is obtained by the controller, Article 14(3) GDPR provides for three different scenarios, each having their own time limit. The tree requirements apply in parallel. Whichever deadline lapses first, will trigger the requirement to provide the information. Obviously these are just the last moments when information has to be provided, a controller can always provide information at an earlier, maybe more convenient moment. [ 16 ] \"Accountability requires controllers to demonstrate the rationale for their decision and justify why the information was provided at the time it was. In practice, it may be difficult to meet these requirements when providing information at the \u2018last moment\u2019.\" WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018, margin number 28. \"[B]y requiring that the information referred to in Article 13 of the GDPR be disclosed to the data subject at the time it is obtained, that article gives specific expression to the right of that person to be informed. By contrast, Article 14 of that regulation was adopted in order to respond to situations in which the controller is not in direct contact with the data subject, but collects the personal data from another source, with the result that the disclosure of the information referred to in that provision at the time when that information is obtained is, in practice, made difficult or even impossible. The indirect nature of such collection therefore justifies the latter provision providing for the possibility of deferring the controller\u2019s obligation to provide information.\" CJEU - Case C-422/24 - AB Storstockholms Lokaltrafik , margin number 39. Article 14(3) GDPR introduces a general rule, according to which controllers must provide the mandatory information to data subjects \" within a reasonable period after obtaining the personal data \", and at the latest within a month from the day of the indirect collection. The maximum period of one month is also applicable in any case, i.e. the controller cannot invoke one of the deadlines stipulated in Article 14(3)(b) or Article 14(3)(c) GDPR in order to prolong the deadline to more than a month. [ 17 ] For the assessment of a reasonable period , the provision demands that the specific circumstances must be regarded. For such an assessment the controller should consider its possibilities to inform the data subject as well as the data subject's interests in receiving the information, and at which time the information is needed by the data subject in order to effectively exercise its rights under the GDPR. [ 18 ] Article 14(3)(b) GDPR states that if the indirectly obtained personal data are to be used for communication with the data subject, then the controller must provide all mandatory information under Article 14 GDPR \"at the latest at the time of the first communication to that data subject .\" [ 19 ] However, if the contact is not made within the first month of the collection of the data the general rule established under Article 14(3)(a) GDPR applies instead (i.e. time limit of one-month as a maximum). [ 20 ] For example: A recruitment agency collects publicly available personal data from various platforms such as LinkedIn or Xing in order to contact specific profiles about new career opportunities. The recruitment agency must add a privacy notice containing all information listed in Article 14(2) and (3) in the first email or message sent to these data subjects. However, if the recruitment agency delays this first communication beyond one month, the information must in any case be provided within the general applicable one-month time limit. Article 14(3)(c) GDPR states that if the personal data are to be disclosed to another recipient, then the controller must provide all mandatory information under Article 14 GDPR \" at the latest when the personal data are first disclosed \". If the disclosure is not made within the first month of the collection of the data, however, the general rule established under Article 14(3)(a) GDPR should apply instead (i.e. time limit one-month as a maximum). [ 20 ] Given the identical wording, see commentary on Article 13(3) GDPR . According to Article 14(5) GDPR, the first four paragraphs of the provision do not apply if one of the following conditions is met: (a) the data subject is already informed; (b) providing the information is impossible or requires disproportionate effort; (c) the collection or disclosure of the data is required by an EU or Member State law; and finally, (d) in case the data must remain confidential due to professional secrecy. Controllers may not abusively rely on these exemptions which must be interpreted restrictively and applied narrowly. [ 21 ] Given the identical wording, see commentary on Article 13(4) GDPR . Under Article 14(5)(b), the controller does not have to comply with the obligation to provide the information outlined in Articles 14(1), 14(2), and 14(4) GDPR [ 22 ] when this (i) proves impossible, or (ii) involves a disproportionate effort (in particular, for archival, scientific, historical research, or statistical purposes), or (iii) is likely to seriously impair the objectives of the processing. In all such cases, appropriate measures must be adopted to protect the data subject\u2019s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, which would at least require the publication of the information (Article 14(5)(b) GDPR). Under Article 14(5)(b) GDPR the scenario in which providing information is deemed \" impossible \" is a binary one, as something is either possible or impossible with no gradations in between. Therefore, if a data controller intends to use this exemption, it must explain the specific factors that make it impossible to providing the relevant information to the data subject. Furthermore, if these factors cease to exist after a certain time, and it becomes feasible to provide the information to the data subjects, the data controller should promptly do so. In reality, there will be very few instances where a data controller can establish that it is genuinely impossible to supply information to data subjects. [ 23 ] If partial elements cannot be provided, the controller must still provide as much information as possible. For example, if the specific source cannot be named, then the controller should at least provide general information regarding the source(s), [ 24 ] such as their nature (i.e. public or private) or the types of organization, industry or sector concerned (e.g. national register of companies). [ 25 ] The exemption under Article 14(5)(b) GDPR also applies in case the provision of the information involves a disproportionate effort. In order to invoke this exemption, the controller must demonstrate that the provision of information to the data subjects would involve a disproportionate effort, notably because of the number of data subjects or the age of the data (Recital 62). Where a data controller seeks to rely on this exception, it should carry out a balancing test, which weighs, on the one side, the potential effort to be made and, on the other, the effects that the absence of information could have on the data subjects. [ 26 ] It is rather common that controllers arrive at a negative outcome in this balancing test, which would deprive Article 14 GDPR of any practical meaning. The mere fact that a controller processes information about large numbers of data subjects can for example not be a reason to see a \" disproportionate effort \". Otherwise larger controllers would almost always be freed of the duties under Article 14 GDPR, which would make secret collection of personal data the norm - not the exception. For example: An address broker has - by definition - the addresses of most persons in its database. Just the mere fact that it holds information about almost ever resident of a given country, does not mean that informing data subjects that their addresses are collected, stored and sold to third parties would always be \"disproportionate\". \" Archival, scientific, historical research or statistical purposes \" are named as typical examples where this condition may be met. Archives would often have to dig through millions of documents and inform everyone named or national statistics offices would have to inform every resident. In the drafting process of the GDPR, these purposes were also a common ground for various privileges (see Article 5(1)(b) GDPR or Article 89 GDPR ). However, these purposes are not exempt per se, but must still undertake a balancing test - just with a hint from the legislator that they are more likely to arrive at a result that points at not informing people directly. [ 27 ] For example: A pharmaceutical company gets patient data to conduct further research. If the pharmaceutical company has the electronic contract details of patients or it only concerns a reasonably small group it would usually not be \"disproportionate\" to inform them. If the assessment of the \" balancing test \" is negative, this assessment must be documented and must result in the implementation of appropriate measures (see below). Article 14(5)(b) GDPR covers a final scenario where a data controller's disclosure of information to a data subject in accordance with Article 14(1) GDPR could potentially hinder or make it impossible to achieve the intended processing objectives. To utilize this exception, data controllers must demonstrate that providing the information stated in Article 14(1) GDPR on its own would render the processing objectives null and void or seriously impair them. It's important to note that this particular aspect of Article 14(5)(b) assumes that the data processing conforms to all of the principles outlined in Article 5 GDPR, particularly that the processing of personal data is fair and has a legal basis under all circumstances. [ 28 ] This exemption may apply to situations where confidentiality is necessary to protect the investigation and ensure its success. For example: A private detective is hired to investigate suspected misconduct by a person. If the investigation is based on strong enough suspicions, the detective is not required to provide the person with information under Article 14(5)(b) until the investigation is completed, even if it takes longer than the one-month deadline outlined in Article 14(3)(a) GDPR. However, the detective must provide the information to the person at the latest at the end of the investigation, as required by Article 14(3)(b) GDPR. [ 29 ] In case the controller relies on any of the exceptions outlined in Article 14(5)(b) GDPR, it is required to implement appropriate measures that safeguard the data subject's rights, freedoms and legitimate interests. These measures are aimed at compensating for the lack of transparency that results from not providing information. A controller can do this in a number of ways, but the law requires to at least publish the information (e.g. by putting the information on its website, or by proactively advertising the information or by posting information on its premises). Read in the light of Article 12(1) GDPR , these efforts must reasonably reach the relevant data subjects - taking into account that a data subject does not know about the processing and will therefore not seek the information. Other appropriate measures, in addition to making the information publicly available, will depend on the circumstances of the processing. [ 30 ] \"Other appropriate measures, in addition to making the information publicly available, will depend on the circumstances of the processing, but may include: undertaking a data protection impact assessment; applying pseudonymisation techniques to the data; minimising the data collected and the storage period; and implementing technical and organisational measures to ensure a high level of security.\" uropa.eu/system/files/2023-09/wp260rev01_en.pdf WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018, margin number 64. Article 14(5)(c) GDPR permits the data controller to omit the information required under  Article 14(1) to (4) GDPR when obtaining or disclosing personal data is explicitly mandated by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject. However, this exemption is subject to certain conditions. Firstly, the law in question must provide adequate measures to protect the data subject's legitimate interests. This means that the level of protection of the data subject has to be at least equivalent to that guaranteed by the controller's information obligation under Article 14(1) to (4) GDPR . Therefore the Union or Member State law should specifically mention the source from which data subjects will obtain information about the processing of their personal data. [ 31 ] Secondly, the law should specifically address the data controller, and the obtaining or disclosure in question should be mandatory for the data controller, not optional. \"[\u2026] the ratio legis of that exception is that the obligation to provide information to the data subject imposed by Article 14(1), (2) and (4) of that regulation is not justified when another provision of EU law or of Member State law imposes on the controller a sufficiently comprehensive and binding obligation to provide to the data subject information relating to obtaining or disclosure of personal data. In the situation covered by Article 14(5)(c), data subjects must have sufficient knowledge of the detailed rules and the purposes of obtaining or disclosing those data.\" CJEU - C-169/23 - M\u00e1sdi , margin number 44. The data controller must demonstrate how the law applies to them and requires them to obtain or disclose the personal data. While it is the responsibility of Union or Member State law to provide appropriate measures to protect the data subject's interests, the controller must ensure that its obtaining or disclosing of personal data complies with those measures and should inform data subjects that it is doing so in accordance with the law, unless there's a legal prohibition preventing them from doing so. [ 32 ] Finally, Member States may legislate, in line with Article 23 GDPR, for additional specific restrictions to the right to transparency under Article 12 and to information under Articles 13 and 14 GDPR. [ 33 ] For example: An employer is required to report the salaries of all employees to the tax authority under national law. The personal data is not obtained from the data subjects and therefore the tax authority is subject to the requirements of Article 14 GDPR . As the obtaining of the personal data by the tax authority from employers is expressly laid down by law, the information requirements in Article 14 GDPR do not apply to the tax authority in this instance. However, the employer must still name the authority as a recipient under Article 13(1)(e) GDPR . Article 14(5)(d) GDPR provides an exemption from the information requirement for data controllers when personal data must remain confidential under a professional secrecy obligation regulated by Union or Member State law, including statutory obligations of secrecy. This is especially relevant for certain sectors, like the health care sector or the the legal sector. If a data controller wishes to rely on this exemption, they must demonstrate that they have correctly identified the exemption and explain how the professional secrecy obligation specifically pertains to the data controller in such a way that it prohibits them from providing all of the information outlined in Articles 14(1), 14(2), and 14(4) GDPR to the data subject. [ 34 ] \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 14 GDPR \u2191 Just as it is the case for Article 13 GDPR, the division of the information requirements in two separate paragraphs does not limit or reduce the effect of the obligation in any of the two paragraphs in Article 14 GDPR, see Commentary on Article 13(2) GDPR for more details. \u2191 WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018, margin number 28 (available here ); see also Recital 39 GDPR. \u2191 In particular in case a controller collects information directly from the data subject as well as receives information from other sources and is therefore subject to both, Article 13 and  Article 14 GDPR. \u2191 WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018, margin number 33 (available here ). \u2191 In practice, it can be rather unclear if personal data were collected from the data subject or not; see B\u00e4cker , in K\u00fchling, Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 13 GDPR, margin numbers 13 et seqq.

Take for instance Article 13 e-Privacy Directive, according to which, automated calling and communication systems (e.g. automatic calling machines), fax machines, or electronic mail can only be used for direct marketing purposes if the subscribers or users have given prior consent. \u2191 20.0 20.1 WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018, margin number 27 (available here ). \u2191 WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018, margin number 57 (available here ). \u2191 On the point, let's clarify that the WP29 seems to narrow the scope of exceptions to paragraphs 14(1), 14(2), and 14(4) GDPR, excluding paragraph 14(3) GDPR regarding the timing of information. This hermeneutic choice is not entirely convincing. The wording of the provision states that \"[p]aragraphs 1 to 4 shall not apply,\" including paragraph (3). Therefore, we can conclude that in the presence of an exclusion clause, even paragraph 4 would apply.

The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and the following information: 2.   Where personal data are transferred to a third country or to an international organisation, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46 relating to the transfer. 3.   The controller shall provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing. For any further copies requested by the data subject, the controller may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs. Where the data subject makes the request by electronic means, and unless otherwise requested by the data subject, the information shall be provided in a commonly used electronic form. 4.   The right to obtain a copy referred to in paragraph 3 shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. Article 15 GDPR provides for the data subject's right to request access to their data from the controller. The right to access is also explicitly named as a fundamental right in Article 8(2) CFR ; therefore, it is important that it is interpreted in the light of the Charter and the principle of proportionality in Article 52(1) CFR . [ 1 ] Just like the general principle of transparency in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and the controller's information obligations under Article 13 and 14 GDPR as well as the other transparency provisions, the right to access is meant to overcome \"informational imbalance\" (i.e. the fact that the controller has much more knowledge about the processing of the data subject's data than the data subject themself). Similarly, the right of access is supposed to enable data subjects to assess the lawfulness of the processing of their data and to effectively exercise their rights under the GDPR. [ 2 ] The data subjects' right to request access to their data constitutes a passive obligation to the controller that must only be granted if a data subject makes a respective request. [ 3 ] While the controller's information obligations under Articles 13 and 14 GDPR provide for a more generic ex-ante information, Article 15 GDPR is meant to provide the data subject with more detailed and specific information on an ex-post basis. [ 4 ] In other words: the right to information under Articles 13 and 14 GDPR provide a (generic) forward-looking information of expected or possible processing - usually in a uniform way for all users of the service, which must be provided proactively by the controller. The right to information is therefore naturally more generic and less precise. The right to access however, allows the data subject to get information on the actual processing of its specific personal data and its specific situation, which does not only enable the data subject to exercise its  rights (see especially Articles 16 to 22 GDPR) but also allows to check if the controller has complied with the ex-ante information provided under Articles 13 or 14 GDPR . [ 5 ] Pursuant to Article 12(2) GDPR, the response by the controller on those rights shall be individually tailored to the case of the data subject and relate to the processing operations concerned. Information on rights that are not applicable for the data subject in the specific situation should be avoided EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.1), margin number 119. While the wording of Articles 13 or 14 GDPR and Article 15(1) GDPR often overlaps, the controller has a different obligation under Article 15 GDPR; to include the ex-post information about concrete, actual processing. If the information under Articles 13 or 14 GDPR and Article 15 GDPR would be the same information, Article 15(1) GDPR would be largely deprived of any meaning. A mere reference to the information under Articles 13 or 14 GDPR would therefore not be sufficient. For example: A large platform lists all possible processing operations, purposes and recipients. Many of these elements are only relevant for users that use certain functions of the platform. If the controller responds to an access request under Article 15 GDPR, just referring to the privacy policy for information under Article 15(1) GDPR would neither be transparent nor accurate. It would not allow the data subject to understand if its personal data was actually used for certain purposes or shared with third parties. The possibility to receive consistent, reliable, complete and updated information regarding processing activities allows individuals to obtain and increase their awareness of any relevant processing operations, exercise practical control over their data, and scrutinise the accuracy and lawfulness of data processing operations. [ 6 ] The right to access is therefore a prerequisite to exercising data subjects' rights (rectification, erasure, restriction, etc.) and is a key principle of the entire data protection framework. [ 7 ] The right to access is however also a \"stand-alone\" fundamental right, protected under Article 8(2) CFR . A data subject may just want to get information about the data processed about them- independent of the exercise of any other right under the GDPR. A data subject therefore does not need to give reasons for exercising the right to access. Even if they did, the controller does not have the jurisdiction to assess underpinning motives. [ 8 ] \"[C]ontrollers should not assess \u201cwhy\u201d the data subject is requesting access, but only \u201cwhat\u201d the data subject is requesting (see section 3 on the analysis of the request) and whether they hold personal data relating to that individual (see section 4). Therefore, for example, the controller should not deny access on the grounds or the suspicion that the requested data could be used by the data subject to defend themselves in court in the event of a dismissal or a commercial dispute with the controller.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.1), margin number 13. Also, the CJEU held that the motive of the data subject is irrelevant when requesting access to their personal data processed by the controller. In C\u2011307/22 FT and DW a data subject used Article 15 GDPR to get (free) access to its own health records. The controller alleged that the access request was not made for the purpose of exercising (other) GDPR rights, but to get a copy of health records, which is usually subject to a charge. The CJEU held that the right to get a free copy of ones personal data is independent of the intent purpose for which the personal data is used and the controller must grant access. [ 9 ] \"Article 12(5) and Article 15(1) and (3) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the controller is under an obligation to provide the data subject, free of charge, with a first copy of his or her personal data undergoing processing, even where the reason for that request is not related to those referred to in the first sentence of recital 63 of that regulation.\" [ [1] ], margin number 52. For example: A film maker made an access request to CCTV footage showing her walk around London. She had other actors be in front of the CCTV cameras and used the footage to make an entire movie from CCTV footage collected via the right to access. Tilda Swinton narrated the otherwise silent CCTV footage published in 2007. [ 10 ] Her use of the right to access to get a copy of CCTV footage may have been tedious, but the use of personal data for a movie (criticising surveillance) was maybe exceptional but legal. Consequently, a data subject can also make an access request under Article 15 GDPR for any  other purpose - such as to generate evidence for a legal procedure. Even if many EU Member States' procedures do not know the concept of \"discovery\" (as common in the US), data subjects may use the right to access for any purpose they wish. In fact, the controller may equally rely on personal data as evidence under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR . The use of Article 15 GDPR to obtain evidence would still be used to overcome \"informational imbalance\" in such cases. [ 11 ] Other EU or national legislation may provide for additional rights to access information. Such rights may come in many forms, such as procedural law (allowing access to documents in a procedure), freedom of information laws (allowing access to government files) or specific sectoral laws, such as laws concerning access to health data or archives. Unless other EU or national law is explicitly a lex specialis in relation to the GDPR - usually in the form of a Restriction under Article 23 GDPR - these other rights exist in parallel to the GDPR. This means a data subject may freely choose to rely on Article 15 GDPR or any other legal basis available to it. [ 12 ] WP29 and EDPB Guidelines : For this Article, see the following Guidelines: WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018 (available here ); and EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.1) (available here ). Article 15(1) GDPR describes the core of the data subject's right of access. It provides for the controller the obligation to (i) confirms whether or not personal data of the data subject are processed, and, if that is the case, (ii) provide access to the personal data (in other words, a copy of the personal data \"undergoing processing\" under Article 15(3) GDPR or other relevant method to achieve the purpose), and (iii) inform the data subject about certain elements of the processing (Article 15(1)(a-h) and 15(2) GDPR). Therefore, once the access request is received, the controller must first verify whether processing of the data subject's personal data is actually taking place and if so, provide the required information to the data subject. When providing any of this information to the requesting data subject, the controller has to comply with the formal requirements set forth in Article 12 GDPR , in particularly, the information must be provided in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. In this regard, it is particularly important, that the information provided by the controller is complete. [ 13 ] It should be pointed out that, as made clear in Recital 60 GDPR, the controller should provide data subjects with any further information if it is necessary to ensure a fair and transparent processing. For example, the EDPB pointed out that a controller should provide data subjects with information about the legal basis for the processing or at least point out where this information can be found when responding to an access request. [ 14 ] The data subject has a right to obtain (i.e. request) information. Typically the right to access under Article 15 GDPR is triggered by an access request by the data subject. The GDPR does not impose any requirements regarding the form of the request by which the data subject or their authorised representative exercises the right of access. [ 15 ] The data subject may define the scope of their request and the format of the request. In other words, the data subject may make a general request, including all the elements just mentioned, or limit the scope of the inquiry, e.g. by requesting only a copy of its data or only some elements of the list in Article 15(1)(a-h) GDPR. \"Any limitation of the scope of a request to a specific provision of Art. 15 GDPR, made by the data subjects, must be clear and unambiguous. For example, if the data subjects require verbatim \u201cinformation about the data processed in relation to them\u201d, the controller should assume that the data subjects intend to exercise their full right under Art. 15(1) \u2013 (2) GDPR. Such a request should not be interpreted as meaning that the data subjects wish to receive only the categories of personal data that are being processed and to waive their right to receive the information listed in Art. 15(1)(a) to (h).\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.1), margin number 51. Given that the controller must facilitate a request under Article 12(2) GDPR and most data subjects will have limited knowledge about the right to access, the controller may not take an overly formalistic approach to a request. The data subject must not explicitly rely on Article 15 GDPR, but may use laymen's terms to make a valid request. The request must not specify specific personal data or a specific reason for the exercise of the right to access. If the request is unclear, the controller shall ask the data subject to specify what processing activities the request relates to or for further information to identify the relevant data. [ 16 ] The data subject has the right to make \"blanket\" requests for any personal data held about him or her. The controller may suggest a limitation - also in the interest of a prompt response - but if the data subject nonetheless requests access to all their personal data, the controller has to provide this information, [ 17 ] as confirmed by the EDPB [ 18 ] and national courts. [ 19 ] For example: On all help pages of a controller that deal with the right to access, data subjects are referred to an online form to \"request a copy\". If the form is filled out, the data subject gets a ZIP file with some, but not all, personal data. Other information under Article 15(1) and (2) GDPR is not provided at all. During the complaints procedure the controller argues that the data subject only made a \"request for a copy\" not a \"request under Article 15 GDPR\". The controller clearly violated Article 5(1)(a) and 12(1) GDPR. The addressee of the obligation to provide access is the controller within the meaning of Article 4(7) GDPR , namely the entity which determines the purposes and means of the processing. However, the object of an access request may include processing activities performed by a processor on behalf of the controller. In this case, the duty to respond to the access request stays with the controller. [ 20 ] The initial step for data subjects when requesting access to their personal data is to determine whether or not the controller processes any data concerning them. The search for personal data should be performed on all the paper and computer records where personal data are being processed, including the controller's back-up systems. If the controller does process data related to the requesting data subject, it confirms the existence of processing operations, but the controller should respond even if no personal data are processed. [ 21 ] \"Where the controller does not process personal data relating to the data subject requesting the access, the information to be provided would be limited to confirming that no personal data relating to the data subject are being processed. Where the controller does process data relating to the requesting person, the controller must confirm this fact to this person. This confirmation may be communicated separately, or it may be encompassed as part of the information on the personal data being processed \" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.1), margin number 18. In general terms, \" access \" refers to the set of actions that a controller takes to show the data subject the data undergoing processing. The right to access is meant to give access to the personal data itself, not a description of the processing. [ 22 ] Generally, access to the personal data is granted by providing a copy of the personal data under Article 15(3) GDPR to the data subject. [ 23 ] \"[T]he notion of a copy has to be interpreted in a broad sense and includes the different kinds of access to personal data as long as it is complete (i.e. it includes all personal data requested) and possible for the data subject to keep. Thus, the requirement to provide a copy means, that the information on the personal data concerning the person who makes the request is provided to the data subject in a way which allows the data subject to retain all of the information and to come back to it.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.1), margin number 25. Under certain circumstances, it may be more adequate to offer alternative methods of data access instead of providing a copy. These temporary access modes may include verbal communication, file inspection, or remote/on-site access that allow to see the personal data in a user interface. Such methods may be appropriate in situations where the data subject's interests are at stake or if they specifically request it. On-site access could also serve as an initial step when a large volume of non-digital data is being processed, enabling the data subject to understand which personal data is being processed and make an informed decision regarding which data they want to obtain through a copy. [ 24 ] \"Non-permanent ways of access can be sufficient and adequate in certain situations; for example, it can satisfy the need of the data subjects to verify that the data processed by the controller are correct by giving data subjects a chance to view the original data. A controller is not obliged to provide the information through other ways than providing a copy but should take a reasonable approach when considering such a request. Giving access through other ways than providing a copy does not preclude the data subjects from the right to also have a copy, unless they choose not to.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.1), margin number 133. The scope of the right to access includes all \"personal data\" as defined in Article 4(1) GDPR and includes all information in relation to a data subject, no matter in which system, format or way the personal data is processed. It also covers information that is stored in other means than automated means, if the personal data is stored or intended to be stored in a \"filing system\" within the meaning of Article 4(6) GDPR . See also Article 2(1) GDPR on the scope of the GDPR when it comes to non-automated filing systems. [ 25 ] For example: A hospital keeps paper records in a paper filing system. The right to access applies here as well. This also includes document that were not yet filed, but are intended to be filed in the paper filing system. However, a sticky note on the desk of the doctor that is not intended to end up in the filing would not be covered. According to the EDPB, this includes, inter alia, special categories of personal data (Article 9 GDPR); personal data relating to criminal convictions and offenses (Article 10 GDPR); data knowingly and actively provided by the data subject (e.g. account data submitted via forms, answers to a questionnaire); observed data or raw data provided by the data subject by virtue of their use of the service or device (e.g. data processed by connected objects, transactional history, activity logs such as access logs, browsing history, search activities, location data, clicking activity, unique aspects of a person\u2019s behaviour such as handwriting, keystrokes, or particular way of walking and speaking); data derived from other data, rather than directly provided by the data subject (e.g. credit score, classification based on common attributes of data subjects; country of residence derived from postcode); data inferred from other data, rather than directly provided by the data subject (e.g. to assign a credit score or comply with anti-money laundering rules, algorithmic results, results of a health assessment or a personalisation or recommendation process). [ 26 ] Equally, data that relates to multiple persons (e.g. the fact that a data subject is on a list of \"high performers\") also relates to the individual person. [ 27 ] To be included in the copy, the data must be undergoing processing. Deleted data or data that was anonymised does not constitute personal data anymore and does not fall under Article 15(1) GDPR. However, there is no exception for archived personal data, data in a \"trash\" folder, pseudonymised personal data or is otherwise hard to retrieve. [ 28 ] In fact, also some \"meta\" information that must be provided under Article 15(1) GDPR, such as the recipients or sources of personal data, may itself constitute \"personal data\". For example, the information that a certain data subject's information was transferred to another entity is regularly stored in the form of \" personal data \" (i.e. information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person) by the controller. The data subject may rely on either provision and may access the information as \" personal data \" or as \" information \" under Article 15(1) GDPR. The right to access covers information at the time the request is made. [ 29 ] This means that a controller must be able to freeze or copy personal data quickly, if a system may delete information during the period it takes to respond to an access request. The controller may not delete information to avoid an accurate response. [ 30 ] As a matter of transparency, controllers should add any additional information that may have been added in the time between the receipt of the access request and the provision of a response to the data subject. For example: A controller deletes all personal data within 7 days to comply with the principle of storage limitation in Article 5(1)(e) GDPR. The controller must be able to copy the data within that time and cannot simply have the automatic deletion frustrate the right to access. In some cases, the requirement to give access before information is deleted (e.g. when CCTV footage is only stored for 48h) can be challenging for a controller. In such a case, the controller should implement measures that ensures its capabilities timely prevent the deletion of data covered by an access request. The data subject must provide the necessary information to ensure identification (see Article 12(2) GDPR ) of the personal data and authentication of the request (see Article 12(6) GDPR ). Before providing access, the controller must take all necessary steps to verify the identity of the data subject to comply with its obligations under Articles 32 GDPR . Obviously the risk of abuse of the right to access is more relevant than exercising the right to object to direct marketing in Article 21(2) GDPR. Consequently, the controller may have to take a stricter approach under Article 15 GDPR. The disclosure of personal data to a different person would usually qualify as a data breach under Article 34 GDPR . [ 31 ] However, the controller shall not use this requirement to hinder the exercise of the right of access. [ 32 ] A controller must strike a balance between adequate security under Article 32 GDPR and not requesting disproportionate information from data subjects, given that they must facilitate the exercise of such right within the meaning of Article 12(2) GDPR and  may not violate the data minimisation principle, when requested identification or authentication (e.g. a copy of an ID) is not necessary. [ 33 ] For example: When the data subject used an email address to create an account on an online-platform and uses the same email address to request access to their data processed by that online platform in connection to their account, the controller can usually have no reasonable doubt as to their identity. The request of an ID by the data subject would be a violation of the controller\u2019s obligation to facilitate the data subject\u2019s right of access. See more information under Article 12(6) GDPR . Under Article 15(1)(a) to (h) GDPR, the controller is obliged to provide the data subject certain information about the processing. In accordance with Article 12 GDPR , this information must be provided in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Most of the information elements in Article 15(1)(a) to (h) are similar but not identical to Article 13 and 14 GDPR. E.g. under Article 13 GDPR , the controller must provide a description of what he intends to do after obtaining the user data: (c) purposes of the processing for which personal data are intended ; (e) recipients or categories of recipients, if any ; (f) the fact that the controller intends to transfer personal data; (2)(e) possible consequences of failure to provide such data. The wording of Article 15 is significantly different because it no longer refers to the controller's future intentions, but to what the controller actually currently does with the previously received data: (1)(a) purpose of the processing (not intended purposes); (1)(b) categories of personal data concerned (not, if any ); (1)(c) recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been disclosed or will be disclosed . These are two different perspectives. Articles 13 and 14 give an indication of what is going to happen, while Article 15 provides a specific indication of what is currently happening with the personal data. But controllers should avoid referencing to the ex-ante information in those Articles. While in some cases the ex-ante information overlaps with the ex-post information exactly, [ 34 ] in most cases, factually correct information under Article 15(1)(a) to (h) GDPR requires a tailored response. Overall, the controller ensures that the information is factually accurate and up-to-date with respect to the data subject's request. [ 35 ] \"In the context of an access request under Art. 15, any information on the processing available to the controller may therefore have to be updated and tailored for the processing operations actually carried out with regard to the data subject making the request. Thus, referring to the wording of its privacy policy would not be a sufficient way for the controller to give information required by Art. 15(1)(a) to (h) and (2) unless the \u00ab\u00a0tailored and updated\u00a0\u00bb information is the same as the information provided at the beginning of the processing.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.1), margin number 113. Under Article 15(1)(a) GDPR, the controller must communicate the individual purposes of the processing pursued by the controller with regard to a given data subject. The ex-ante information obligation of the controller provides for a similar provision under Article 13(1)(c) and/or 14(1)(c) GDPR . Article 15(1)(a) GDPR requires that the same information about the purpose of the processing is provided, but from a factual ex-post perspective. Just like under Article 13(1)(c) GDPR the information must be linked to the specific personal data that the controller grants access to. [ 36 ] A mere list of purposes is not sufficient. See more details under Article 13(1)(c) GDPR. For example: The privacy policy mentions that certain personal data could be processed for various different purposes. However, the specific data subject's personal data was only found in the newsletter system of the controller. Therefore, the factually accurate information would be that the personal data was only used for direct marketing. To ensure that the information is useful, the controller must explain which data was used for which purpose. However, other than Article 13(1)(c) and 14(1)(c) GDPR this provision does not contain an obligation to mention the legal basis tied to each single purpose. [ 37 ] A logical interpretation may be that the legislator would expect a controller not to change the legal basis or at least inform data subjects about such a change instantly under Article 13(1)(c) and/or 14(1)(c) GDPR . Since the information about the legal basis is necessary for the data subject in order to assess the lawfulness of the processing activity, the controller should always provide this information in addition to the purposes for which the data is processed. [ 38 ] This is particularly true if there is any divergence from the initial information provided under Article 13 or 14 GDPR, in order to ensure accurate and transparent information in line with Article 12 GDPR , as it would otherwise be impossible for the data subject to verify the lawfulness of a certain processing operation. [ 39 ] \"In order to facilitate the exercise of data subjects\u2019 rights in line with Article 12(2) GDPR, the controller is recommended to also inform the data subject as to the applicable legal basis for each processing operation or to indicate where they can find this information. In any event, the principle of transparent processing requires that the information on the legal bases of the processing be made available to the data subject in an accessible way (e.g. in a privacy notice).\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.1), margin number 114. Just like the ex-ante information in Article 14(1)(d) GDPR , Article 15(1)(b) GDPR requires controllers to disclose the categories of personal data involved in the processing. While a data subject also receives access to the specific information that is processed, the information about the categories of personal data can provide the data subject with a transparent overview of the processed data. This can be particularly helpful in case of large processing activities involving vast quantities of the data subject's personal data. [ 40 ] Further, a data subject could also potentially limit its request to only a list of categories in order to grasp the basic functionality of a processing activity. [ 41 ] For further details see commentary on the similar ex-ante provision Article 14(1)(d) GDPR . Similar to the ex-ante information in Article 13(1)(e) and 14(1)(e) GDPR , Article 15(1)(c) GDPR requires the controller to disclose information about \" recipients or categories of recipients \" to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed. This provision does not give controllers a free choice whether to only disclose categories of recipients or specific recipients. The data subject can therefore request a list of the actual recipients, unless this is not available to the controller. [ 42 ] \"[...] Article 15(1)(c) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the data subject\u2019s right of access to personal data concerning him or her, provided for by that provision, entails, where those data have been or will be disclosed to recipients, an obligation on the part of the controller to provide the data subject with the actual identity of those recipients, unless it is impossible to identify those recipients or the controller demonstrates that the data subject\u2019s requests for access are manifestly unfounded or excessive within the meaning of Article 12(5) of the GDPR, in which cases the controller may indicate to the data subject only the categories of recipients in question.\" CJEU - C-154/21 - \u00d6sterreichische Post (Information regarding the recipients of personal data) , margin number 51. For example: In its privacy policy, a credit information agency affirms that the user's personal data can be passed on to \u201ccustomers that access your information to obtain credit information\u201d. This information is in acceptable as a forward-looking statement in a privacy policy when it is unclear which customers may access the information in the future. However, once the controller knows from the log files or accounting information that three specific online shops have bought the data, the name of the recipients must be disclosed under Article 15(1)(c). This interpretation is also strengthened by Article 19 GDPR , which requires the controller to \u201c inform the data subject about [the specific] recipients if the data subject requests it \u201d. [ 43 ] It should also be pointed out that Articles 24 and 25 GDPR generally require the controller to implement measures enabling it to understand which personal data was provided to which recipient (e.g. in order to ensure that the data subject has a transparent and clear picture about the sharing of his or her personal data). In addition to the specific recipients that received the data subject's personal data, the controller has to provide information on any potential future recipients. [ 44 ] See commentary on Article 13(1)(e) GDPR. The information about the recipients of personal data do not contain the information about specific employees of the controller handling the data subject's data when they process personal data under the authority of that controller and in accordance with its instructions. [ 45 ] However, if employees process the data excessively for their own purposes they would constitute a recipient in the sense of Article 4(9) GDPR. [ 46 ] For processors qualification as recipients see commentary on Article 13(1)(e) GDPR. In this context it should be recalled, that in general, also log files (i.e. information about access to a data subject's data) falls in the scope of Article 15(1) GDPR and have to be provided when providing a data subject access to their data; considering that this data provides information on the frequency and intensity of the consultation operations and might enable the data subject to assess whether the processing is carried out in accordance with the purposes invoked by the controller. [ 47 ] Similar to the ex-ante information in Article 13(2)(a) and 14(2)(a) GDPR , Article 15(1)(d) GDPR requires the provision of information on the intended period of time for which personal data will be stored, whenever possible. If not possible, the criteria used to determine the period must be provided instead. See commentary on Article 13(2)(a) GDPR. The information provided by the controller must be specific enough for the data subject to be aware of the duration of storage with regard to their personal data. In case it is not feasible to specify the deletion time, the storage duration and its starting point or triggering event (such as the end of a contract or expiration of a warranty period) should be specified. [ 48 ] \"The mere reference, for example to \"deletion after expiry of the statutory storage periods\" is not sufficient. Indications concerning data storage periods will have to focus on the specific data relating to the data subject. If the personal data of the data subject is subject to different deletion periods (e.g. because not all data is subject to legal storage obligations), the deletion periods shall be stated in relation to the respective processing operations and categories of data.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.1), margin number 118. Similar to the ex-ante information in Article 13(2)(b) and 14(2)(c) GDPR , Article 15(1)(e) GDPR the controller is required to inform the data subjects about their right to rectification , erasure or restriction of processing and about their right to object to the processing of their personal data. This information should be tailored to the specific position of the data subject and refer to the ongoing processing operations. If a right is not applicable in the specific case (e.g. no right to objection due to the legal basis of the processing activity) the information about that right should be avoided in order to provide the data subject with suitable information. [ 49 ] It is unclear why some rights (withdrawal of consent, data portability) that are mentioned in Article 13 and 14 GDPR are not mentioned in Article 15 GDPR. If applicable, controllers should provide data subjects with information about these rights anyway in order to ensure a transparent processing activity and to facilitate data subjects rights as required in Article 12 GDPR . [ 50 ] Similar to the ex-ante information in Article 13(2)(d) and 14(2)(e) GDPR , Article 15(1)(f) GDPR requires controllers to inform the data subject about the possibility to lodge a complaint with \" a supervisory authority \". This information does not require any kind of personalisation, given that a data subject can file a complaint with any authority under Article 77 GDPR . See commentary on Article 13(2)(d) GDPR. This provision is the ex-post counterpart to the controllers' information obligation in case personal data are not collected from the data subject in accordance with Article 14(2)(f) GDPR . This provision requires the data controller to inform the user about the actual individual sources from which their specific personal data have been collected, in case the personal data are not collected from the data subject directly. Just like under Article 14(2)(f) GDPR a source may be third party (like a data broker) or a technical source (like a camera). See commentary on Article 14(2)(f) GDPR . \"According to Art. 15(1)(g), \u201cany available information\u201d as to the source of the data has to be provided, where the personal data are not collected from the data subject. The degree of available information may change over time.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.1), margin number 120. Similar to the information about recipients (see above, Article 15(1)(c) GDPR), the information about data sources should enable the data subjects to enforce their rights under the GDPR against the controller as well as against the data source directly. [ 51 ] The usage of the wording \" any available information \" suggests a high degree of specificity required in relation to the sources from which the controller has obtained the data. Therefore, it is not always sufficient to provide information on the identity on the sources but the information should include the means of the collection of data. [ 52 ] Further, the controller must explain which personal data is obtained from what source. A mere list of all sources, without explaining which specific personal data was obtained from each source, is not transparent and is considered insufficient. In comparison to Article 14(2)(e) GDPR it is unclear how the additional element of \" any available \" information must be understood. In comparison with the requirement to take \" appropriate measures \" under Article 12(1) GDPR, it seems that Article 15(1)(c) GDPR goes further. \" Any available \" information would, for example, also include knowledge of employees, information that can be derived from business records (e.g. the sale of personal data) and alike. In any way, \"any available information\" should not be understood in meaning that the controller is not required to store information about the sources of personal data and can therefore easily dispose of this obligation by deleting the information. [ 53 ] Rather, the controller is generally obliged to make sure it has this information available. [ 54 ] Article 15(1)(h) GDPR provides for a right to information about: the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22 GDPR ; meaningful information about the logic involved; as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject. This provision uses the same language as Article 13(2)(f) and 14(2)(g) GDPR . See commentary on Article 13(2)(f) for more details. But just like with all other information under Article 15 GDPR, the information would have to relate to the specific processing of the data subject (i.e. the automated decision or profiling it was subjected to). Therefore Article 15(1)(h) GDPR provides for the right to an explanation regarding a specific decision the data subject was subject to. [ 55 ] \"Article 15(1)(h) of the GDPR affords the data subject a genuine right to an explanation as to the functioning of the mechanism involved in automated decision-making of which that person was the subject and of the result of that decision. [...] \u2018meaningful information about the logic involved\u2019 [...] must describe the procedure and principles actually applied in such a way that the data subject can understand which of his or her personal data have been used in the automated decision-making at issue, with the complexity of the operations to be carried out in the context of automated decision-making not being capable of relieving the controller of the duty to provide an explanation.\" CJEU - C\u2011203/22 - Dun & Bradstreet Austria , margin number 57 and 61. Furthermore due to the direct reference to Article 22 GDPR , it can be concluded that, in the case of relevant automated decisions under Article 22(1) GDPR , the provision also covers explanations of any safeguards provided for in Article 22(3) GDPR . \"[I]n the specific context of the adoption of a decision based solely on automated processing, the main purpose of the data subject\u2019s right to obtain the information provided for in Article 15(1)(h) of the GDPR is to enable him or her to effectively  exercise the rights conferred on him or her by Article 22(3) of that regulation, namely the right to express his or her point of view on that decision and to contest it.\" CJEU - C\u2011203/22 - Dun & Bradstreet Austria , margin number 55. The information should at least include details on the procedure and principles actually applied in order to obtain a specific result. [ 56 ] The provision of the algorithm itself (i.e. a complex mathematical formula) will not satisfy the requirements set out in Article 12 GDPR, stipulating that the communication must be provided by means of relevant information and in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form. [ 57 ] Similar to the ex-ante information in Article 13(2)(f) and 14(2)(f) GDPR , Article 15(2) GDPR requires that in case the controller transfers data to a third country or international organisation, the data subject has the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46 GDPR relating to the transfer. While it is argued that this obligation is not applicable in case of an adequacy decision under Article 45 GDPR or regarding other means mentioned in Article 13(2)(f) and 14(2)(f) GDPR , a controller should provide information on the specific transfer mechanism used similarly to the initial information obligation. [ 58 ] Article 15(3) GDPR constitutes the right to receive a copy of all personal data undergoing processing. This obligation is to be understood not as a separate right, but as the modality of how the personal data mentioned in Article 15(1) GDPR has to be provided to the data subject. [ 59 ] Such a requirement to provide a copy strengthens the right of access under Article 15(1) GDPR and means that the information on the personal data concerning the person who makes the request is provided to the data subject not just as a report by the controller, but as a \" faithful reproduction\" of the original. [ 60 ] It also allows the data subject to retain all provided personal data, keep it and to come back to it. \"The obligation to provide a copy serves the objectives of the right of access to allow the data subject to be aware of, and verify the lawfulness of the processing\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.1), margin number 24. The scope of the provision reflects the definition of personal data provided for in Article 4(1) GDPR and has the same meaning as in Article 15(1) GDPR. [ 61 ] The definition of \"copy\" was debated in legal doctrine and jurisprudence. [ 62 ] In summary, on one hand, it was argued that a copy is a document, whether analog or digital, created by extracting information from other documents or systems in use (such as email clients, meeting minutes, or data system files related to the data subject). On the other hand, it was claimed that a copy should, where possible, be an exact reproduction of the original document itself (such as an email or meeting minutes). [ 63 ] The matter is largely clarified by the CJEU now. \"15(3) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the right to obtain from the controller a copy of the personal data undergoing processing means that the data subject must be given a faithful and intelligible reproduction of all those data. That right entails the right to obtain copies of extracts from documents or even entire documents or extracts from databases which contain, inter alia, those data, if the provision of such a copy is essential in order to enable the data subject to exercise effectively the rights conferred on him or her by that regulation, bearing in mind that account must be taken, in that regard, of the rights and freedoms of others.\" CJEU - C-487/21 - \u00d6sterreichische Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rde and CRIF , margin number 45. The CJEU shows a certain flexibility in the interpretation of the notion of \" copy \". A copy can be described as a \" faithful reproduction or transcription of an original \u201d in opposition to a \u201c purely general description \u201d of data. Therefore, in principle, Article 15(3) covers extracts from documents or even entire documents or extracts from databases. [ 64 ] However, due to the teleological interpretation adopted by the court, what a controller is obliged to provide ultimately depends on the principle of effectiveness. It is crucial that the data subject is given the information in a durable, tangible form (such as text or electronic format) that can be stored and retrieved for future reference. [ 65 ] Especially, when personal data is contained in documents that also contain other matters, such as a list of \"low performers\" or an email with information about the data subject, the context of the document may be more relevant than the \"raw\" personal data (e.g. only the name contained in the document). In light of Article 12 GDPR , the context should be provided as far as possible, to ensure a transparent and accurate response to an access request. \"The controller can, although is not necessarily obliged to, provide the documents which contain personal data about the data subjects making the request in their original form. [...] This, however, does not mean that the data subject always has the right to obtain a copy of the documents containing the personal data, but an unaltered copy of the personal data being processed in these documents.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.1), margin number 152. Regardless of the manner in which the personal data is provided by the controller, whether through the original documents or a compilation of the data, the information should still adhere to the transparency standards specified in Article 12 GDPR . In certain situations, compiling and/or extracting the data in a comprehensible manner may be a means of complying with these standards. On the other hand, in some cases, it may be more effective to provide a copy of the actual document containing the personal data to facilitate better understanding. Therefore, the appropriate form of information provision must be determined on a case-by-case basis. [ 66 ] \"In some cases, the personal data itself sets the requirements in what format the personal data should be provided. For example, when the personal data constitutes handwritten information by the data subject, the data subject may need to be provided with a photocopy of that handwritten information, as the handwriting itself is personal data. That could especially be the case when the handwriting is something that matters to the processing, e.g. scripture analysis. The same applies in general for audio recordings because the voice of the data subject itself is personal data. In some cases, however, access can be given by providing a transcription of the conversation, for example, if agreed upon between the data subject and the controller.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.0), martin number 155. The second sentence of Article 15(3) GDPR regulates cases where the data subject requests an additional copy of the same personal data. [ 67 ] In such circumstances, the controller may charge a reasonable fee based on the costs of administration. [ 68 ] \"At the same time, the fee should be appropriate, taking into account the importance of the right of access as a fundamental right of the data subject. The controller should not pass on overhead costs or other general expenses to the data subject, but should focus on the specific costs that where caused by providing the additional copy. When organising this process the controller should deploy its human and material resources efficiently in order to keep the costs of the copy low, including if the controller involves external support. In case the controller decides to charge a fee, the controller should indicate in advance that a fee will be charged and \u2013 as accurately as is possible - the amount of costs it is planning to charge to the data subject in order to give the data subject the possibility to determine whether to maintain or to withdraw the request.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.1), margin number 30 et seq. It should be noted that this regulates a different case than Article 12(5) GDPR which provides for the controller's option to charge a reasonable fee in case of manifestly unfounded or excessive requests. Article 15(3) GDPR allows to charge a reasonable fee for further copies even if these requirements in Article 12(5) GDPR are not met. [ 69 ] A further copy should not be confused with a new request under Article 15 GDPR for personal data. Rather, this case handles the request of further copies of the same copy of personal data already provided by the controller. [ 70 ] The GDPR does not impose any requirements on data subjects regarding the form of the request for access to the personal data. Regardless, under Article 15(3), third sentence, GDPR, if the data subject submits an access request electronically, the format of the \"information\" should be provided in a common electronic format, unless the data subject specifies a different format. This also implies that in the case of a paper application, copies must be made available in paper form, if requested by the data subject. Ultimately, the data subject should determine the format of the copies. [ 71 ] When determining the commonly used electronic form to provide information to a data subject, the controller should not rely solely on its own format but rather make an objective assessment. The assessment should consider whether there are specific formats commonly used in the controller's area of operation or in the given context. If there are no such formats, open formats set in an international standard such as ISO should generally be considered. However, the EDPB does not exclude the possibility of other formats being commonly used. When making this assessment, it is important to consider how easily the data subject can access the information in the provided format. The controller should provide information to the data subject on how to access a file in a specific format, including any programs or software that could be used to make it more accessible. The data subject should not be required to purchase software to access the information. [ 72 ] If in doubt, a controller can ask the data subject as to the formats it can read. Most software also allows to export personal data in different formats or convert the file in multiple formats. For example: Typical formats for a copy that can be opened by freely available reader software are CSV, PDF, HTML, OpenDocument file, Microsoft Word or Excel files. In certain areas, other formats may be common tool. A technically advanced data subject may prefer an XML or JSON format for raw data. The right to obtain a copy under Article 15(3) GDPR is constrained by Article 15(4) GDPR which states that the right to obtain a copy of personal data undergoing processing shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. The restriction applies to the copy of personal data processed by the controller and not to the information the controller has to disclose in accordance with Article 15(1)(a)-(h) GDPR. [ 73 ] Common mistake: Many readers think that the limitations in Article 15(4) GDPR also cover the information that must be provided under Article 15(1) and (2) GDPR. This is not accurate. Article 15(4) only refers to the right to obtain a copy in Article 15(3) GDPR. However, restrictions in the right of access could also be provided by Union or Member State law in accordance with Article 23(1) GDPR (see below). [ 74 ] For example, Article 15 GDPR might be restricted in order to protect  trade secrets under Directive 2016/943. [ 75 ] Another exemption from the right to Article 15 GDPR in case of manifestly unfounded or excessive requests can be found in Article 12(5) GDPR (see commentary there). Article 15(4) GDPR is drafted in rather absolute terms \" shall not affect the rights and freedoms of other s\". However, the right to access it a fundamental right under Article 8(2) CFR and may only be limited in accordance with Article 52(1) CFR , which requires that any limitation must be \" proportionate \". Article 15(4) GDPR must therefore be interpreted in the light of the Charter, which leads to the conclusion that conflicting rights must be \" balanced \" against the right to access on a case-by-case basis. \"[I]n the event of conflict between, on the one hand, exercising the right of full and complete access to personal data and, on the other hand, the rights and freedoms of others, a balance will have to be struck between the rights in question. Wherever possible, means of communicating personal data that do not infringe the rights or freedoms of others should be chosen, bearing in mind that, as follows from recital 63 of the GDPR, \u2018the result of those considerations should not be a refusal to provide all information to the data subject\u2019.\" CJEU - C-487/21 - \u00d6sterreichische Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rde and CRIF , margin number 44. Under Article 15(4) GDPR, the right to obtain a copy shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. The specific rights and freedoms are not named. According to Recital 63 such conflicting rights include the right to data protection of others or trade secrets or intellectual property. [ 76 ] However, as affirmed by the Recital, the fact that conflicting rights are involved cannot not be an excuse to deny the right of access. The controller must instead find less intrusive options to provide as much information as possible, while still protecting the rights of others. Usually other information can be blackened, redacted or otherwise protected. \"[I]n the event of conflict between, on the one hand, exercising the right of full and complete access to personal data and, on the other hand, the rights and freedoms of others, a balance will have to be struck between the rights in question. Wherever possible, means of communicating personal data that do not infringe the rights or freedoms of others should be chosen, bearing in mind that, as follows from recital 63 of the GDPR, \u2018the result of those considerations should not be a refusal to provide all information to the data subject\u2019.\" CJEU - C-487/21 - F.F. v DSB , margin number 44. For example: If camera footage recorded more than one person, the right to access may be granted. The controller must anonymise any other data subjects in the footage. [ 77 ] Article 15(4) GDPR only mentions the rights and freedoms of \" others \". This includes the rights and freedoms of the controller. \"'Others' means any other person or entity apart from the data subject who is exercising their right of access. Hence, the rights and freedoms of the controller or processor (in keeping trade secrets and intellectual property confidential for example) might be considered. If the EU legislator wanted to exclude controllers or processors rights and freedoms, it would have used the term 'third party', which is defined in Art. 4(10) GDPR.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.1), margin number 171. Article 15(1) to (3) GDPR may also be limited by Article 12(5) GDPR in the case of \" manifestly unfounded or excessive requests \" (see commentary on Article 12(5) GDPR ). Furthermore, Union or Member State law may restrict the right of access in accordance with Article 23 GDPR . Derogations regarding the processing of personal data for scientific and historical research, statistical or archiving purposes in the public interest can be based on Articles 89 GDPR , as well as for processing carried out for journalistic purposes and academic artistic or literary expression on Article 85 GDPR .

personal data concerning him or her. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement. Article 16 GDPR provides for the data subject's right to request the rectification of inaccurate personal data. Primarily, the rectification will be carried out by correcting inaccurate data. However, it can also be appropriate to rectify the information by completing incomplete information (e.g. by a supplementary statement to the existing information). Similarly to the right of access under Article 15  GDPR , the right to rectification requires a request of the data subject and is in itself not an obligation the controller has to comply with on its own initiative. However, the data subject's right to rectification is closely connected to the principle of accuracy in Article 5(1)(d) GDPR which requires the controller to actively take every reasonable step to ensure that inaccurate data is erased or rectified. [ 1 ] So, even in the absence of a request by the data subject, the controller has a duty to actively correct inaccurate personal data. However, Article 5(1)(d) GDPR gives the controller some leeway to continue the processing of inaccurate data - see more details under Article 5(1)(d) GDPR . But, in many cases, the controller will not be aware that the data subject's personal data is (or became) inaccurate which makes the exercise of the right to rectification necessary. The right to rectification is often preceded by an access request under Article 15 GDPR since this is regularly the requirement to understand what data is actually processed by the controller and to assess the accurateness of that data. [ 2 ] It should be undisputed that the processing of incorrect or incomplete data can lead to possibly severe disadvantages for data subjects reducing the risk of exclusion, discrimination, or defamation. [ 3 ] Since personal data is regularly used in order to make decisions affecting the data subject, the use of incorrect data can lead to all kind of negative consequences for the data subject. [ 4 ] Therefore, data subjects have a significant interest that their data undergoing processing is accurate. [ 5 ] For example: The processing of inaccurate (e.g. old) income data could lead to the rejection of a required loan. The use of inaccurate medical data could lead to a wrong medical treatment. \nThe use of  a wrong address could lead to the unwanted and unlawful disclosure of personal data to wrong recipients.  \nTherefore, in many cases false information about a data subject can also lead to severe (emotional or even physical) distress. The data subject's right to rectification provides, similarly to other rights under the GDPR, for means to exercise some level of control over the processing of personal data. [ 6 ] This right is also explicitly named as a fundamental right in Article 8(2) CFR . It is therefore important that it is interpreted in the light of the Charter and the principle of proportionality in Article 52(1) CFR . [ 7 ] \"That provision gives specific expression to the fundamental right enshrined in the second sentence of Article 8(2) of the Charter, according to which everyone has the right of access to data which have been collected concerning him or her, and the right to have them rectified.\" CJEU - C-247/23 - Deldits , margin number 24. Article 16 GDPR must be read in conjunction with Article 12 GDPR which provides for modalities and formal rules regarding the exercise of rights. [ 8 ] In its first sentence, Article 16 GDPR provides for the right to rectify inaccurate personal data. This is followed in the provision's second sentence by the introduction of the right to have incomplete personal data completed. This right to complete personal data can be understood as a special case of the right to rectification (for more information on this special case see the point bellow). [ 9 ] The data subject's right to rectification needs to be exercised by the data subject before the controller. In other words, in order to exercise this right, the data subject needs to request the controller to make the necessary changes (i.e. correct or complete the data). Regularly, the effective exercise of the right to rectification will require a prior access request by the data subject in order to find out about the specific personal data undergoing processing. But, the data subject is in no way required to make an access request prior to exercising their right to rectification. Similarly, there is no hierarchy between the data subject's rights in Chapter III of the GDPR. In some situations the data subject will therefore have the choice whether it wants to request the erasure under Article 17 GDPR or the rectification of the data under Article 16 GDPR. [ 10 ] The data subject making the rectification request can demand the the controller corrects the personal data. This means that the controller modifies the data in a way that the contextual meaning reflects the reality. [ 11 ] This can be done by changing the data (e.g. amending a incorrect birth date to the correct one), by partial or complete deletion of information (a bank's customer's file shows an inaccurate payment default that is deleted after the data subject's request to rectify its customer file), or by completion (i.e. a data subject's employment file is supplemented since some working days were not entered into the system). [ 12 ] If the personal data just documents the state of the information at a previous time, and the data became inaccurate later, the controller can generally continue to process the data in the previous form as long as it is clear that the data only refers to the prior point in time. [ 13 ] The rectification request does not have to be justified or motivated and the data subject does not have to claim the existence of damage due to the inaccurate data. [ 14 ] However, the data subject has to provide the controller with some substantiation for the claim of inaccuracy and how the data should be rectified. [ 15 ] \"[T]he data subject, requesting the rectification of those data, may be required to provide relevant and sufficient evidence which, in the light of the circumstances of the particular case, can reasonably be required of that person in order to establish that those data are inaccurate [...].\" CJEU - C-247/23 - Deldits , margin number 41. There is some debate on what the controller is obliged to do in case the correctness of the allegedly incorrect data cannot be determined (i.e. neither the data subject nor the controller can prove the (in)correctness). Keeping in mind the controller's obligation to demonstrate compliance with the principle of accuracy, the controller should correct or delete the disputed information. [ 16 ] Further, reference can be made to the modalities of data subject's requests under Article 12 GDPR . If the controller declines a rectification request by the data, it must provide reasons for their decision (see Article 12(4) GDPR ). The data subject has some options for recourse, such as filing a complaint with a supervisory authority or pursuing a judicial remedy. In case the data is rectified, it should be recalled that Article 19 GDPR requires controllers to notify each recipient of the affected personal data in order to enable the correction of the information also by the recipients. [ 17 ] In accordance with Article 16 GDPR, the controller has to answer the rectification request \" without undue delay \". However, the deadline stipulated in Article 12(3) GDPR which requires an action by the controller \" without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request \" [ 18 ] , still applies. This deadline, under Article 12(3) GDPR, may be extended by two months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests. Under Article 12(4) GDPR , any extension of the deadline must be communicated to the data subject alongside the reason behind it (see commentary on Article 12 GDPR). The controller has to assess the validity of the rectification request and determine if it meets the eligibility requirements; this will need some time and maybe even require some clarifying questions to the data subject. To prevent the data from being processed (and possibly used incorrectly) during this period, the data subject has the right to restrict processing for a specific time frame to allow the controller to verify the data accuracy under Article 18(1)(a) GDPR . The only requirement in order for the data subject to claim this right is to dispute the accuracy of its data. Thus, in addition to a rectification request the data subject may also exercise its right to restrict the processing whilst the request is being carried out. [ 19 ] The first sentence of Article 16 GDPR concerns the right to rectify inaccurate data. The GDPR does not provide a more detailed definition of what constitutes inaccuracy (see commentary on the discussion of what constitutes \" inaccurate \" data in Article 5(1)(d) GDPR ). \"[...] Article 16 of the GDPR must be read in the light, first, of Article 5(1)(d) of the GDPR, which enshrines the principle of accuracy, under which processed data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date, and that every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay. Second, that provision must also be read in the light of recital 59 of the GDPR, from which it is apparent that modalities should be provided for facilitating the exercise of the data subject\u2019s rights under that regulation, including mechanisms to request and, if applicable, obtain, free of charge, in particular, rectification of personal data. [T]he assessment of whether personal data is accurate and complete must be made in the light of the purpose for which those data were collected [...].\" CJEU - C-247/23 - Deldits , margin number 25 et seq. with further references. In general, one can separate objective facts (e.g. a birth date), forecasts and predictions that are based on scientific methods (e.g. the creditworthiness) and mere value judgements (e.g. if a person is attractive). While mere value judgements cannot be \"inaccurate\", predictions, forecasts and objective facts can be inaccurate. [ 20 ] For example: A bank employee is meant to assess a credit application. If the system is based on the wrong name, address or birth date, it is based on inaccurate data, which can be corrected. If the system also uses a \"credit score\" that is solely based on the name, address or birth date, it likely yields statistically inaccurate results, which can be corrected. If the employee simply has a bad feeling in relation to the applicant's ability to pay back the loan, this is a pure value judgement and cannot be corrected. However, it may be even feasible to rectify a value judgment itself , when the underlying facts and/or the decision-making process are objectively wrong. [ 21 ] If, for example, an examiner assesses the quality of answers provided by a data subject, there might be situations where the examiner\u2019s comments (in itself value judgments ) with respect to those answers prove to be inaccurate, for example due to the fact that, by mistake, the examination scripts were mixed up in such a way that the answers of another candidate were ascribed to the data subject, or that some of the cover sheets containing the answers of the data subject are lost, so that those answers are incomplete, or that any comments made by an examiner do not accurately record the examiner\u2019s evaluation of the answers of the data subject. [ 22 ] If personal data is only estimated , and as long as this fact is clearly noted, the estimation should also be considered a mere value judgement rather than a fact. [ 23 ] E.g., a marketing agency estimates the household income of a data subject based on publicly available statistics; such an information would generally not be subject to the right to rectification. For the purposes of Article 16 GDPR it should be pointed out that also objectively correct information can be inaccurate in the sense that they are incomplete and therefore lead to a wrong impression. In such a case, the data subject has the right to complete the inaccurate (i.e. incomplete) personal data. [ 24 ] It is debated, whether minor inaccuracies that do not have any relevance or impact on the data processing itself can be considered irrelevant for the purposes of this provision, with the consequence that there would be no right to rectify in connection to such minor inaccuracies. [ 25 ] These could be grammatical or orthographic errors, such as a misspelled street name or a missing \"h\" in the name \"Katharina,\" or an umlaut written out in the internal databases as long as - by the nature of the processing activity - such inaccuracies cannot possibly cause confusion or consequential errors. [ 26 ] However, particular mistakes related to the spelling of a name can normally not be considered insignificant because they impact the primary identifier of the data subject in the realm of automated data processing, which can lead to confusion and subsequent errors. [ 27 ] It is irrelevant why the data is incorrect. The controller must not have had any bad faith to trigger Article 16 GDPR. Even if the data subject himself or herself originally provided incorrect information, Article 16 GDPR is applicable. If the data is inaccurate, it must be rectified. [ 28 ] Similarly, the right to rectification is also applicable if personal data was originally correct but later became incorrect (e.g. because the data subject moved his address), [ 29 ] unless, of course, the personal data is only meant to document the situation at a particular point in time. [ 30 ] A data subject can only exercise their right to rectification if the inaccurate personal data refers to them. If the personal data refers to someone else, they cannot request the rectification under Article 16 GDPR. [ 31 ] However, considering the principle of accuracy in Article 5(1)(d) GDPR, the controller will generally be obliged to rectify inaccurate personal data whenever it is aware of it. In order to have the right to rectification, it is sufficient if personal data refers also to the data subject as well as to other people. [ 32 ] The right to completion of incomplete data (second sentence of Article 16 GDPR) can be considered a special case of the more general right to rectification provided in Article 16 GDPR. [ 33 ] This specific case of the right to rectification gives data subjects the right to have incomplete personal data completed. Whether data is incomplete within the meaning of Article 16 GDPR is a relative concept and depends on the purpose of processing (\" taking into account the purposes of the processing \"). [ 34 ] Therefore, personal data can be considered incomplete if it is objectively correct but, in the context of the purposes of the processing, lead to an inaccurate representation of reality. [ 35 ] For example: In terms of creditworthiness, information about a refusal to pay is incomplete without the additional information that the reason for the refusal was a dispute over incorrect delivery of goods. [ 36 ] The means for completing incomplete data is normally the addition of more information. The additional information has to be accurate and, together with the already processed information, lead to conclusions that accurately reflect reality. [ 37 ] The GDPR explicitly states that the right to complete incomplete personal data can be fulfilled through a supplementary statement . This is meant to ensure the data subject is not confined to the limited data fields provided by the controller when exercising his rights under Article 16 GDPR. Supplementary explanations provided by the data subject must be taken into account if they are necessary to accurately and unambiguously contextualize the personal information. In this respect, the act of completing personal data can be executed by providing a supplementary statement. [ 38 ] Since the modalities set out in Article 12 GDPR apply to Article 16, the controller can refuse to act on a request or charge a reasonable fee in case of manifestly unfounded or excessive requests. However, due to the nature of the right to rectification, this has practically a rather small relevance. Further, Union or Member State law may restrict the right of access in accordance with Article 23 GDPR . Derogations regarding the processing of personal data for scientific and historical research, statistical or archiving purposes in the public interest can be based on Articles 89 GDPR , as well as for processing carried out for journalistic purposes and academic artistic or literary expression on Article 85 GDPR . \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 16 GDPR \u2191 Meents, Hinzpeter , in Taeger, Gabel, DSGVO - BDSG - TTSG, Article 16, margin number 3 (C.H.

References 1.   The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies: 2.   Where the controller has made the personal data public and is obliged pursuant to paragraph 1 to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform controllers which are processing the personal data that the data subject has requested the erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data. 3.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to the extent that processing is necessary: Article 17 GDPR confers upon the data subject the right to have its personal data erased. However, this is not an absolute right. Rather, Article 17(1) GDPR provides for specific scenarios in which a data subject has the right to demand the erasure of its personal data. In contrast to the data subjects' right of access and rectification in Articles 15 and 16 GDPR , Article 17 GDPR also provides for a direct obligation of the controller to delete personal data in case any of the scenarios listed in Article 17(1) GDPR applies. For example: \"A data subject withdraws her consent to the use of her data for advertisement. The controller must automatically stop processing her personal data for that purpose and delete the data if no other purpose with a valid legal basis necessitates the processing of the same personal data. There is no need to additionally exercise the right to erasure. However, if the data subject suspects that her personal data may not be fully deleted, she may exercise the right to erasure.\" Article 17(1) GDPR establishes the right to deletion of personal data and imposes an obligation on the controller to erase the personal data when the conditions listed in this paragraph are met. To enhance the effectiveness of the right to deletion, especially on the internet (see Recital 66), Article 17(2) GDPR introduces the so-called right to be forgotten which imposes a further obligation on the controller in case the personal data was made public by the controller. [ 1 ] In this case, the controller has to inform other controllers processing the affected personal data of the request to delete all links, copies or duplicates of the data, through appropriate technical and cost-effective measures. Article 17(3) GDPR sets out the exceptions to the rules outlined in Article 17(1) and (2) GDPR, which are largely repeating existing grounds for the legal processing of personal data in various parts of the GDPR. Common mistake: Overall, the article is not well-drafted and is partly oversold by politics and the media. The title suggest more rights for the data subject than what the text of the article provides for. The 'right to be forgotten' or 'erasure' is often understood by data subjects to be an absolute right to have personal data deleted - however if the controller has a legal basis for the processing of personal data, the exercise of Article 17 GDPR has often no effect. EDPB Guidelines : For this Article see EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 05/2019 on the criteria of the Right to be Forgotten in the search engines cases under the GDPR (part 1)\u2019, 7 July 2020 (Version 2.0) (available here ). The right to erasure does not constitute an absolute right granted to data subjects. It can be exercised only if one of the following grounds for deletion applies, which, at the same time, obliges the controller to erase the affected personal data on its own initiative. Therefore, the right of the data subject mainly serves the enforcement of the controller\u2019s independent obligation to erase personal data. [ 2 ] \"[A] requirement that there must be a prior request from data subjects, in terms of Article 17(1) of the GDPR, would mean that the controller, where there is no such request, could retain the personal data at issue and continue to process them unlawfully. Such an interpretation would undermine the effectiveness of the protection laid down by that regulation since it would result in persons who take no action being deprived of protection, even though their personal data have been processed unlawfully.\" CJEU - C-46/23 - \u00dajpesti Polg\u00e1rmesteri Hivatal , margin number 45. Article 17 of the GDPR does not contain specific provisions regarding the methods for exercising the right to erasure. Neither does it provide for particular formalities. These provisions can be found\u2013as for any data subject's rights\u2013in Article 12 GDPR , which includes the general obligation to provide information which is precise and clear ( Article 12(1) GDPR ), facilitate the data subject ( Article 12(2) GDPR ), respond and communicate the measures taken ( Article 12(3) and (4) GDPR ), the principle that request from data subjects must be satisfied free of charge ( Article 12(5) GDPR ) and the identity verification procedure in case of uncertainty  ( Articles 12(6) and 11 GDPR ). The act of erasing data constitutes a type of processing, as defined by Article 4(2) GDPR . The Regulation does not provide a definition of \"erasure\". It is clear, however, that the process must be effective. The crucial element is the outcome of the erasure process, which renders the information previously stored in the data factually irretrievable. Once the data is erased, it should not be feasible for anyone to perceive the information contained therein without resorting to disproportionate measures. [ 3 ] Some possible methods for erasing data include physically eliminating the data by overwriting or erasing it, using mechanical or chemical methods such as shredding the paper, burning or otherwise destroying the data carrier, scratching the surface of CDs, and destroying codes or decryption devices without removing the data itself. In general, deleting a link or reference in a file system (logical deletion) typically does not result in the actual erasure of the data, but only makes it more challenging to locate. The requirements for deletion under data protection laws are evolving due to technological advancements. It is crucial to acknowledge the possibility of recovering deleted data through specialised software. The use of such software is generally expected and feasible. [ 4 ] Deletion must be comprehensive and therefore applies to all data and data carriers, including data stored on backup media, as well as those belonging to contractors (e.g., stored in a \"cloud\") or employees' private data processing devices. In certain situations, preservation of backup copies may be justified due to the controller's legitimate interest or other applicable legal bases. The anonymisation of personal data is generally also considered a means to erase personal data, since it terminates the link between the natural person and the respective data. [ 5 ] The deletion obligation does not include any copies of the data made by third parties to whom the data has been disclosed. In this respect, there is an obligation to notify the erasure under Article 19 GDPR and the recipient may be subject to independent deletion obligations. [ 6 ] The GDPR does not clearly state the relationship between the 'right to erasure' and the ' right to be forgotten '. They are not interchangeable terms, but rather two distinct expressions of the rights of the data subject under Article 17 of the GDPR. Recital 66 clarifies that the ' right to be forgotten ' is related to the obligation under Article 17(2) to inform third parties about the erasure of personal data that has been made public. This obligation arises when the right to erasure is exercised. [ 7 ] For further information, see commentary under Article 17(2) GDPR below. The right to erasure under Article 17(1) GDPR applies to personal data which concerns the data subject. This primarily includes the data subject's own personal data, including profiling data, [ 8 ] and not those of third parties. However, personal data that concerns both the data subject and third parties can also be subject to an erasure request or the controller's independent erasure obligation. Limiting the right to erasure only to personal data that exclusively relates to the data subject would disproportionately restrict such right. However, before the deletion takes place, fundamental rights and interests of third parties to continue certain data processing should be taken into account (in particular in assessing the means of deletion). [ 9 ] For example: A controller is faced with a deletion request regarding a picture showing both the data subject and a third party. The third party still has a substantial interest in the processing of the picture by the controller and the controller has\u2013concerning the third party\u2013a valid legal basis for the processing. The controller could comply with the data subject's deletion request by eliminating any link between her and the picture, i.e. redacting the picture in a way that the data subject is not longer recognisable. See Commentary on Article 16 GDPR regarding the obligation to provide the information without undue delay and the applicability to the formal requirements in Article 12 GDPR; e.g. taking action in any event within one month of receipt of the request (subject to a possible extension of two more months). The erasure of personal data is not solely based on a request from the data subject. In accordance with Article 17(1) GDPR and Article 5 GDPR , and in particular the principles of lawfulness, data minimisation, and storage limitation, the controller must carry out the deletion independently if one of the elements included in the list (a-f) is met. For example, in the event that the data subject revokes their consent, it would be appropriate to proceed with the deletion of all personal data associated with the unauthorised processing. The same applies to processing that has achieved its purpose and therefore no longer has a viable purpose. In this case, it would also be necessary to delete all associated data. However, a blind execution of this obligation could lead to unacceptable results. Taking inspiration from the examples mentioned earlier, in the case of consent withdrawal, it is necessary to assess the scope of the data subject's action. If the revocation does not concern the entire processing but only a specific part, an indiscriminate erasure would not only be unadvisable but also inadmissible. The same applies when the purpose of the processing is pursued. In this circumstance, the data subject may request a restriction of processing (Article 18 GDPR) instead of deletion (Article 17(1)(a) GDPR), and a controller-initiated deletion may be deemed abusive. Based on the aforementioned considerations, there might be an obligation of the controller, based on the facilitation obligation, under Article 12(2) GDPR , to evaluate the situation on a case-by-case basis and, where necessary, contact the data subject for any clarifications regarding their intentions. [ 10 ] According to Article 17(1)(a) GDPR, personal data must be erased if they are no longer necessary for the purpose(s) they were initially collected for or otherwise processed. This scenario reflects the general GDPR principles of \"purpose limitation\", \"data minimisation\" and \u201cstorage limitation\u201d, as provided for in Articles 5(1)(b), (c) and (e) GDPR . [ 11 ] In other words, this scenario obliges the controller to delete personal data in case it was originally used for legitimate purposes, but the personal data is no longer necessary for those purposes. [ 12 ] Determining whether a purpose no longer exists should be assessed on a case-to-case basis. [ 13 ] However, controllers should implement a deletion policy in order to ensure that personal data is deleted in accordance with the principle of storage limitation, pursuant to Article 5(1)(e) GDRP . [ 14 ] \"[A] candidate may [\u2026.] have the right to ask the data controller to ensure that his examination answers and the examiner\u2019s comments with respect to them are, after a certain period of time, erased, that is to say, destroyed. [P]ersonal data is to be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data was collected or for which it is subsequently processed. Taking into consideration the purpose of the answers submitted by an examination candidate and of the examiner\u2019s comments with respect to those answers, their retention in a form permitting the identification of the candidate is, a priori, no longer necessary as soon as the examination procedure is finally closed and can no longer be challenged, so that those answers and comments have lost any probative value.\" CJEU - C-434/16 - Nowak , margin number 55. For example: Once the electronic health card has been issued, a health insurance company no longer requires the photograph to be stored, as an example. Similarly, if there are no further labour law disputes with an employee, an employer no longer needs to store a warning letter after the termination of the employment relationship, as noted in another example. Additionally, a provider of basic security for job seekers is not required to retain a copy of the identity card after the end of the benefit period. [ 15 ] This obligation to delete the personal data is not applicable in case the processing of personal data is necessary for realising another purpose (i.e. in case of legitimate further processing under Article 6(4) GDPR ). [ 16 ] For example: The customer of an insurance received a compensation for damages they had due to a flood. The insurance company processed information regarding that claim for the purposes of processing the claim. Some of the data was then further processed for a project evaluating the consequences of climate change on the insurance industry. Even if the data is not needed for the purposes of processing the claim, the data can be continue to be processed until it is no longer needed for the other purposes as well. An erasure request can also not be based on Article 17(1)(a) GDPR if there was never a legitimate purpose to begin with; in this case, the erasure is necessary under Article 17(1)(d) GDPR. [ 17 ] It should be noted that in case the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, the data subject can also request the restriction of the processing under Article 18(1)(c) GDPR in case they require the data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims (see commentary on Article 18 GDPR ). Article 17(1)(b) GDPR provides for a ground for erasure in case a data subject withdraws its consent to the processing under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR or, as the case may be, Article 9(2)(a) GDPR (see commentary on Article 7(3) GDPR for the right to withdraw consent). Requirement for an adequate ground for erasure is that the processing is based on the data subject's consent and there is no other legal ground for the processing; i.e. If a data subject withdraws their consent, their personal data must be deleted, unless there is another applicable legal basis that preserves the lawfulness of the processing. The provision's explicit acknowledgement of the potential for alternative legal grounds suggests that the initial processing may have relied on multiple legal bases concurrently, such as consent and another legal basis under Articles 6 or 9 GDPR. [ 18 ] It should be noted however, that invoking multiple legal bases for the same processing purpose (in particularly invoking another legal basis in parallel to the data subject's consent) is problematic when it comes to the transparency of the processing (see commentary on Article 6 GDPR ). [ 19 ] Therefore, when processing of personal data is based on separate legal bases, these legal bases regularly refer to different processing purposes. [ 20 ] For example: A company processes its customers data for the performance of a contract in accordance with Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. The customer also provided its consent for the usage of their data for marketing purposes. This consent is later withdrawn by the customer. The controller has to stop processing the customer's data for marketing purposes; however, it is not obliged to delete the data insofar as it is still needed for the performance of the contract, under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. Similarly to Article 17(1)(a) GDPR, this ground for erasure is applicable for a processing activity that was originally lawful. If the consent was invalid in the first place, the applicable ground for erasure is Article 17(1)(d) GDPR. [ 21 ] The withdrawal of consent in accordance with Article 7(3) GDPR obliges the controller to delete the personal data which is processed based on the consent; therefore, the data subject is generally not required to file a separate erasure request to demand the deletion of the data. If the data subject wishes the restriction of the data, they have to specifically demand this from the controller. [ 22 ] However, if the controller processes the personal data of a data subject and receives an erasure request by the data subject, this erasure request should also be considered as a withdrawal of the data subjects consent. [ 23 ] According to Article 17(1)(c) GDPR, personal data must be erased in two different cases. First, (i) an objection to processing in accordance with Article 21(1) GDPR has been raised by the data subject and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing. Second, (ii) the data subject has objected to direct marketing under Article 21(2) GDPR (see Commentary on Article 21 GDPR for more information on the right to object ). The first case concerns an objection to the processing in accordance with Article 21(1) GDPR , provided that no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing can be identified by the controller. [ 24 ] Some attention of interpreters has focused on the discrepancy between the terminology used in Article 17(1)(c) GDPR (\" no overriding legitimate grounds \") and that of Article 21(1) GDPR (\" compelling legitimate grounds \"). According to a first view, the two wordings refer to two distinct and non-overlapping concepts. In this perspective, the absence of \" compelling legitimate grounds \" ( Article 21(1) GDPR ) results in the obligation to interrupt a certain processing activity (\" shall no longer process personal data \", Article 21(1) GDPR ), but not necessarily to erase personal data. An actual erasure obligation would only arise if, following the first check under Article 21(1) GDPR , it were shown that there are no \" compelling legitimate grounds \" for deletion (Article 17 GDPR). [ 25 ] But, the discrepancy between those wordings can be considered irrelevant. Therefore, if a controller has no compelling legitimate grounds hindering an objection under Article 21(1) GDPR , the controller can also not invoke overriding legitimate grounds under Article 17(1)(c) GDPR . In other words, these provisions do not demand for different balancing tests. [ 26 ] Among others, the EDPB follows this view: Furthermore, it should be stressed that, in general, the criteria to determine whether an objection or an erasure request should be granted are essentially the same under Article 21 and Article 17 (i.e., the request should be granted unless one can demonstrate \u201coverriding legitimate grounds\u201d). This implies that, as a rule, if an objection under Article 21(1) GDPR is granted, a related erasure request under Article 17(1)(c) GDPR should also be granted. EDPB, 'Guidelines 1/2024 on processing of personal data based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR', 8 October 2024 (Version 1), margin number 78. This interpretation can also be based on case law of the CJEU: \u201cIt follows from [Article 17(1)(c) GDPR], read in conjunction with Article 21(1) of the GDPR, that the data subject enjoys a right to object to processing and a right to erasure, unless there are overriding legitimate grounds which take precedence over the interests and rights and freedoms of that person within the meaning of Article 21(1) of the GDPR, which it is for the controller to demonstrate [\u2026]\u201d. CJEU - C-200/23 - Agentsia po vpisvaniyata , margin number 120. It should be noted that the data subject can (in accordance with Article 18(1)(d) GDPR ) request the restriction of the personal data during the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject (see commentary on Article 18 GDPR ). Data must also be erased when an objection to direct marketing [ 27 ] has been submitted under Article 21(2) GDPR . The objection under Article 21(2) GDPR is not subject to a balancing test with the interests of the controller. [ 28 ] However, if the same data is used for other purposes, that processing will still be possible, provided that there is another applicable legal basis. A confirmation to this can be found in Article 21(3) GDPR , under which, in case of objection to direct marketing, \" personal data shall no longer be processed for such purposes \". This means that erasure will also be excluded when other lawful purposes are pursued by the controller. [ 29 ] For example: An energy provider used its customer's contact information to advertise additional products to the customer. After the data subject's objection to the processing for marketing purposes ( Article 21(2) GDPR ), the controller can, in accordance with Article 21(3) GDPR continue to process the contact information for the purposes of the performance of the contract. According to a different view, data subjects can request the deletion of their personal data under Article 17(1)(c) GDPR after an objection in accordance with Article 21(2) GDPR even if their data is processed for a different purpose. [ 30 ] Only in the cases listed in Article 17(3) GDPR could the controller reject such an erasure request, even if that would seem like a contradiction with Article 21(3) GDPR that only precludes the processing of the respective data for marketing purposes. Under Article 17(1)(d) GDPR, data must be erased in case they have been unlawfully processed . This ground for deletion is closely linked to the principle of lawfulness in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR . According to this principle, the processing of personal data can be considered to be lawful, when it can be based on one of the legal bases in Article 6(1) GDPR . [ 31 ] \"[Article 6(1) GDPR] sets out an exhaustive and restrictive list of the cases in which processing of personal data can be regarded as lawful. Thus, in order to be capable of being regarded as such, processing must fall within one of the cases provided for in that provision [...].\" CJEU - C\u201126/22 and C\u201164/22 - SCHUFA Holding and Others (Discharge from remaining debts) (Joined Cases) , margin number 73. However, Chapter II of the GDPR entails some provisions further clarifying the controller's obligations under Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6(1) GDPR; therefore, the controller has to comply with this provisions as well in order for the processing to be lawful. [ 32 ] In particular these provisions are Article 7 and 8 GDPR which have a direct effect on the validity of consent under Article 6(1)(a ) GDPR and Article 9 and 10 GDPR which provide for additional requirements for lawful processing. [ 33 ] A similar argument could be made regarding Article 22(2) GDPR which similarly provides for additional requirements for automated individual decision making. [ 34 ] Therefore, the ground for erasure in Article 17(1)(d) GDPR applies in case the processing of personal data cannot be based on any of the legal bases provided for in Article 6(1) GDPR , or (if applicable) the additional requirements under Article 9 or 10 GDPR are not met. Other violations of the GDPR do not, per so, lead to this ground for erasure. E.g. a violation against the obligation to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures, in accordance with Article 32 GDPR , does not by itself lead to the controller's obligation to (and the data subjects right to demand to) delete the affected personal data. However, other violations can have an effect on the legal basis itself and can lead to unlawful processing. [ 35 ] For example, a violation of the information obligation could exclude the controller's invocation of an legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR as a legal basis. [ 36 ] \"[Articles 17(1)(d) and 18(1)(b) GDPR] must be read in conjunction with Article 5(1) of that regulation, according to which processing of personal data must comply with a number of principles which are set out in that provision, including that set out in Article 5(1)(a) of that regulation, which specifies that personal data is to be processed \u2018lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject\u2019. [\u2026] It should be noted that the lawfulness of processing is precisely the subject, as is apparent from its actual title, of Article 6 of the GDPR, which provides that processing is to be lawful only if at least one of the conditions set out in points (a) to (f) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of that article is met [\u2026] That list of cases in which the processing of personal data may be regarded as lawful is exhaustive and restrictive, so that, in order that it can be regarded as lawful, processing must fall within one of the cases provided for in the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR [\u2026]. Furthermore, in so far as Articles 7 to 11 of the GDPR, which appear, like Articles 5 and 6 thereof, in Chapter II of that regulation, which chapter relates to principles, are intended to clarify the scope of the data controller\u2019s obligations under Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6(1) of that regulation, the processing of personal data, in order to be lawful, must also comply, as is apparent from the Court\u2019s case-law, with those other provisions of that chapter which concern, in essence, consent, processing of special categories of sensitive personal data and processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences [\u2026] It follows, therefore, from the actual wording of Article 5(1)(a) and the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR that infringement by the controller of the obligations laid down in Articles 26 [i.e. conclusion of a joint controller ship agreement] and 30 [maintaining a record of processing activities] of that regulation does not constitute \u2018unlawful processing\u2019 within the meaning of Article 17(1)(d) and Article 18(1)(b) of that regulation, which would stem from the controller\u2019s infringement of the principle of \u2018accountability\u2019 as set out in Article 5(2) of that regulation.\" CJEU - C-60/22 - Bundesrepublik Deutschland (Court electronic mailbox) , margin number 50 et seqq. Generally, the processing of inaccurate personal data will hardly be necessary for a processing activity based on one of the legal bases in Article 6(1) GDPR and will not be covered by the data subject's respective consent. Therefore inaccurate personal data will also be subject to this ground for erasure (in parallel to the data subject's possibility to request its rectification). [ 37 ] While the provision states that this ground for erasure applies when the personal data \"have been unlawfully processed\", it should be pointed out that the relevant point in time is the present. If the processing of personal data was unlawful in the beginning but later became lawful, the erasure can no longer be requested by the data subject. [ 38 ] For example: A controller first obtained the data subject's invalid consent to process its personal data. Later it mends the complaint by obtaining the valid consent of the data subject. Even though the personal data was first processed unlawfully, the personal data does not have to be deleted since it can now be based on a legal basis. It should be noted that in case the processing is unlawful, the data subject can also request the restriction of processing if they oppose the erasure. In this case the controller must not delete the data (see commentary on Article 18 GDPR ). Personal data have to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation under Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject. This provision contains an opening clause by which legal obligations are left to the discretion of Member States. Hence, additional cases which would justify the erasure of data can be introduced at a national level. The opening clause does not impose any special requirements on the respective Member State regulation. However, it is necessary that the respective Member State regulation does not undermine the requirements of the GDPR and, above all, does not violate any rights under the Charter or fundamental freedoms. [ 39 ] The respective provision in Union or Member State law must be an obligation to which the controller is subject. Contractual deletion duties are not sufficient for this erasure clause to apply. [ 40 ] Personal data must also be erased if they have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8(1) GDPR . Article 8(1) GDPR provides for conditions for a child's consent in relation to such information society services (see Commentary on Article 8(1) GDPR for those conditions and for the definition of information society services). This provision is meant to ensure a more thorough protective scheme for children, who enjoy increased protection under the GDPR. Recital 65 GDPR, in particular, establishes a reason for this provision, stating that where the data subject has given their consent as a child, and are not fully aware of the risks involved in the processing operations, they may want to remove such personal data, especially on the internet.  Data subjects should be able to exercise that right notwithstanding the fact that they are no longer children. [ 41 ] With that being said, the scope of this provision must be clarified. A strict literal interpretation would lead to the conclusion that every personal data of minors collected by an information society service [ 42 ] must always and in any case be deleted. Such conclusion would make little sense because, under certain conditions, Article 8(1) GDPR allows for the processing of such personal data. [ 43 ] Therefore, an alternative interpretation that is in line with the structure of Article 17 and, more generally, of the GDPR, should be provided. In this perspective, the scope of this provision consists of the revocation of a previously given (valid) [ 44 ] consent under Article 8(1) of the GDPR. If such consent is revoked, the data must be removed. Compared to the \"classic\" consent revocation case under Article 17(1)(a) GDPR, the distinction is that in these cases the deletion of the data occurs even if there are, in theory, other legal bases for further processing. [ 45 ] Moreover, following the indications of Recital 65, the request remains valid especially when the data subject is no longer a minor. In other words, it is a reinforced right to erasure that, on the one hand, excludes hypotheses of further processing due to additional legal bases other than consent and, on the other hand, allows the data subject to remove personal data disseminated on the internet and generally made available by data subjects during their childhood, potentially without realising the importance and consequences of their actions. [ 46 ] The obligations imposed on the controller by Article 17(2) GDPR are designed to provide greater recognition to the right to be forgotten on the Internet (Recital 66). This right addresses the issue that arises when data is published on the Internet and later stored and republished by other controllers. This can occur automatically, as in the case of the \"Internet Archive\" organisation, which records the content of websites and makes them available to the public. Additionally, search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo often display links to data published on the Internet. Even if data is deleted from one website, it may still be accessible and linked on other websites, resulting in the commonly used phrase \" the Internet never forgets \". In such cases, the erasure by just \"one\" controller under Article 17(1) GDPR is clearly ineffective. Thus, the right to be forgotten seeks measures that go beyond deleting the data at a single controller, in order to stop or reduce uncontrolled dissemination of data which in theory should be erased. [ 47 ] This is why, according to Article 17(2) GDPR, the controller must take reasonable steps to inform other controllers which process the personal data that the data subjects want deleted. Two requirements must be met for Article 17(2) GDPR to apply: First, the controller has made the personal data public and second, the controller is obligated to delete the personal data in accordance with Article 17(1) GDPR. If that is the case, the controller must take suitable measures, including technical ones, based on available technology and implementation costs, to inform other controllers who have received the personal data that the data subject has requested the erasure of all links, copies or replications of the affected personal data. This obligation has some similarities but should not be mixed up with the controller's obligation under Article 19 GDPR to notify any recipients of personal data in case the controller had to erase personal data in accordance with Article 17(1) GDPR. In contrast to Article 17(2) GDPR, the notification obligation in Article 19 GDPR is not only applicable in case the personal data was published. Compared to disclosing personal data to specific but possibly numerous recipients, the act of making personal data public is characterised by the indeterminate nature of the number of recipients. Therefore, a strict sense of publication should be excluded if the controller adopts tools that restrict the number of recipients, such as using passwords or other access protection tools. The text of the regulation also clarifies that the act of publication must be intentional. Therefore, hacker attacks or accidental publications related to possible data breaches are not covered by this provision. [ 48 ] For example: In case a controller discloses personal data on its website which is accessible to everyone since the controller did not implement any access restrictions, the personal data can be considered published. However, it is not necessary, that the publication was done by disclosing the information on the internet. Also a publication by other means can fulfill this requirement. [ 49 ] The obligation in Article 17(2) GDPR applies only in cases where one of the grounds for erasure in Article 17(1) GDPR applies (see above for information on those conditions). However, while Article 17(1) GDPR also provides for an obligation of the controller to delete data irrespective of a request from the data subject, it is argued that for the information obligation in Article 17(2) GDPR to apply, a respective request must be made by the data subject. [ 50 ] The controller is obligated to take reasonable measures to inform other controllers and data processors who are processing the relevant data about the data subject's request for deletion. This means that the controller must inform an indefinite number of recipients, who are or may be unknown to the controller. [ 51 ] The controller is only obliged to take reasonable measures (see below on the assessment of appropriate measures); therefore, the controller is not obliged to individually contact each controller which is processing the respective personal data. [ 52 ] The appropriateness of the measures to be taken is determined taking into account available technology and implementation costs. In many cases, it may be impossible or impractical for the controller to make direct contact with all recipients, which may go beyond a \" reasonable measure \" because of the effort involved. [ 53 ] In these cases, the controller may consider alternative methods, such as providing information on their website or publishing the request for deletion at the point where the data was first published. These methods may be less effective, but they are still acceptable under the regulation. [ 54 ] Common mistake: It is worth emphasising that while it may be \"reasonable\" to not require the controller to make \"unreasonable\" efforts to contact \"all\" controllers, it is also reasonable to expect that such efforts should still be made in simpler situations. For example, if a well-known online newspaper publishes false news about a data subject's arrest and the news spreads to numerous national and international outlets, the data subject may request that the first newspaper delete the news. After removing the page from its website and publishing a correction, the first newspaper can at least directly inform the major news outlets where the news appeared. In fact, it is very simple to verify, at least within the narrow circle of \"national\" newspapers, who has published the news. For all other controllers who are not easily reachable, the simple publication of the correction is sufficient. The provision also allows for the possibility that the measures taken to inform data processors of the data subject's request for deletion may \"also be of a technical nature\". This may include the use of technical measures such as meta tags on the website where the deleted information was previously located, in order to prompt search engine web crawlers to delete the relevant data from their index files and caches. Similar techniques to Digital Rights Management (DRM) used in electronic media could also be considered, although their effectiveness and feasibility in enforcing the \"right to be forgotten\" are sometimes debated. [ 55 ] The controller who has received the erasure request must inform the other controllers which are processing the personal data that the data subject has requested the erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data. In this context, the term \" link \" refers to any reference to a storage location where the data subject's information is stored, including links that lead to a different storage location of the data than the original publication. The use of the terms \" copy \" and \" replication \" indicates that not only exact copies, but also reproductions from which data or even parts of the data can be extracted, must be deleted (for example, screenshots). [ 56 ] The GDPR does not provide that controllers have to require such erasure and does not provide a specific mechanism by which controllers could require such erasure. [ 57 ] While the title of Article 17 (\" Right to be forgotten \") may leave a different impression, Article 17(2) does not create an independent obligation on these other controllers to delete the data. Rather, these other controllers are only required to delete the data if one of the reasons for erasure set out in Article 17(1) GDPR applies to them. [ 58 ] It is important to keep in mind that third parties might be in a different position when processing the data which they have obtained through the controller. E.g. it is possible that a different controller that has obtained personal data because it were made public by another controller but it processes the data on the basis of a different legal basis and for a different purpose; therefore the erasure ground applying to the controller making the data public might not apply to the different controller processing the published data. [ 59 ] Finally, according to the EDPB, this obligation of information does not apply to search engine providers when they find information containing personal data published or placed on the internet by third parties, index it automatically, store it temporarily and make it available to internet users according to a particular order of preference. In addition, \"it does not require search engine providers, who have received a data subject\u2019s delisting request, to inform the third party which made public that information on the internet. Such obligation seeks to give greater responsibility to original controllers and try to prevent from multiplying data subjects\u2019 initiatives.\u201d [ 60 ] It is important to point out the differences to Article 19 GDPR , which foresees the communication of any erasure of personal data to each recipient to whom the personal data had been disclosed (unless this proves impossible or entails disproportionate effort), as well as informing the data subject about those recipients if requested. Recital 66 GDPR clearly states that this addition is meant to \" strengthen the right to be forgotten in the online environment \", although it is not limited to this kind of processing (see Commentary on Article 19 GDPR for more information). If processing is required for the purposes listed in Article 17(3)(a-e), the right to erasure and to be forgotten under Article17(1) and (2) does not apply. The list of exceptions provided in 17(3) is comprehensive and final. The requirement of necessity implies that the processing should be restricted to what is essential for the given purposes. The refusal of the erasure is only allowed to the extent that processing is necessary for the reasons below. This means that a data subject may exercise the right to erasure when the processing is no longer necessary, or when it is carried out at a level beyond what is necessary. In any case, controllers bear the burden of demonstrating and proving that any exception that they may rely on is applicable. [ 61 ] Article 17(3)(a) GDPR provides an exception to the right to erasure if the processing is necessary for exercising the right to freedom of expression and information . This exception is therefore closely connected to the freedom of expression and information under Article 11 CFR . [ 62 ] This exception reflects one of the most common balancing tests that not only courts but also many data protection authorities have been called upon to implement. When attempting to strike a balance between data protection and freedom of expression, the following two factors need to be taken into consideration: first, the nature of information in question and its sensitivity for the data subject\u2019s private life, and second, the public\u2019s interest in accessing the information, which may vary depending on the data subject\u2019s role in public life. [ 63 ] Results may vary from case to case, but when the data is about a public figure or about the professional life of a well-know individual, the argument for refusing erasure in favour of freedom of expression and information is particularly strong, unless the information that the data subject wants to erase is completely unrelated to their role in society. Article 85(1) GDPR is relevant here: \"Member States shall, by law, reconcile the right to the protection of personal data pursuant to this Regulation with the right to freedom of expression and information, including processing for journalistic purposes and the purposes of academic, artistic or literary expression.\" It is important to take into consideration that, according to Recital 153 GDPR, \u201cin order to take account of the importance of the right to freedom of expression in every democratic society, it is necessary to interpret notions relating to that freedom, such as journalism, broadly.\u201d According to Voigt and von dem Bussche, \u201cthis exception might become highly relevant in practice as this right cannot only be invoked by the press but also by any entity\u201d , as well as any individual. [ 64 ] Scholars point out that, under this exception, the deletion of opinions should not be allowed. However, distinguishing between personal data and opinion can be challenging when an opinion is based on personal data. In such cases, it is necessary to weigh whether the personal data underlying the opinion is still necessary. The older the personal data, the less likely it is to be necessary for forming an opinion. [ 65 ] Article 17(3)(b) GDPR provides for an exemption from the controller's obligation to erase personal data in case the data is necessary for the processing on the basis of Article 6(1)(c) and (e) GDPR . This exemption can therefore be considered as containing two parts (see Commentary on these provisions for more information). The first part provides an exception to the right to erasure if processing is necessary for fulfilling a legal obligation under Union or Member State law that applies to the data controller. These situations refer to the grounds of processing contained in Article 6(1)(c) GDPR . The legal obligation must result from objective, sufficiently clear and foreseeable law in the public interest (not necessarily in the area of \u200b\u200bdata protection). [ 66 ] In these cases, the controller shall provide the data subject with the legal grounds for retaining their data. Such obligations are particularly common for retention- and documentation obligations, e.g. in tax law. [ 67 ] For example: A common instance of such compliance with a legal obligation is compliance with national commercial or tax laws which may require the retention and processing of personal data. Article 17(3) GDPR, second part, rules out the erasure when processing of personal data is necessary to carry out a task in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority, as provided for under Article 6(1)(e) GDPR . This exception covers processing activities, such as international data transfers between competition, tax, or customs authorities, financial supervisory authorities, or services responsible for social security or public health matters. [ 68 ] Article 17(3)(c) GDPR establishes an exception for the processing of personal data necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health. This affects processing based on the exemption to process special categories of personal data in Article 9(2)(h) and (i) as well as in Article 9(3) GDPR (see Commentary on these provisions for more information on them). Therefore, the controller is not obliged to delete personal data even in case one of the grounds for erasure in Article 17(1) GDPR applies, in case the processing is necessary for the purposes listed in Article 9(2)(h) GPDR (e.g. for preventive or occupational medicine or the assessment of the working capacity of employees) based on Union or Member State law or a contract with a health professional subject to professional secrecy. Similarly, the exemption applies in case the processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health in accordance with Article 9(2)(i) GDPR . Article 17(3)(d) GDPR provides an exemption from the controller's erasure obligation in case that processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes under Article 89(1) GDPR. A requirement for this exemption to apply is that the erasure of the data would make the objectives of that processing impossible or seriously impair its achievement. This provision is therefore similar to the exemption from the prohibition of processing special categories of personal data in Article 9(2)(j) GDPR which contains an exception for those purposes (see commentary on Article 9(2)(j) GDPR for more information). For example: The deletion of personal data could seriously impair the achievement of the purposes of a study in case such deletion would significantly reduce the statistical validity of the study. [ 69 ] Article 17(3)(d) GDPR provides an exemption from the controller's erasure obligation in case that processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. This provision mirrors Article 9(2)(f) GDPR and is supposed to prevent data subjects from demanding an erasure of their personal data that is relevant for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. The legal claims this provision refers to include both public and private law claims. It should also be noted that these legal claims must be either already filed and underway, or at the very least imminent or impending, and not just a hypothetical possibility. [ 70 ] It should be recalled that Article 12(5) GDPR provides for circumstances in which a controller can refuse to act on a request (i.e. in case a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive). However, when the requirement of one of the grounds for erasure in Article 17(1) GDPR is applicable, it is unlikely one of those reasons to refuse to act on a request could be applicable. Article 23 GDPR provides for the option to impose restrictions on the right to erasure under Article 17 GDPR (see commentary on Articles 12 - 15 GDPR). It is important to note that while Article 17 GDPR is limited to certain situations any data subject can bring a complaint under Article 77 GDPR if \" the data subject considers that the processing of personal data relating to him or her infringes this Regulation \" and Article 79 GDPR grants a right to a judicial remedy against a controller or processor \" where he or she considers that his or her rights under this Regulation have been infringed as a result of the processing of his or her personal data in non-compliance with this Regulation \". The available legal remedy is therefore capturing many other situations where processing violates the GDPR. This means that while the right to erasure is limited to certain situations under Article 17 GDPR, data subjects are not confined to the ground in Article 17 GDPR when bringing remedies against unlawful processing activities. However, while Article 17 GDPR generally foresees the deletion of the affected personal data, processing activities violating the GDPR can also be remedied in other ways, i.e. they can generally be brought into compliance with the GDPR. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 17 GDPR \u2191 Regularly, Article 17 GDPR is interpreted in encompassing to rights; first the classical right to erasure under paragraph 1 and the right to be forgotten in paragraph 2; see Kamann, Braun , in Ehmann, Selmayr, DS-GVO, Article 17 GDPR, margin number 1 et seqq.

Such a situation may arise, for instance, when data relating to the data subject is collected during the use of an app and processed in pseudonymised form for the further development of the app. In this case, in the event of an objection by the data subject, the controller would not be able to demonstrate any compelling legitimate grounds that would allow further processing, because the app can continue to be operated without the data of the data subject. On the other hand, it is likely that the controller has an overriding legitimate interest (the technical development of the app), which, depending on the design of the processing operations, could exclude the data subject's claim for deletion.

This includes data held for political canvassing and charitable fundraising purposes, as direct marketing encompasses any targeted communication that promotes an organization's goals and values.

Where processing has been restricted under paragraph 1, such personal data shall, with the exception of storage, only be processed with the data subject's consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the Union or of a Member State. 3.   A data subject who has obtained restriction of processing pursuant to paragraph 1 shall be informed by the controller before the restriction of processing is lifted. Article 18 GDPR provides for the right of the data subject to request the restriction of processing from the controller which processes their personal data. Restriction of processing is defined in Article 4(3) GDPR and means \" the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future \". Therefore, the data subject can \u2013in the cases listed in Article 18(1) GDPR\u2013 request that the controller stops the processing of their data but does not yet delete it. Since due to a restriction of processing the data is not used anymore for the purpose intended by the controller, the right to restriction is closely related to the right to erasure, under Article 17 GDPR. [ 1 ] The restriction of processing is applicable in cases where the controller would generally be obliged to delete the respective personal data but the data subject has an interest in the continuous storage of its data, and in cases where the assessment of an erasure request needs some time, during which, the processing should be restricted. [ 2 ] In other words, the right to restriction of processing allows data subjects to temporarily request the limitation of the types of processing operations that a controller can perform on their personal data in order to avoid the potential deletion of data they still need or the potential processing of disputed data in a way that could harm them. In such case, the controller is only allowed to passively store the personal data, but can no longer share, disclose, erase, or perform any other type of processing operation on them. The personal data gets \"frozen\", unless any of the specific exceptions under paragraph 2 applies. The right to restriction of processing only applies during a limited period (the \u201crestriction period\u201d ), at the end of which the controller is no longer bound to limit the processing. The length of this restriction period will vary from one case to another. Like other rights of the data subject, Article 18 GDPR must be read in conjunction with Article 12 GDPR , which provides for formal rules and modalities. In case Article 18 GDPR applies, the controller also has an obligation to inform recipients about the restriction of the affected personal data in accordance with Article 19 GDPR . Article 18(1) GDPR lists the situations in which a data subject can request the rectification of its data from the controller. Article 18(2) GDPR provides for exemptions in which the processing of restricted data by the controller is still justified. Finally, Article 18(3) GDPR stipulates that the data subject has to be informed before the controller lifts the restriction of processing. The right to restriction of processing can be invoked by the data subjects in four different situations: the accuracy of personal data is contested (Article 18(1)(a) GDPR); the personal data should be erased since it is processed unlawfully, but the data subject opposes its erasure (Article 18(1)(b) GDPR); the data should be erased since its purpose has been achieved but the data subject opposes the erasure since personal data are needed for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims (Article 18(1)(c) GDPR); and the data subject has objected to the processing under Article 21 GDPR and requests restriction while the legitimate interests assessment is carried out (Article 18(1)(d) GDPR). Article 18(1)(a) and (d) GDPR are characterised by the existence of an ongoing request by the data subject relating to the processing of the personal data. I.e., the accuracy of the personal data is contested under Article 16 GDPR or the data subject objected to the processing under Article 21 GDPR . In that case, Article 18 GDPR offers data subjects the possibility to temporarily require controllers to restrict the processing of their inaccurate personal data, pending its rectification. This mitigates immediate risks caused by the continuous processing of inaccurate personal data. On the other hand, Article 18(1)(b) and (c) GDPR applies to cases in which there is an obligation by the controller to delete the data subject's personal data\u2013since the data are processed unlawfully or the data are no longer needed for the purpose of the processing\u2013but the data subject opposes the deletion and instead requests restriction. In such cases the data subject would also have a right to request the deletion of the data; therefore, the data subject has the right to choose whether they want to demand the restriction or deletion of the data. [ 3 ] The right to restriction only applies in case (at least) one of the specific circumstances outlined in Article 18(a) to (d) GDPR applies to the processing at hand. In any case, the data subject is required to make a request to the controller in which they have to demand the restriction of the processing and should already refer to the particular ground for restriction in Article 18(1) GDPR they refer to. [ 4 ] In particular, in order for a right to restriction under Article 18(1)(a) and (d) GDPR to apply, the data subject needs to either contest the accuracy or object to the processing respectively. This can be done prior to the request to restrict the processing or in course of the same request. In case of Article Article 18(1)(b) and (c) GDPR, the data subjects needs to oppose the erasure of the processing or declare that they need the data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. [ 5 ] That said, similar to the exercise of the right to rectification and erasure, the rules set out in Article 12 GDPR apply to the right to restriction; in particular, to the the submission of a request, including the obligation to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights ( Article 12(2) and (3) GDPR ), inform the data subject about the measures taken ( Article 12(3) and (4) GDPR ), the right to receive this service free of charge ( Article 12(5) GDPR ) and the procedure for verifying the identity of the data subject in case of doubts ( Articles 11 and Article 12(6) GDPR ). The obligation to facilitate the exercise of the right to restriction means that a controller should not simply reject a request for restriction which does not refer to a particular ground for restriction. Rather the controller should ask the data subject to clarify their request. Similarly, the controller should do its best to determine the true intention of the data subject's request. For example: A controller is processing the personal data of a data subject based on its legitimate interest and receives an objection by the data subject referring to Article 18(1)(d) GDPR but not explicitly objecting to the processing. The controller should not reject the request on the grounds that due to the absence of an objection  the conditions are not met. Rather, the controller should understand the request of the data subject as including an objection against the processing activity. The controller's obligation to provide information on the action taken without undue delay (and in any event withing one month, with the possibility of an extention by two more months in exceptional circumstances) means that the rectification needs to be performed as soon as possible (See commentary on Article 12(3) GDPR ). The immediate reaction of the controller is particularly important in the case of the right to restriction, due to the restriction\u2019s purpose. If not acted on upon quickly, there is the immense danger that the controller complies with its erasure obligation and deletes the affected data ( Article 18(1)(b) and (c) GDPR ). Similarly, the right to rectification during the assessment of the accuracy or an objection would be inefficient, if the affected data is not restricted quickly ( Article 18(1)(b) and (c) GDPR ). [ 6 ] In these cases, the right to rectification provides for a sort of preliminary remedy which can only be effective if complied with immediately by the controller. In accordance with Article 4(3) GDPR , \" restriction of processing \" means \" the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future \". According to Recital 67 GDPR, methods to restrict the processing of personal data include temporarily moving the selected data to another processing system, making the selected personal data unavailable to users, or temporarily removing published data from a website. In automated filing systems, the restriction of processing should be ensured by technical means in such a manner that the personal data are not subject to further processing operations and cannot be changed. In particular, the fact that the processing of personal data is restricted should clearly be indicated in the system. In case of automated processing, marking the data records as \"blocked\" is sufficient only insofar the software accessing the marked data is able to recognise that only permitted processing operations under Article 18(2) are possible. [ 7 ] In case of non-automated filing systems, the restriction can be achieved by sorting the affected data out of the filing system, keeping them separated and ensuring that the data cannot be used for purposes other than those listed in Article 18(2) GDPR. [ 8 ] The right to restriction of processing can be effectively exercised by data subjects when one of the following grounds for restriction applies: Article 18(1)(a) GDPR provides for a ground for restriction of the processing in case the data subject contests the accuracy of the personal data. Generally, the contestation of the accuracy of the personal data will be done by the data subject with a rectification request, under Article 16 GDPR . But the data subject could also bring up the inaccuracy of the data in the course of a deletion request, under Article 17 GDPR . Of course, the accuracy of the data can also be contested in the restriction request itself. [ 9 ] However, the contestation of the accuracy is sufficient; it is not necessary that the data are objectively inaccurate. [ 10 ] The duration of the restriction under this provision is limited to the period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data. [ 11 ] The reason for this ground for restriction is that the rectification of personal data can take a variable period of time depending on the nature and amount of data, the diligence of the controller, etc. [ 12 ] While awaiting the controller's assessment of the accuracy of their personal data (and its rectification), data subjects may want to protect themselves from any adverse effect linked to the processing of their inaccurate data by restricting the type of operations that the controller can still perform on them. Thus, the right to restriction of processing may be exercised after or in parallel to the right to rectification. For example, if a data subject notices that a controller is processing inaccurate personal data and that this may have an adverse effect on them (e.g. inaccurate bank account details which may lead to wrongful money transfers), they may simultaneously invoke Article 16 GDPR (right to rectification) and Article 18 GDPR (right to restriction) in order to request the controller to suspend the processing the personal data until the data has been corrected. In case the controller's assessment does not provide a clear result regarding the accuracy ( non-liquet ), the controller should delete the affected personal data pursuant to its responsibility to demonstrate the accuracy of the data in accordance with Article 5(1)(d) and Article 5(2) GDPR . [ 13 ] Article 18(1)(b) GDPR provides for the right to restriction in case a controller is processing personal data unlawfully, [ 14 ] but the data subject requests restriction of the processing instead of the erasure of the personal data to which the controller would be obliged (and the data subject would have a right to) under Article 17 GDPR . While the wording of Article 18(1)(b) GDPR suggests that the data subject needs to oppose the erasure, this should not be understood as requiring a separate declaration since this should already be clear enough due to the restriction request. In case it is unclear (e.g. the data subject requests both, the deletion and the restriction), the controller should contact the data subject in order to determine their free will (in the meantime the data can be restricted). [ 15 ] The data subject does not have to justify their choice to request the restriction rather than the deletion, rather they can choose freely between these options in case of unlawful processing. [ 16 ] In such a case, the purpose of exercising the right conferred by Article 18 GDPR is to interrupt the unlawful processing operation whilst also preventing the data controller from erasing the personal data. The data subjects may want to oppose the erasure of their personal data for different reasons, including the fact that they still need (a copy) for their personal use. It might also be the case that the personal data constitute important evidence of the unlawful processing itself (e.g. health data which were collected without the consent of the data subject). An important case could also be that the data subject wants to prevent the controller from re-collecting their data after the deletion and therefore preventing the commencement of a processing activity at a later time. [ 17 ] However, it is disputed whether the restriction of personal data under this ground can only be temporary or whether the data subject can also request the restriction for an indefinite time. [ 18 ] If a controller is obliged to delete unlawfully processed personal data on its own initiative and without the knowledge of the data subject, it is disputed whether the controller should inform the data subject accordingly in order to enable them to exercise their right to restriction. [ 19 ] Article 18(1)(c) GPDR provides for a ground for the restriction of processing in case the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but the data are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. In other words, Article 18(1)(c) GPDR  applies when the purpose of the processing has been achieved and the personal data undergoing the processing should be deleted in accordance with Article 17(1)(a) GDPR , but the data subject opposes the erasure since the information is needed for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. Similar to Article 18(1)(b) GDPR, this provision offers the possibility for data subjects to prevent the erasure of their personal data by the controller even if the controller would otherwise be obliged to delete the data under Article 17(1)(a) GDPR . [ 20 ] Regularly, it will be challenging for the data subject to anticipate that the purpose of the processing is/was achieved; particularly, in case the controller complies with its deletion obligation in time. The data subject is often unaware of this circumstance, and their data may be deleted without giving them the opportunity to exercise their right. To address this, the controller could inform the data subject when the purpose of the processing has been achieved to facilitate the exercise of their right under Article 12(2) GDPR . However, it is disputed whether the controller is obliged to do so. [ 21 ] In contrast to Article 18(1)(b) GDPR, it is a requirement that the data subject actually needs the information for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. A mere abstract chance that the data subject might need the information at some point is not sufficient. [ 22 ] The restriction period should normally last until the data subject has been able to retrieve a copy of the relevant data, or until the legal claims are established, exercised or defended; it is also argued that the controller might submit a copy of the data instead of further processing the information for the data subject. [ 23 ] For example: Following the end of a work relationship, a data subject exercises their right to restriction of processing in order to prevent his prior employer from erasing personal data that are needed for his defence in the context of an action relating to unpaid wages or abusive dismissal. The fourth and last ground for the restriction of processing (Article 18(1)(d) GDPR) concerns situations where a data subject has objected to the processing of personal data on the basis of Article 21(1) GDPR . Under that provision, the data subject can object, on grounds relating to their particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning them which is based on Article 6(1)(e) or (f) GDPR . [ 24 ] In such a case, the controller can no longer process the affected personal data unless it can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject. Such an assessment requires a balancing test (see Commentary on Article 21 GDPR ) during which the data subject can demand the restriction of the processing in accordance with Article 18(1)(d) GDPR. In other words, pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject (including the assessment whether the data is needed for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims), the data subject can also rely on this provision to force the controller to limit the processing of personal data to the purposes listed in Article 18(2) GDPR (i.e. the passive storage), pending a final decision on the underlying objection. [ 25 ] For example: An insurance company could decide to monitor and collect information about insured persons who are suspected of insurance fraud based on the company's legitimate interests. In case of an objection to that processing activity by the data subject due to reasons relating to their particular situation, the controller must assess whether it has compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which overrides the data subjects interests, rights and freedoms. For this ground for the restriction of processing to apply, it is not required that the interests of the data subjects actually override the interests of the controller, rather the mere claim by the data subject (combined with the request to restrict the data) is sufficient. [ 26 ] This balancing exercise, which is incumbent on the controller, may nonetheless lead to discrepancies in opinions. If a dispute ensues, it will ultimately be for the competent data protection authority or national court to determine whether the objection was justified. However, this may take a more or less long period of time during which the data subjects may suffer harm. Hence, Article 18 GDPR may prove to be particularity useful in those instances since it confers data subjects the right to request the controller to also temporarily restrict the processing of their personal data, pending a final decision by the controller or, potentially, a court. [ 27 ] Once activated, Article 18 GDPR places a dual obligation on the controller during the restriction period: (i) the obligation to store the personal data; and (ii) the obligation not to perform any other operation on the restricted data. The obligation not to process the personal data in any other way than storage may nevertheless be tempered if either of the following exceptions apply. It should be noted that the exemptions from the restrictions should be interpreted restrictively and that they should only be invoked if the restricted data are necessary for the purposes described below. [ 28 ] The controller is under the burden to proof to demonstrate that one the exemptions apply. [ 29 ] A controller subject to a restriction obligation may still perform other processing operations than storage when this has been specifically allowed by the data subject by giving their consent. In other words, data subjects can consent to the processing of their personal data beyond passive storage after having exercised their right to restriction of processing under Article 18 GDPR. For example: A data subject invokes Article 18 GDPR upon closing a bank account, in order to ensure that the bank does not delete important financial information relating to money transfers made in the last two preceding years and they reqire this information for the exercise of legal claims. However, the data subject may in parallel consent to the bank deleting data which are older than two years or to process some data for a particular other purpose. The data subject can give their consent at the same time they request the restriction of processing, or later. A consent given by the data subject prior to the restriction request (e.g. when the original legal basis for the processing was consent) should not be considered as such an exemption by the controller. [ 30 ] In case the controller is obliged to restrict the processing of personal data due to a respective request by the data subject, it may still process the data (besides its passive storage) insofar as this is required for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims (see Commentary on Article 18(1)(d) GDPR for information on legal claims). This exception may of course become problematic when unduly or excessively relied on by controllers. By invoking it, controllers can indeed easily defeat the very purpose of the right to restriction of processing, which was to provide data subjects with an easy and quick way to alleviate the immediate risks pertaining to the processing of personal data. However, a controller may incur a fine if it wrongfully relies on that exception, in accordance with Article 83(5) GDPR . A controller under the obligation to restrict the processing of personal data due to a respective request by the data subject may also process the affected data (besides its passive storage) insofar as this is required for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person. Another natural or legal person refers to someone who is neither the data subject nor the controller. [ 31 ] Also this exception may become problematic when unduly or excessively relied on by controllers, as already explained above. Therefore, the controller should perform a careful assessment whether the processing for the protection of rights of others is necessary and appropriate, [ 32 ] and the exemption should be interpreted restrictively. [ 33 ] A fine under Article 83(5) GDPR is also possible in this case. A controller under the obligation to restrict the processing of personal data due to a respective request by the data subject may also process the affected data (besides its passive storage) for reasons of important public interest of the Union or of a Member State. In contrast to Article 23(1)(e) GDPR , which sets out strict requirements for the Union or Member State's law restricting GDPR rights, Article 18(2) GDPR does not make any reference to the law and merely refers to the public interest. The list under Article 23 GDPR is however useful to delineate a definition of \"public interest\", among the others, national security, defence, public security, law enforcement and important economic or financial interests of the Union or of a Member State, such as monetary, budgetary, taxation, public health, social security and independence of the judiciary. Moreover, the GDPR acknowledges various other public interests. These may include public archival purposes, public scientific or historical research, or statistical purposes ( Article 89 GDPR ), as well as the protection of public health ( Article 9(2)(h) GDPR ), public access to official documents ( Article 86 GDPR ), and more. In these cases, a greater public interest must be demonstrated through a comprehensive balancing of interests. [ 34 ] This makes it all the more important to have a restrictive interpretation of the provision, which results in a directly applicable limitation of the data subject's right to data protection. [ 35 ] A controller may incur a fine if it wrongfully relies on this exception, in accordance with Article 83(5) GDPR . Finally, Article 18(3) GDPR specifies that a data subject who has obtained restriction of processing must be informed by the controller before the restriction of processing is lifted. This should provide the data subject with the possibility to oppose the stop of the restriction, for example, if the latter considers that the underlying request, claim or objection has not been properly addressed or solved or the data are still needed for legal claims. The controller should therefore give the data subject an appropriate amount of time to react to the information. [ 36 ] Furthermore, granting restriction of processing imposes on the controller the obligation to notify any recipients to whom the personal data have been disclosed about the restriction, so that they can themselves adapt the processing of personal data to what is allowed and required. [ 37 ] However, recipients are not directly obliged to restrict the personal data as well. See Article 19 GDPR for more information on this notification obligation. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 18 GDPR \u2191 Herbst , in K\u00fchling, Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 18 GDPR, margin numbers 1 (C.H.

Unless this proves impossible 3.2.2 Or involves disproportionate effort 3.3 Information Obligation Towards the Data Subject 3.4 Member State Restrictions 4 Decisions 5 References The controller shall communicate any rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing carried out in accordance with Article 16, Article 17(1) and Article 18 to each recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. The controller shall inform the data subject about those recipients if the data subject requests it. When a controller is obliged to rectify, erase or restrict personal data in accordance with Articles 16 , 17(1) or 18 GDPR, this only affects the personal data under the control of the controller (i.e. for which the controller determines the purposes and means of the processing - see Article 4(7) GDPR ). The GDPR recognises that any ground for rectification, deletion or restriction could also be relevant for any recipients of the data who might not be aware of the issues that led to the rectification, deletion or restriction by the original controller. [ 1 ] Similarly, the usefulness of the data subjects' rights is limited if the personal data has already been transferred to third parties and those parties are not informed about the data subjects exercising their rights. For example: A retailer collects the incorrect address of the data subject and discloses this information to a postal service provider for the deliverance of a package and to a debt collection agency for the collection of an outstanding debt. If the retailer finally finds out about the incorrectness of the address, it is obvious that also the recipients of the information need to know about the incorrectness. Article 19 GDPR therefore requires controllers to communicate their exercise to any recipients of personal data subject to rectification, deletion or restriction under Articles 16 , 17(1) or 18 GDPR. [ 2 ] However, Article 19 GDPR provides also for an exemption of this duty in case the notification of the recipients proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. Finally, the data subject can request to be informed about the recipients of such notification. The first sentence of Article 19 GDPR requires the controller to communicate any rectification, erasure or restriction of personal data carried out in accordance with Articles 16 , 17(1) or 18 GDPR to all recipients to whom the affected personal data have been disclosed. Similar to the controller's information obligation in Articles 13 and 14 GDPR, the notification obligation under Article 19 GDPR does not need a prior request by the data subject but has to be performed on the controller's own initiative. This is not the case regarding the information of the data subject about those recipients (see Commentary on the information of the data subject bellow). However, it is commonly understood that the notification obligation under Article 19 GDPR is only applicable in case the data subject requested the rectification, erasure or restriction of the data; in particular, the deletion on the controller's own initiative due to an obligation under Article 17(1) GDPR would not fall under Article 19 GDPR. [ 3 ] But such an interpretation is not covered by the wording of the provision and a different handling of this situation makes little sense, e.g. considering the obligation to delete data in case it was unlawfully processed. For example: A credit information agency processes information about an outstanding debt of a data subject. It turns out that the information was incorrect and the debt did not refer to the data subject. In the meantime the credit information agency disclosed the information to some customers (banks, insurance companies, etc). It would be unreasonable to apply the credit information agency's notification obligation under Article 19 GDPR only in case the data subject exercised its right of erasure and not in case the controller deleted the information on its own initiative (e.g. after being informed by its data source). Rather, the controller should notify any recipients in both cases. A recipient of the personal data is any natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not (see Commentary on the definition of recipient in Article 4(9) GDPR ). While the provision clearly covers recipients, the CJEU indicated that there can also be an obligation to inform the source from which the controller received that personal data (even if not directly under Article 19 GDPR). [ 4 ] The disclosure can take place by transmission, dissemination or by otherwise making the data available . [ 5 ] However, if data has been made public, the applicable notification provision is Article 17(2) GDPR , provided that all requirements set therein are met (see below). [ 6 ] Article 19 GDPR does not establish any specific modalities or time requirements for the notification. However, Article 12 GDPR provides for such modalities and is applicable to Article 19 GDPR. These modalities can therefore be applied to the notification obligation as well. [ 7 ] Therefore, the notification should be done immediately and recipients should be notified either \u201c in writing, or by other means, including, where appropriate, by electronic means \u201d ( Article 12(1) GDPR ). [ 8 ] The controller is only obliged to communicate any rectification, deletion or restriction but is not responsible for any action taken by the recipient. Also the recipient itself is not directly obliged by this provision to perform any rectification, deletion or restriction itself. However, they can be obliged under Article 5(1)(d) and 17(1) GDPR to correct or delete the affected personal data when they are aware it is inaccurate or a ground for deletion applies. [ 9 ] In particular, if the recipient processes the affected personal data based on another legal basis under Article 6 GDPR and for another purpose or can use either of the exceptions under Article 17(3) GDPR, the controller might not be under an obligation to rectify or delete the affected personal data. [ 10 ] For example: An employer processes some of the personal data of its employee for insurance purposes and discloses the data to an insurance agency. Shortly after the disclosure to the insurance agency, the controller doesn't need the data anymore for the purposes for which the data was originally collected for. After failing to erase the data on its own, the employee files an erasure request based on Article 17(1)(a) GDPR. The controller notifies the insurance about the erasure of the data. However, the insurance still needs the data for the purposes of providing the insurance and its storage obligations. The obligation to notify under Article 19 GDPR should not be confused with that under Article 17(2) regarding the \"right to be forgotten\". Article 17(2) applies when the number of recipients is indeterminate, whereas in the case of Article 19 GDPR, the number is determinate. Also, Article 17(2) GDPR only applies to cases of requests for erasure, while Article 19 includes cases of rectification and restriction of processing, as provided for in Articles 16 and 18 of the GDPR, respectively. The controller is exempted from the notification obligation if the communication proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort . Exceptions to the notification requirement must be interpreted narrowly. [ 11 ] Thus, they only apply to communication to recipients, but not to any preparatory measures needed to reach out to them such as compiling a list of all recipients of the data subject's data. The controller bears the burden of proof to show exceptions apply. [ 12 ] A communication is only impossible if it is factually impossible to determine the recipients, such as when a recipient is not reachable or no longer exists and has no legal successor. Thus, the use of a data protection management system is recommended insofar as it keeps track of each recipient and enables the rapid implementation of the notification obligation after each correction, deletion and restriction of processing. [ 13 ] Financial or other practical difficulties are irrelevant, and may only be considered when evaluating disproportionate effort. [ 14 ] The assessment of \" disproportionate effort \" must be carried out on a case by case basis. The cost for the controller (in terms of money  and time) and the recipients need to be weighed against the interests of the data subject. To evaluate the interests of the data subject, consideration should be given to the impact of the processing on their rights and freedoms, the likelihood that the recipients will still be processing the data contrary to the exercise of the data subject's rights, and whether the communication is actually in the interest of the data subject. [ 15 ] Reference can be made to the similar assessment (exemption from the information obligation in case of a disproportionate effort) in Article 14(5)(b) GDPR (see commentary on that provision). The second sentence of Article 19 GDPR stipulates that the controller must, if requested by the data subject, inform him or her about tho se recipients . It has been debated whether \u201c those recipients \u201d refers to all recipients to whom the personal data have been disclosed, or only those who are actually notified (excluding, therefore, those for which notification proved impossible, or involved a disproportionate effort). In line with the objectives of the GDPR, the latter reading \" should in principle be excluded, as the data subject has a special interest in knowing precisely which recipients might hold the data but have not been notified, in order to reach out to them by other means, if appropriate \". [ 16 ] This understanding is supported by the purpose of Article 19 GDPR, which is to support the exercise of the rights to rectification, erasure, and restriction. [ 17 ] Indeed, the data subject can only enforce these if they know the actual recipients of their personal data. Moreover, the EDPB seems to support this interpretation in their Guidelines on the Right of Access. [ 18 ] However, the scope of the obligation is subject to some debate. [ 19 ] The information given to the data subject should comply with the general requirements set forth in Article 12 GDPR . [ 20 ] This information obligation, the second sentence of Article 19 GDPR, does not provide for the two exemptions provided for in the notification obligation (first sentence of Article 19 GDPR), namely impossibility or disproportionate effort. Therefore, the controller must be able to provide the information to the data subject if so requested.  In order to comply with this obligation, the controller has to record the recipients of personal data. \u2192 See Article 23 GDPR . \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 19 GDPR . \u2191 Herbst , in K\u00fchling, Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 19 GDPR, margin numbers 1 (C.H.

Decisions 5 References Article 1: Subject-matter and objectives 1. This Regulation lays down rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and rules relating to the free movement of personal data. 2. This Regulation protects fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data. 3. The free movement of personal data within the Union shall be neither restricted nor prohibited for reasons connected with the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. Article 1 GDPR is mainly programmatic and sets out the general objectives of the GDPR. While this is relevant for the understanding and interpretation of the GDPR, Article 1 has limited legal relevance for controllers and data subjects in daily practice. The aims can function as guiding principles to interpreting the GDPR. [ 1 ] Article 1(1) establishes the GDPR's two main aims. First, it aims at protecting natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data, at the same time it recognizes the EU internal market interest in the free movement of such data. Both objectives are already named in the title of the GDPR. The European Union is based on the idea of a common market, that provide for four freedoms, namely the free movement of goods, capital and people, as well as the freedom to establish and provide services. Different national data protection laws - or indeed the lack of such laws - would conflict with these freedoms. If Member States would, for example, prohibit the transfer of personal data to another Member State where there is no equivalent protection, trade between these Member States would be more complicated. For example: If France would protect personal data, but Germany would not, the French protections could only be enforced if personal data would not leave France. Such national limitations would limit the European common market. Consequently the GDPR aims to provide a common level of protection, allowing personal data to flow freely within the European common market. [ 2 ] Article 1(1) also clarifies that the GDPR applies to the processing of personal data concerning natural persons. It follows that the GDPR does not apply to the processing of  data belonging to companies, public bodies or other legal entities. [ 3 ] However, if data about a legal entity contains or relates to a natural person or a natural person engages in a professional activity, such data is still within the scope of the GDPR, as clarified by the CJEU in C-398/15 - Salvatore Manni . [ 4 ] For example: If the 'Peter Smith Limited' company is wholly owned by Peter Smith, who is also the only manager of the company, information as to the revenue about 'Peter Smith Limited' can be directly linked to Peter Smith, making the GDPR applicable to such information. Equally, the email peter.smith@examplecompany.com that is used professionally by Peter Smith can be linked to Peter Smith and therefore relates to a natural person. It does not matter if this person acts in a commercial or private capacity. You can find more details about the scope of the term 'personal data' under Article 4(1) GDPR . Non-EU citizens can rely on the GDPR as its application is generally independent of nationality. [ 5 ] This is also in line with Article 8 CFR (\" Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data \") as the right to data protection is a human right, that generally applies to all humans, not just EU citizens. For example: A Chinese or South African citizen can generally be subject to the GDPR, as the right to data protection is a human right, not a citizen right. While citizenship is not a factor in the GDPR, there are other geographic factors that limit the application of the GDPR. You can find further details about the territorial scope in Article 3 GDPR . According to Article 1(2), the Regulation generally protects the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual as well as 'in particular ' the right to the protection of personal data. Thus, the provisions of the GDPR on the protection of personal data seem to have two objectives. On the one hand, the protection of personal data - which may not come as a surprise. On the other hand, the legislator took the view that the protection of personal data also (indirectly) protects other 'fundamental rights and freedoms'. [ 6 ] In the joined cases C\u2011293/12 and C\u2011594/12 - Digital Rights Ireland - on so-called 'data retention' where communication metadata was stored for up to two year for criminal investigations, the CJEU held that \"it is not inconceivable that the retention of the data in question might have an effect on... their exercise of the freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 11 of the Charter\". CJEU - C\u2011293/12 and C\u2011594/12 - Digital Rights Ireland and Others (Joined Cases) , margin number 28. Article 8(1) CFR provides for 'the right to the protection of personal data' of a natural person. Some requirements to the processing of data follow from Article 8(2) CFR, which explicitly mentions the principles of fairness and purpose limitation, as well as lawfulness. Another essential fundamental right that is clearly protected by the GDPR is the right to privacy in Article 7 CFR. This concerns the right to respect for 'private and family life' and 'communications' and is distinct from, and often broader than, the right to data protection in Article 8 CFR. However, the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 of the CFR do not appear to be the only interests protected by the GDPR. Indeed, processing operations are able to impact other fundamental rights such as personality rights, freedom of expression, freedom of information, freedom of communication, the right of assembly, freedom of religion and other anti-discrimination rights. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] The fundamental rights to privacy, personality and data protection are the backbone of a free society. There can be no freedom where the individual is not in control of their data, feels observed, tracked or continuously assessed. [ 9 ] Indeed, Recital 4 clearly states that \u201c the processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind \u201d, not the opposite. For example: A person may be only really free to vote, if the secrecy of the ballot is ensured. If a person is afraid that her political beliefs may become known to her employer, spouse or friends, she may not actually vote according to her true convictions. The right to data protection can therefore be seen as an enabler for other fundamental rights. The protection of personal data often forms a precondition for the exercise of other fundamental rights. Obviously the right to data protection can conflict with a range of other interests, such as the right to freedom of speech, commercial interests, public interests or security and safety interests. Recital 4 accepts that the right to data protection has to be balanced against these other interests and fundamental rights, but also highlights that these other rights and interests were already taken into consideration when the GDPR was drafted. There is consequently no need to 'balance' the GDPR against other rights for a second time, as the GDPR is already the result of a political balancing of Article 8 CFR and other rights and interests. Common mistake: Some lawyers argue that the GDPR would have to be 'balanced' with the right to conduct a business under Article 16 CFR. However, Article 16 CFR has a limited scope and e.g. ensures that everyone can open a business and can decide over business partners. There is also only a freedom to conduct a business 'in accordance with community law' - not in violation of community law (such as the GDPR). While there is no general balancing test, the GDPR foresees specific flexible provisions, like the recognition of legitimate interests in Article 6(1)(f) GDPR which allows to balance conflicting rights e.g. in the case of fraud prevention or the need to enforce legal claims. There are also a number of opening clauses, like Article 85 on freedom of speech or Article 86 on freedom of information. In many cases Member States have the option to come up with legal requirements to process personal data in the public interest or restrict the GDPR insofar as these national laws are necessary and proportionate. [ 10 ] The fact that the GDPR implements the protection of fundamental rights in secondary legislation, also requires that the GDPR is interpreted in the light of these fundamental rights. In C-311/18 - Schrems II on data transfers from the EU to the US, where secret services can access such personal data, the CJEU has highlighted that the GDPR must be interpreted in light of the CFR. This is not only limited to the right to data protection in Article 8 CFR and the closely related right to privacy in Article 7 CFR, but for example also includes the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial under Article 47 CFR. [ 11 ] \"[T]he interpretation of EU law and examination of the legality of EU legislation must be undertaken in the light of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter [\u2026]\". CJEU - C-311/18 - Schrems II , margin number 99.. This means that any interpretation of the GDPR that would disproportionally limit the right to data protection under Article 8 CFR could not be sustained. This also allows the application of the proportionality test under Article 52(1) CFR, which often leads to a clear answer when interpreting the GDPR. [ 12 ] In its case law, the CJEU has also repeatedly stressed [ 13 ] that the GDPR (and the previous Directive 95/46/EC ) is aiming for a \" high level of protection \". [ 14 ] This term was regularly used to convey a more protective interpretation of the GDPR by the CJEU, and is taken from Recitals 6 and 10 of the GDPR. Although conflicting views exist, [ 15 ] the approach that gives the right to data protection prevalence over other legally relevant interests is preferred by the CJEU, [ 16 ] in order to uphold the this high level of protection foreseen by the GDPR. Existing CJEU case law contains useful examples of the current state of play. In the joined cases C\u2011293/12 and C\u2011594/12 - Digital Rights Ireland the CJEU has, for example, held that the prevention of terrorism does not allow the retention of meta data from phone records. [ 17 ] Similarly, in other cases, public interest in financial transparency in the public sector was not seen to override the interest of employees [ 18 ] or recipients of subsidies. [ 19 ] While these judgments were mainly concerning public sector violations of Article 7 and 8 CFR, they seem to also apply to private actors, given that the GDPR must be interpreted in light of the CFR. For example: If in the joined cases C\u2011293/12 and C\u2011594/12 - Digital Rights Ireland the CJEU prohibited governments to keep phone records to fight terrorism and serious crime, it seems hard to argue that private entities could claim a legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR for communication data for purposes that are even less serious. Such a legitimate interest would have to cross the red lines set in the CJEU case law, given that the GDPR must be interpreted in the light of Article 8 CFR. Under Article 1(3) GDPR , the free movement of personal data within the Union shall be neither restricted nor prohibited for reasons related to personal data protection. The provision is mainly aimed at Member States, which may have an interest to pass so-called data localization laws. The free movement of personal data is limited to the Union, meaning the European Economic Area (EEA). The EEA includes all EU Member States, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The status of various special territories of EU Member States require additional checks, as some form part of the EEA, while others do not. The UK is not a Member State anymore. Non-EU/EEA countries do not benefit from the free flow of personal data. In fact, the CJEU has set rather high standards for international data transfers. [ 20 ] The free flow of personal data is explicitly limited to the EEA. Rules on transfers to non-EU/EEA countries ('third countries') can be found in Chapter V of the GDPR. For example: When a Czech controller is storing personal data with a Norwegian cloud provider, the companies do not have to worry about international data flows, because the GDPR prohibits limitations on such data flows. However, when a Spanish controller is using a Swiss provider, there needs to be an additional legal basis for these data flows. There is an ongoing discussion on whether the free flow of personal data only protects data flowing between systems that are on EEA territory, or if systems on non-EEA territory - that are under the effective control of an EEA controller or processor - would still benefit from the free flow of personal data, given that the GDPR would still apply to them. The European Commission has recently taken an entity-based approach (focusing on the question of whether the controlling entity falls under the territorial scope in Article 3 GDPR ), not a data-based approach (focusing on the question of whether the data is physically staying in the EEA). [ 21 ] The wording of the GDPR does not seem to support an entity-based approach. [ 22 ] At the same time, however, the definition of the GDPR's territorial scope of application is explicitly uncoupled from the question of whether the processing 'takes place in the Union or not' (cf. Art. 3(1)). \u2191 Hornung and Spiecker in Simitis, Hornung, Spiecker gen.

The data subject shall have the right to receive the personal data concerning him or her, which he or she has provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data have been provided, where: 2.   In exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to paragraph 1, the data subject shall have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible. 3.   The exercise of the right referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be without prejudice to Article 17. That right shall not apply to processing necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. 4.   The right referred to in paragraph 1 shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. Article 20 GDPR provides for the right to data portability . This right empowers data subjects to receive a copy of their personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. However, this right is subject to various conditions; i.e. the right is only applicable if the underlying processing is based on either the data subject's consent ( Article 6(1)(a) GDPR ) or on a contract ( Article 6(1)(b) GDPR ). After receiving their personal data, the data subject can decide what they want to do with this data. Article 20 GDPR clarifies that the data subject is, in particular, free to transfer the data to another controller without hindrance from the original controller. The recipients of this data are not limited to providers that offer similar or comparable services, as the right to portability can be exercised with any controller data subjects choose, within the conditions specified below. The purpose of the right to data portability is to give data subjects more control over their personal data by granting them some authority over usage of the data. The provision's objective is to increase competition by facilitating movement of data between providers and enabling data subject's to switch between service providers. [ 1 ] It should be recalled that Article 12 GDPR provides for formalities (e.g. rules on deadlines) applicable to all data subjects rights \u2013 including the right to data portability in Article 20 GDPR. Article 20(1) GDPR outlines the right to data portability itself and its requirements. Article 20(2) GDPR stipulates that the data subject can also request a direct transmission of personal data from one controller to another if this is technically feasible. Article 20(3) GDPR provides for a clarification of the relationship with Article 17 GDPR and states that the right to data portability is not applicable in case the underlying processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. Article 20(4) GDPR clarifies that the right to data portability must not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. WP29 Guidelines: for this Article see WP29 , Guidelines on the right to data portability under Regulation 2016/679, WP242 rev.01, 5. April 2017 (available here ). Article 20(1) GDPR provides for the data subject's right to request and obtain a copy of any personal data they have provided to the controller and which is being processed based on the data subject's consent ( Article 6(1)(a) or 9(2) GDPR ) or contract ( Article 6(1)(b) GDPR ). This information must be structured in an accessible and intelligible manner, so that both the data subject themselves and any controllers who may receive it in the future can understand and make use of it. Article 20(1) GDPR gives the data subject the right to request from a controller to receive the personal data concerning them if the conditions set out in Article 20(1) GDPR are met. \"Data portability is a right of the data subject to receive a subset of the personal data processed by a data controller concerning him or her, and to  store those data for further personal use. Such storage can be on a private device or on a private cloud, without necessarily transmitting the data to another data controller.\" WP29, Guidelines on the right to data portability under Regulation 2016/679, WP242 rev.01, 5. April 2017, p. 4. In this regard, the right to data portability is quite similar to the data subject's right to get access to a copy of their personal data undergoing processing in accordance with Article 15(3) GDPR . For example: A controller provides a service to the data subject encompassing the processing of notes provided by the data subject. The processing activity is based on the necessity to perfom the contract with the data subject. If the data wants to receive the notes it provided to the controller, it can request access under Article 15(1) and (3) GDPR as well request to receive the data due to their right to data portability under Article 20 GDPR or both. However, it is important to keep these two rights distinct. In particular, due to the different requirements for the exercise of those rights. [ 2 ] A data portability request only applies to personal data concerning the data subject. Pseudonymous data is therefore also within the scope of this provision. [ 3 ] Any data that is anonymous or not concerning the data subject are not subject to the right to data portability. [ 4 ] \"As an example, telephone, interpersonal messaging or VoIP records may include (in the subscriber\u2019s account history) details of third parties involved in incoming and outgoing calls. Although records will therefore contain personal data concerning multiple people, subscribers should be able to have these records provided to them in response to data portability requests, because the records are (also) concerning the data subject. However, where such records are then transmitted to a new data controller, this new data controller should not process them for any purpose which would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of the third-parties [...].\" WP29, Guidelines on the right to data portability under Regulation 2016/679, WP242 rev.01, 5. April 2017, p. 9. It should be noted that personal data concerning the data subject, as well as another natural person, is in principle subject to this provision. [ 5 ] However, the exemption in Article 20(4) GDPR could apply if the right to data portability would adversely affect the other persons rights and freedoms (see Commentary on Article 20(4) below). Article 20 GDPR specifies that only personal data provided by the data subject is covered by the right to data portability. This includes data that the user knowingly and actively provides, such as their name and mailing address, as well as, data that is observed from the user's activity, such as their search history or location data. [ 6 ] In other words, the scope of this provision covers data provided by the data subject, meaning the data that was actively given to the controller (e.g. photos uploaded to the service) as well as data which was provided in the sense of knowingly generated by the data subject's activity (e.g. activity logs, food preferences); this definition also includes data that has been transferred to the controller in the context of the exercise of the right to data portability. [ 7 ] However, it should be noted that there is a doctrinal debate regarding whether or not \"observed data\" should be included within the scope of application of portability. [ 8 ] Personal data generated by the controller, e.g. by combining and analysing existing information, does not constitute as data provided by the data subject. [ 9 ] \"Inferred data and derived data are created by the data controller on the basis of the data \u201cprovided by the data subject\u201d. For example, the outcome of an assessment regarding the health of a user or the profile created in the context of risk management and financial regulations (e.g. to assign a credit score or comply with anti-money laundering rules) cannot in themselves be considered as \u201cprovided by\u201d the data subject. Even though such data may be part of a profile kept by a data controller and are inferred or derived from the analysis of data provided by the data subject (through his actions for example), these data will typically not be considered as \u201cprovided by the data subject\u201d and thus will not be within scope of this new right.\" WP29, Guidelines on the right to data portability under Regulation 2016/679, WP242 rev.01, 5. April 2017, p. 10. According to Recital 68, the data should be available in an \" interoperable format \", which data controllers \" should be encouraged to develop \". In turn, \" interoperable \" refers to the ability of disparate and diverse organisations to \" interact towards mutually beneficial and agreed common goals, involving the sharing of information and knowledge between the organisations, through the business processes they support, by means of the exchange of data between their respective ICT systems .\" [ 10 ] According to Article 20(1) GDPR the data should be provided to the data subject in a \" structured, commonly used and machine-readable format \". Beyond this requirement, the GDPR does not call for a specific format to be used. The terms \u201c structured \u201d, \u201c commonly used \u201d and \u201c machine-readable \u201d are a set of minimal requirements that should facilitate the \" interoperability \" of the data format provided by the data controller. [ 11 ] Formats subject to costly licensing constraints are not considered \" commonly used \". The personal data provided should have a high level of abstraction from any internal or proprietary format, and metadata should be used to describe the exchanged information accurately. [ 12 ] Industry stakeholders and trade associations are encouraged to work together on a common set of interoperable standards and formats to deliver the requirements of the right to data portability. The Commission has published a Communication on \" ICT Standardisation Priorities for the Digital Single Market \", which may be used as a basis for the development of standards for the purposes of data portability. [ 13 ] The right to data portability, as outlined in Article 20(1) GDPR, also enables data subjects to transmit their personal data from one data controller to another without hindrance. [ 14 ] This goes beyond the ability to simply obtain and reuse personal data and allows individuals to transfer their data to another service provider, regardless of whether it is within the same sector or not. By preventing lock-in situations , data portability empowers consumers and is expected to foster innovation and secure sharing of personal data between controllers under the control of the data subject. Additionally, it can enhance customer experiences by facilitating the controlled and limited sharing of personal data between organisations. This feature of data portability has the potential to facilitate the transfer and reuse of personal data among various services of interest to the user. [ 15 ] However, Article 20 GDPR provides for no obligation of the receiving controller to accept the transmission of data from the original controller. [ 16 ] Article 20(1) stipulates that individuals have the right to transfer their data to another controller without facing any obstructions (i.e. hindrance) from the initial controller who is obliged to provide the personal data to the data subject (and in some cases directly to the other controller\u2013see Commentary on Article 20(2) GDPR below). \"Such hindrance can be characterised as any legal, technical or financial obstacles placed by data controller in order to refrain or slow down access, transmission or reuse by the data subject or by another data controller. For example, such hindrance could be: fees asked for delivering data, lack of interoperability or access to a data format or API or the provided format, excessive delay or complexity to retrieve the full dataset, deliberate obfuscation of the dataset, or specific and undue or excessive sectorial standardization or accreditation demands.\" WP29, Guidelines on the right to data portability under Regulation 2016/679, WP242 rev.01, 5. April 2017, p. 15 footnotes omitted. It is recommended to offer several options to the data subject in order to exercise their right to data portability. For instance, that data subjects could be offered an opportunity to directly download the data as well as to transmit it directly to another controller; this could be implemented by making an Application Programming Interface ('API') available. [ 17 ] Simultaneously, the data controller should implement measures to facilitate the exercise of the right to data portability. In particular, the controller should provide for the option to exercise the right to data portability to a subset of data which the data subject actually wants to receive and/or transfer to another controller. One way to achieve this is by instituting protocols to verify that only the specific personal data that the data subject wants to transmit is actually being transmitted. This verification process could involve obtaining confirmation from the data subject either prior to transmission, or at an earlier stage such as when they provide initial consent for processing or finalise the contract. [ 18 ] The right to data portability only applies if: the individual has either consented to the processing ( Article 6(1)(a) or 9(2)(a) GDPR) or the information is processed for the execution of a contract between the data subject and controller ( Article 6(1)(b) GDPR) , and the personal data is processed by automated means. The right to data portability, as per Article 20(1)(a) GDPR, is only applicable when the processing of personal data by the controller is based on the data subject's consent in accordance with Article 6(1)(a) GDPR , consent to the processing of special categories of personal data in accordance with Article 9(2)(a) GDPR , or a contract in accordance with Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to which the data subject is a party. Recital 68 specifically highlights that the right to data portability should not be applicable if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than the data subject's consent or a contract. [ 19 ] Consequently, data processed by the controller based on other legal bases (e.g. legitimate interests in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) GDPR ) is not covered by the right to data portability under Article 20 GDPR. For processing based on Article 6(1)(e) GDPR in particular, see commentary on Article 20(3) GDPR below. In case the processing of personal data is based on more than one legal bases, it is sufficient, that one of the applicable legal bases is the data subjects consent or the performance of a contract. In other words, the (additional) invocation of legal bases does not exclude the right to data portability. [ 20 ] In accordance with Article 20(1)(b) GDPR, the right to data portability only applies to processing that is conducted through automated means . Therefore, this condition is not met for non-automated processing of personal data, such as data stored on structured index cards or in non-structured physical files. This limitation clarifies that a controller does not have to convert non-machine-readable records into machine-readable data just in order to fulfill the right to data portability. [ 21 ] This requirement will generally be met in case of internet service providers, who are particularly in the scope of this provision since its target is inter alia to facilitate switching service providers and fostering the development of new services. [ 22 ] While Article 20 GDPR provides little information on modalities of the exercise of the right to data portability, such as deadlines, it should be recalled, that Article 12 GDPR provides for such rules for the exercise of data subjects rights. Therefore, the right to data portability is subject to the modalities set out in Article 12 GDPR. For example, the controller must facilitate the data subject's request, including the authentication of the data subject ( Article 12(2) GDPR ). Obstructive practices in this area not only unduly limit the data subject's rights, but also harm the single market and the free movement of personal data, creating real anti-competitive phenomena or \"lock-in\" effects. [ 23 ] Article 12(3) GDPR requires that the data controller provides \u201c information on action taken \u201d to the data subject \u201c without undue delay \u201d and in any event \u201c within one month of receipt of the request \u201d. As usual, the one month period can be extended to a maximum of three months for complex cases, provided that the data subject has been informed about the reasons for such delay within one month of the original request (see Commentary on Article 12 GDPR ). \"Data controllers who refuse to answer a portability request shall, pursuant to Article 12(4), inform the data subject of \u201cthe reasons for not taking action and on the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and seeking a judicial remedy\u201d, no later than one month after receiving the request\". WP29, Guidelines on the right to data portability under Regulation 2016/679, WP242 rev.01, 5. April 2017, p. 14-15. To meet user expectations, it is a good practice to define the time-frame in which a data portability request can typically be answered and communicate this to data subjects. [ 24 ] Data controllers should consider two distinct but complementary options for providing portable data to data subjects or other controllers. The first option is a direct transmission of the complete dataset or specific parts of it. The second option is an automated tool that allows for the extraction of relevant data. For complex and large datasets, the second option may be preferred as it minimizes risks and allows for the use of data synchronization mechanisms. Making portable data available through various secure means such as messaging, SFTP servers, or secured WebAPI/WebPortal would enable data subjects to use personal data stores or other trusted third parties to hold and manage their personal data. This would also reduce privacy risks for the initial data controller and promote compliance for the new data controller. [ 25 ] Article 20(2) GDPR introduces the right for data subjects to request that their personal data be transmitted directly from the first controller to a second one. Therefore, this right goes beyond the right to simply receive the data from the controller and requires the first controller to submit the data directly to another controller. The right to directly have their data transmitted from one controller to another, spares the data subject the burden of receiving the data and then sending it on to another controller.  In particular, this provision is supposed to enable data subjects to change or use service providers\u2013either within the same business sector as the original controller or in a different one. [ 26 ] The request can be fulfilled through automated transmission, such as an application programming interface (API) that allows for data transfers to other systems implementing the same API. Therefore, it suffices if the data subject is given the opportunity to initiate the transfer by selecting a field labeled e.g. \" Transfer of data to another provider \" choosing a provider, selecting the data to be transferred, and clicking on a corresponding field to initiate the automated transfer. [ 27 ] \"[R]ecital 68 encourages data controllers to develop interoperable formats that enable data portability but without creating an obligation for controllers to adopt or maintain processing systems which are technically compatible. The GDPR does, however, prohibit controllers from establishing barriers to the transmission.\" WP29, Guidelines on the right to data portability under Regulation 2016/679, WP242 rev.01, 5. April 2017, p. 5. It should be noted that the receiving controllers can decide whether to accept and process data from a portability request. [ 28 ] \"A 'receiving' organization becomes a new data controller regarding these personal data and must respect the principles stated in Article 5 of the GDPR. Therefore, the \u201dnew\u201d receiving data controller must clearly and directly state the purpose of the new processing before any request for transmission of the portable data in accordance with the transparency requirements set out in Article 14. As for any other data processing performed under its responsibility, the data controller should apply the principles laid down in Article 5, such as lawfulness, fairness and transparency, purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, integrity and confidentiality, storage limitation and accountability.\" WP29, Guidelines on the right to data portability under Regulation 2016/679, WP242 rev.01, 5. April 2017, p. 7. Article 20(2) GDPR stipulates that the original controller is only obliged to transmit the personal data subject to a data portability request directly to another controller, where this is technically feasible. It should be noted that this feasibility safeguard clause only applies to the direct transmission from one controller to another under Article 20(2) GDPR. Therefore, it does not apply to the scenario outlined in Article 20(1) GDPR where the data subject directly requests to receive the data. Such requests shall always be fulfilled (if the respective requirements are fulfilled), regardless of technical reasons. Recital 68 states that the controller is not required to adopt or maintain technically compatible data processing systems. Therefore, the technical feasibility of direct data transfer is primarily dependent on the existing technical capabilities of the controller. However, according to Article 12(2) GDPR , the controller must facilitate the exercise of data subject rights, including the right to data portability. As such, the data subject may request reasonable cooperation from the controller, such as adapting data transmission formats, to carry out the intended portability. [ 29 ] \"Data controllers are expected to transmit personal data in an interoperable format, although this does not place obligations on other data controllers to support these formats. Direct transmission from one data controller to another could therefore occur when communication between two systems is possible, in a secured way, and when the receiving system is technically in a position to receive the incoming data. If technical impediments prohibit direct transmission, the data controller shall explain those impediments to the data subjects, as his decision will otherwise be similar in its effect to a refusal to take action on a data subject\u2019s request (Article 12(4)).\" WP29, \u2018Guidelines on the right to data portability\u2019, 16/EN WP 242 rev.01, 5 April 2017, p. 16 In case the direct transmission to another controller is deemed not feasible by the initial controller, the controller has to explain the data subjects why this is the case. [ 30 ] The first sentence of Article 20(3) GDPR clarifies that the exercise of the right to data portability is without prejudice to Article 17 GDPR . In particular, this means that the exercise of the right to data portability, and transmission of the data from one controller to another controller, does not automatically trigger the obligation of the first controller to delete the transmitted data. [ 31 ] Rather, the ground for deletion are regulated in Article 17 GDPR . [ 32 ] However, if one of the grounds for deletion in Article 17 GDPR applies, the data subject can request the deletion of the affected data and the controller cannot deny such request due to a potential obligation to fulfill a data portability request. [ 33 ] \"When an individual exercises his or her right to data portability he or she does so without prejudice to any other right (as is the case with any other rights in the GDPR). A data subject can continue to use and benefit from the data controller\u2019s service even after a data portability operation. Data portability does not automatically trigger the erasure of the data from the systems of the data controller, and does not affect the original retention period applying to the data which have been transmitted\" WP29, Guidelines on the right to data portability under Regulation 2016/679, WP242 rev.01, 5. April 2017, p. 7 footnotes omitted. The second sentence excludes that the right to data portability apply if the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. This exception corresponds to processing activities based on the legal basis of Article 6(1)(e) GDPR . In such cases, the controller invoking this legal basis for the processing is not required to comply with a request for data portability. [ 34 ] This provision seems rather redundant since Article 20(1) GDPR requires that the processing is based on the data subject's consent ( Article 6(1)(a) GDPR ) or on a contract ( Article 6(1)(b) GDPR ) in order for the right to data portability to apply. [ 35 ] In accordance with Article 20(4) GDPR, the right to data portability must not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. Others could be another natural person or a legal entity. While this provision refers to the right to data portability in Article 20(1) GDPR, it should also be applied to direct transmissions under Article 20(2) GDPR. [ 36 ] Rights and freedoms of others can generally be adversely effected in two ways. First, the personal data could also concern other data subjects besides the data subject exercising their right to data portability. Such an adverse effect for the other data subject could occur if the recipient of the data uses the information for other incompatible purposes. [ 37 ] However, the fact that the personal data concerns other data subjects as well does not always mean that the right to data portability would lead to an adverse effect for the other data subject. In particular, providing the information to the data subject making the request can hardly have an adverse effect on other data subjects since the data subject itself provided the information to a controller in the first place. Therefore, an adverse effect will generally only be possible in case the other data subject's personal data is transferred to another controller. [ 38 ] \"For example, a webmail service may allow the creation of a directory of a data subject\u2019s contacts, friends, relatives, family and broader environment. Since these data relate to (and are created by) the identifiable individual that wishes to exercise his right to data portability, data controllers should transmit the entire directory of incoming and outgoing e-mails to that data subject. Similarly, a data subject\u2019s bank account can contain personal data relating to the transactions not just of the account holder but also those of other individuals (e.g., if they have transferred money to the account holder). The rights and freedoms of those third parties are unlikely to be adversely affected by the transmission of the bank account information to the account holder once a portability request is made\u2014provided that in both examples the data are used for the same purpose (i.e., a contact address only used by the data subject or a history of the data subject\u2019s bank account.\" WP29, Guidelines on the right to data portability under Regulation 2016/679, WP242 rev.01, 5. April 2017, p. 11. It should be noted that a (new) controller receiving the information from the data subject (or directly from the original controller) also has to comply with the GDPR; in particular the receiving controller needs a valid legal basis for the processing of the personal data. [ 39 ] Second, the affected data could cover intellectual property or trade secrets. [ 40 ] Since the data was provided to the controller by the data subject, is can be considered rather unlikely that the data itself constitute a trade secret. But it might be the case that the particular structure of the information constitute a trade secret. [ 41 ] Controllers cannot refuse to transfer data based solely on the possibility of such legally protected interests being infringed; instead, they must seek ways to transfer the data in a manner that avoids the disclosure of legally protected secrets. [ 42 ] \"A potential business risk cannot, however, in and of itself serve as the basis for a refusal to answer the portability request and data controllers can transmit the personal data provided by data subjects in a form that does not release information covered by trade secrets or intellectual property rights.\" WP29, Guidelines on the right to data portability under Regulation 2016/679, WP242 rev.01, 5. April 2017, p. 12. Due to the similar wording and purpose of the provisions, see also Commentary on Article 15(4) GDPR . It should be recalled that Article 12(5) GDPR provides for circumstances in which a controller can refuse to act on a request (i.e. in case a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive). Article 23 GDPR provides for the option to impose restrictions on the right to data portability under Article 20 GDPR (see commentary on Articles 12 - 15 GDPR). It is important to refer to the interplay of the right to data portability with the proposed or adopted legislation under the umbrella of the EU digital strategy [ 43 ] . The Digital Markets Act (DMA) [ 44 ] imposes a new obligation on \"gatekeepers\" that enhances the right to data portability. According to Article 6(9) DMA, gatekeepers shall  provide end users and third parties authorised by an end user with effective portability of data provided by the end user or generated through their activity on the gatekeeper\u2019s core platform services, including by the provision of continuous and real-time access to such data. Recital 59 DMA clarifies that this obligation on the gatekeeper complements the right to data portability under the GDPR. Further, the Data Act [ 45 ] is supposed to help users of connected devices to unlock access to data generated by them and reinforces the right to data portability by creating an obligation on \"data holders\" to make available the data generated by such devices (Article 5 Data Act). This obligation is supposed to empower a user (e.g. a data subject) to request the porting of personal and non-personal data from their Internet of Things devices (IoT) to a third party \" without undue delay, of the same quality as is available to the data holder, easily, securely, free of charge to the user, in a comprehensive, structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and, where relevant and technically feasible, continuously and in real-time \". The scope of the data to be transmitted is not limited by the legal basis under which the data is processed by the data holder (e.g. controller) and therefore has the potential to unlock the portability of more data. Article 5 Data Act applies from 12 September 2025. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 20 GDPR \u2191 Herbst , in K\u00fchling, Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 20 GDPR, margin numbers 1 (C.H.

At the latest at the time of the first communication with the data subject, the right referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be explicitly brought to the attention of the data subject and shall be presented clearly and separately from any other information. 5.   In the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, the data subject may exercise his or her right to object by automated means using technical specifications. 6.   Where personal data are processed for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1), the data subject, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, shall have the right to object to processing of personal data concerning him or her, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest. Article 21 GDPR establishes the data subject's right to object to the processing of their personal data. This instrument enables data subject's to challenge a (generally lawful) processing activity due to their particular situation with the consequence that the controller has to stop the processing unless it can demonstrate that it has an overriding legitimate ground for the processing. The GDPR does not grant data subjects a general right to object to the processing of their personal data. Rather, this right is limited to the circumstances outlined in Article 21(1) to (6) GDPR. [ 1 ] However, in case of processing for direct marketing purposes, the data subject can always object to the processing and the controller cannot claim any overriding interest. [ 2 ] As any other right of the data subject, this provision has to be read in conjunction with Article 12 GDPR which provides formalities about the exercise of\u2013and compliance with\u2013data subject rights. [ 3 ] Article 21(1) GDPR provides for the right to object the processing of personal data that may be lawful based on a permissible balancing of interests under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (i.e. processing based on a legitimate interest of the controller of a third party) or Article 6(1)(e) GDPR (i.e. processing carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller). Article 21(2) and (3) GDPR establish a specific and unconditional right to object in the case of data processing for direct marketing purposes. Article 21(4) GDPR obliges the controller to inform data subjects about the existence of the right to object at the time of the first communication with the data subject. Article 21(5) GDPR enables the exercise of the right to object through automated procedures using technical specifications in the context of information society services. Lastly, Article 21(6) GDPR grants an additional specific right to object to data processing for research or statistical purposes. Article 21(1) GDPR grants data subjects the right to object, on grounds relating to their particular situation, to processing based on a legitimate interest ( Article 6(1)(f) GDPR ), or that is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority ( Article 6(1)(e) GDPR ). After a successful objection, the controller stops the affected processing of the data subject's personal data. Controllers may reject this objection if they demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing activity which overrides the data subject\u2019s interests, rights, and freedoms, or for the establishment, exercise, or defence of claims. Once an objection has been submitted in accordance with Article 21(1) GDPR and is accompanied by an appropriate justification by the data subject (i.e. grounds relating to the data subject's particular situation), the data controller is obligated to cease processing the data. [ 4 ] The right to object requires a request from the data subject. There are no specific provisions, therefore the general rules of Article 12 GDPR apply, adapted to the specific cases, where appropriate. The controller must communicate in a clear, understandable, and easily accessible manner the actions taken in response to the request (Article 12(1) GDPR ), and facilitate the entire process ( Article 12(2) GDPR ). The response must be provided promptly, within one month of the request, and no later than three months if the time extension under Article 12(3) GDPR applies. It should be recalled, that under Article 18(1)(d) GDPR , the data subject can request the restriction of their personal data if they objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) GDPR during the time it takes the controller to verify whether legitimate grounds override the data subject's interests, rights and freedoms. The request does not require any specific form and can be submitted in written, oral, or electronic form. A general request, even not framed in legal terms, is sufficient. [ 5 ] In particular, there is no need to assign a specific \"title\" to the request; it can be implied, for example, when the contractual relationship between the parties is terminated. [ 6 ] However, the request must at least contain the reasons for the data subject's objection and the prevailing interest believed to be violated. This is a necessary requirement; otherwise, the controller would not be able to perform the underlying interest balancing, except in the case of an Objection against direct marketing under Article 21(2) and (3) GDPR, where such balancing is not required. However, this requirement should not be interpreted too restrictively for the data subject, considering the obligation to facilitate the request under Article 12(2) GDPR . In this regard, if the data subject's request is not clear, the controller may seek clarification and strive for a swift resolution of the dispute. The data subject can object to the processing of their data at any time. Accordingly, an objection can be made during the processing and even before the processing activity starts in order to avoid the commencement of the processing activity. [ 7 ] This phrase provides for a threshold for the exercise of the right to object under Article 21(1) GDPR. Data subjects will not be able to exercise their right to object to the processing of their personal data under Article 21(1) GDPR, unless they assert specific reasons which pertain to their individual situation. [ 8 ] These reasons can, for example, be of a legal, economic, ethical, social, societal, or family nature. [ 9 ] The data subject's objection must be justified by something atypical to their situation, which can be assumed to have previously been unknown to the controller, and which it could therefore not take into account in its overall assessment under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR . For example, it would not be sufficient for a data subject to merely indicate that they do not want the processing to occur. [ 10 ] However, this threshold should not be interpreted too strictly and it is not necessary that the grounds for the objection are so severe that it poses a risk to the data subject's life or property. [ 11 ] The burden of proof for the grounds in the data subject's particular situation lies with the data subject. [ 12 ] But as the EDPB states, a controller should not dismiss an objection by a data subject just because they did not elaborate much on their particular situation in their objection under Article 21(1) GDPR. Rather, the controller should ask the data subject to further specify their request. [ 13 ] The wording of Article 21(1) GDPR does not explicitly define the scope of an objection. However, the wording does not exclude the possibility that the data subject may object to specific forms of processing (e.g. transmission) or to the processing of certain data, rather than objecting to the entire processing. The mention of profiling in Article 21(1) GDPR also supports this possibility, as profiling is a distinct form of processing that can coexist with other forms of processing. If the data subject objects solely to profiling, other forms of processing can still be carried out. Therefore, the data subject has the option to object to the entire processing or only to specific parts of it. [ 14 ] The right to object is limited to cases where personal data processing is based on Article 6(1)(e) GDPR (i.e. \" processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller \") or Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (i.e. \" processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject \"). Consequently, the right to object applies to cases where the controller has initially considered the prevalence of their defended interest, specifically, the public interest in the case of Article 6(1)(e) and the controller's legitimate interest in the case of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR . In other words, there is a balancing of interests carried out by the controller at the core of the processing. [ 15 ] For example: A processes the address of numerous data subjects for the purpose of verifying addresses for fraud prevention purposes. Assuming this activity can generally be based on a legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, a data subject could object to such processing since they were a victim of a stalker and was forced to relocate. Therefore, they have a particular interest in keeping their address information secret. This also explains why the right to object does not apply to other legal bases. For example, consent can be revoked at any time. Revocation does not need to be \"explained\" and does not require an assessment by the controller. In the case of processing based on a contract, objecting would be inconsistent as it goes against the contractual interest of the data subject. For instance, if a data subject purchases a product and then objects to the use of their address for delivery, it would be a case of venire contra factum proprium . Lastly, in the case of processing based on a legal obligation, it is assumed that the legislator has already conducted the balancing of interests and has mandated the legitimacy of the processing by law. In this case, the legislative decision takes precedence over the data subject's subjective right. [ 16 ] Article 21(1) GDPR specifies that data subjects can object to processing based on Article 6(1)(e) and (f) GDPR , \u201c including profiling based on those provisions .\u201d Profiling is defined in Article 4(4) GDPR as a form of automated processing consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person. Because all types of processing based on Article 6(1)(e) or (f) GDPR are clearly covered by Article 21(1) GDPR, mentioning profiling specifically is somewhat legally redundant. [ 17 ] However, it can be seen to serve as more of a reminder, to the effect that the right of objection can apply especially with regard to profiling, which can be a problematic form of processing in the sense that sweeping and potentially incorrect conclusions are drawn about data subjects. [ 18 ] Once an objection in accordance with Article 21(1) GDPR has been raised with proper justification, the data controller is obligated to cease the processing activities unless it can demonstrate valid grounds for continuing the activities. This does not occur automatically upon the objection, but rather after a prompt assessment by the data controller, determining that the factual requirements are met and there are no grounds for exemptions (see below). The assessment must be conducted without delay and its outcome promptly shared with the data subject. This notification is crucial. In theory, if the objection is successful, the data controller is not only required to cease processing but generally also has to delete the personal data used, in accordance with Article 17(1)(c) GDPR . However, the data subject may have an interest in not having the data deleted and instead preferring its restriction, as provided for in Article 18(1)(b) GDPR . Without such notification, this possibility of restriction would be practically impossible. In any case, the processing conducted prior to a valid objection remains unaffected (with an ex-nunc effect). [ 19 ] Again, it should be recalled, that the data subject can request the restriction of the processing under Article 18(1)(d) GDPR for the time it takes the controller to verify whether it has an overriding ground for processing (see Commentary on Article 18(1)(d) GDPR for more information). In the event of an objection from the data subject, the controller is required to cease processing (as mentioned above) and potentially delete the involved data. The GDPR includes two fundamental exceptions to this principle, allowing for the continuation of processing even when a valid objection is raised. The first exception applies when the controller demonstrates [ 20 ] that the objected processing is, or continues to be, justified by \" compelling legitimate grounds \" that outweigh the interests of the data subject. The second exception applies when the processing is necessary for \" the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. \" The burden of proof for this demonstration is on the controller and the presumption is in favor of the data subject objecting to a processing activity. [ 21 ] This provision presents controversial elements that have sparked debates and varying interpretations. The prevailing interpretation tends to argue that the burden of proving \" compelling legitimate grounds \" applies only to \" processing which overrides the interests, rights, and freedoms of the data subject. \" Consequently, it is not necessary to demonstrate \" compelling legitimate grounds \" for \" the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. \" [ 22 ] An intermediate interpretation suggests that in the second scenario (legal claims), the \" compelling legitimate grounds \" are presumed because the law itself considers the ability to bring legal action to be \" compelling \". In support of this interpretation, reference is made to the content of Recital 69, which only requires to demonstrate the controller's \"legitimate interests\", with no reference to the intention or necessity of legal action. However, in this case, it would still be necessary to demonstrate that the legal actions have a minimum level of credibility. [ 23 ] Finally, a third interpretation is also possible. Upon closer examination, the phrase \" compelling legitimate grounds \" is followed by a first \" for \" (processing which overrides the interests, rights, and freedoms of the data subject) and a second \" for \" (the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims). According to a literal interpretation, the controller would therefore need to demonstrate \" compelling legitimate grounds \" in both the first and second cases. Having said that, the following analysis presents the prevailing opinion on this matter. The GDPR does not elaborate on what constitutes a \" compelling \" legitimate ground. However, the WP29 suggested in its \u2018Guidelines on Automated Individual Decision-Making\u2019 that processing may be based on a compelling legitimate ground where, instead of merely furthering the controller\u2019s business interests, it is \u201c beneficial for society at large (or the wider community) \u201d (e.g. \u201c profiling to predict the spread of a contagious disease) \u201d. [ 24 ] According to another opinion, \" compelling \" means that the legitimate interest must be overwhelming and override the data subject\u2019s interests \u201c in a strong, significant way. \u201d [ 25 ] Additionally, there can be no alternative ways to satisfy the controller\u2019s interest. [ 26 ] The EDPB emphasized that the assessment of what constitutes a compelling legitimate ground is different from the assessment of what is a legitimate interest and the balancing exercise under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR . \"If a data subject has invoked their right to object against a processing based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, it is not sufficient for the controller to just demonstrate that its earlier legitimate interest assessment regarding that processing was correct. The balancing test to be made under Article 21(1) GDPR is to be carried out in view of the particular situation of the data subject and requires the legitimate grounds invoked by the controller to be compelling, implying a higher threshold for overriding data subject objections. In other words, not all conceivable legitimate interests that may justify processing under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR are relevant in this context. Only interests that can be recognised as \u2018compelling\u2019 may be balanced against the rights, freedoms and interests of the data subject to assess whether there are grounds for processing that take precedence, despite the objection of the data subject. In essence, the grounds invoked should be essential to the controller (or to the third party in whose legitimate interest the data are being processed) to be considered compelling. This might be the case, for example, if a controller is compelled to process the personal data in order to protect its organisation or systems from serious immediate harm or from a severe penalty which would seriously affect its business. In contrast, showing that the processing would simply be beneficial or advantageous to the controller would not necessarily meet this threshold. The presence of compelling legitimate grounds needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis and be linked to a specific objection.\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 1/2024 on processing of personal data based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR', 8 October 2024 (Version 1), margin number 73. Footnotes omitted. Another factor to consider might be whether the controller's legitimate grounds are recognised as such by EU law (whether expressly or tacitly) [ 27 ] or is within the remaining scope for regulation by national law. This includes the interests and purposes outlined in Article 23(1)(a) to (j) GDPR (e.g. national and public security) as well as Recital 73 GDPR (e.g. protection of human life). In any case, the threshold is certainly higher than the overriding legitimate interest that a controller must demonstrate under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR , as any processing based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR would otherwise be essentially immune to objection. [ 28 ] Regarding the interplay of \" compelling legitimate grounds \" under this provision and \" overriding legitimate grounds \" under Article 17(1)(c) see Commentary on Article 17(1)(c) GDPR. A controller may also refuse to comply with an objection in case it processes the data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. It is not limited to the judicial claims but also includes out-of-court proceedings. [ 29 ] The provision applies when the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims is already underway or imminent; the mere possibility of future legal disputes is not sufficient to justify the further processing of data. [ 30 ] In cases of uncertainty regarding potential legal disputes, a balanced prognosis is required, considering factors such as the likelihood of a legal dispute, the significance of the claims involved, and the interests of the data subject. It is necessary for the (probability of) pursuing legal claims to outweigh the interests of the data subject in order to justify the continuation of data processing. [ 31 ] For more information on the establishment, excercise or defence of legal claims see Commentary on Article 9(2)(f) and Article 17(3)(e) GDPR. Article 21(2) GDPR gives data subjects an absolute right to object to the processing of their personal data for direct marketing purposes. It is a situation rather similar to data processing based on consent, where revocation does not need to be justified and it gives the data subject the option to stop the processing activity at any time. If direct marketing is based on consent, any objection by the data subject should be similarly considered as revoking the data subject's consent. [ 32 ] Unlike the scenario described in Article 21(1) GDPR, the data subject is not required to provide details about their specific situation. The objection takes effect upon the receipt of the request alone and there is no need for a balancing of interests by the controller, who cannot refuse the objection based on its compelling legitimate grounds. Furthermore, and again unlike under Article 21(1) GDPR, it is not necessary for the processing to be based on a specific legal basis ( Article 6(1)(f) or (e) of the GDPR ). The direct marketing purpose can be based on any legal ground, including the a contract with the data subject (assuming the processing for direct marketing purposes can indeed be based on such legal bases). [ 33 ] Regardless, the objection under Article 21(2) GDPR takes effect. Whilst \"direct marketing\" is not defined in the GDPR, its meaning can be derived from other EU and national laws. Pursuant to Article 2(a), Directive 2006/114/EC, \" advertising \" means \" the making of a representation in any form in connection with a trade, business, craft or profession in order to promote the supply of goods or services, including immovable property, rights and obligations \". It is irrelevant for whom the advertising is made. This includes not only direct advertising for the controller's own products or services, but also direct advertising for the benefit of third parties. Also irrelevant is whether or not the advertised content is communicated along other non-marketing materials. Direct advertising also occurs, for example, when commercial information is given in automatically generated confirmation e-mails. [ 34 ] Communications for non-commercial purposes, such as political, social or religious purposes are also covered by the definition. [ 35 ] For advertising (or marketing ) to be direct , it is necessary an underlying activity by which the user is singled out and addressed with promoting materials concerning the sale of goods or the provision of services. [ 36 ] Article 13 of Directive 2002/58/EC (e-Privacy Directive, consolidated version) states that this scenario includes the use of automated calling machines, telefaxes, and e-mails, including SMS messages (Recital 40, e-Privacy Directive). The extent to which online (targeted) advertising may be classified as \" direct marketing \" is not entirely clear, as it is unclear whether online advertising always falls within the scope of Article 13 of the e-Privacy Directive. As a matter of fact, there is room for a broad interpretation of such a provision. Sophisticated online targeted advertising techniques do single-out and specifically target individual users across the internet to promote goods or services, and in this way appear to satisfy direct marketing\u2019s key characteristics. [ 37 ] The CJEU case-law seems to support this latter interpretation, giving a broad and evolving meaning to the concept of the medium through which direct marketing is conveyed. In particular, the CJEU held that inbox advertising - the display of advertisements disguised as emails in an email inbox - is subjected to the e-Privacy directive, interpreted in line with the evolution of technological means. [ 38 ] In StWL St\u00e4dtische Werke Lauf , the CJEU supports a teleological, extensive and evolutive interpretation of the e-Privacy: \u201cFirst, Directive 2009/136, which amended Directive 2002/58, refers, in recital 67 thereof, to kinds of communication other than those mentioned in Directive 2002/58 when it states that the safeguards provided for subscribers against intrusion into their privacy by unsolicited communications for direct marketing purposes by means of electronic mail \u2018should also be applicable to SMS, MMS and other kinds of similar applications\u2019. Second, as specified in recital 4 of Directive 2002/58, the objective of providing an equal level of protection of personal data and privacy for users of publicly available electronic communications services must be ensured \u2018regardless of the technologies used\u2019, which confirms that it is necessary to adopt an interpretation that is broad, and evolving from a technological perspective, of the types of communication covered by that directive.\u201d \"Proceeding in that manner constitutes a use of electronic mail, within the meaning of Article 13(1) of Directive 2002/58, likely to breach the objective, pursued by that provision, of protecting users from any intrusion into their private life by unsolicited communications for the purposes of direct marketing.\" CJEU - C-102/20 - StWL St\u00e4dtische Werke Lauf a.d. Pegnitz , margin number 39, 45. See section above \" Including profiling based on Article 6(1)(f) or (e) \". Where a data subject objects to processing under Article 21(2) GDPR, all processing of their data for direct marketing purposes must stop. Processing of the personal data for other lawful purposes remains unaffected. [ 39 ] For the relationship between the objection for marketing purposes and the ground for deletion in case of such an objection, see Commentary on Article 17(1)(c) GDPR . In some cases, it can be advantageous for a data subject to avoid avoid an automatic deletion after an objection under Article 21(2) GDPR since the complete erasure makes it more likely that the controller recollects the affected data at some point after the deletion and accidentally uses them again for marketing purposes. The data subject could thus specify that their objection does not imply a complete deletion of all data. In such cases, including the data subject's contact information in an advertising blocking file is an appropriate measure to respect their preferences. [ 40 ] By maintaining this file, it can ensure that the data subject will not receive any future advertising, even if external data is utilized. As part of the notification process in accordance with Article 12(3) GDPR , data subjects should also be informed about the purpose of including their data in the blocking file. However, if the data subject requests the deletion of all data, they should be informed that they may receive advertising again in the future if third-party data is legally used. [ 41 ] If the controller is unsure how to interpret the wishes of the data subject, it can ask the data subject for a clarification. It should be recalled that Articles 13(2)(b) and 14(2)(c) GDPR already provide for the information to inform about the existence of the right to object to the processing of personal data. In addition, Article 21(4) GDPR specifies that the right to object under Article 21(1) and 21(2) GDPR (i.e. the right to object against processing based on a legitimate interest, necessary for a task in the public interest, and for direct marketing, respectively) must be communicated to the data subject explicitly , clearly , separately from other information , and at the latest at the time of the first communication . A controller should therefore make sure to comply with both information obligations in course of the data subject's information. [ 42 ] The requirement to provide the information in Article 21(4) GDPR in an explicit and clear way, and separate from other information should be read in conjunction with Article 12(1) GDPR which is also applicable and requires that the information is provided in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language (see Commentary on Article 12(1) GDPR ). The explicit and clear information about the right to object, should put the data subject in the position to effectively exercise this right. [ 43 ] Further, the information must be provided separately from other information, making it more likely, that the data subject actually notices the information. Therefore, the information should be optically highlighted. However, it is questionable if a highlighted section in the controller's privacy policy is sufficient to satisfy this requirement. [ 44 ] The French DPA has stated that information on the right to object should be provided in a distinct paragraph or pictogram. [ 45 ] Any indirect or implied reference to the right of objection will not satisfy Article 21(4) GDPR. [ 46 ] The notification under Article 21(4) GDPR must be made at the time of the first marketing communication, and not necessarily at the time that the data is first collected. However, if data is collected directly from the data subject, Article 13(2)(b) GDPR requires that the data subject will be informed of their right to object at the point that the data is collected from them. [ 47 ] Similarly, if Article 14(3) GDPR requires an earlier information, it must be provided at an earlier time. In accordance with Article 21(5) GDPR, the right to object in relation to the use of information society services (ISS) can be exercised using automated procedures and technical specifications. [ 48 ] Organisations can satisfy Article 21(5) GDPR by, inter alia, enabling a do-not-track function of the data subject\u2019s browser, [ 49 ] including an \" opt-out \" link in a direct marketing email, or by providing a Wi-Fi network that could detect a do-not-track signal from mobile phone users in a monitored area. [ 50 ] Article 21(5) GDPR applies \" notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC \". This means that this type of objection shall be implemented regardless of any e-Privacy conflicting regulations. This applies specifically to Article 14(1) e-Privacy under which no mandatory requirements for specific technical features are imposed on terminal or other electronic communication equipment which could impede the placing of equipment on the market and the free circulation of such equipment in and between Member States. For the purpose of enabling the automated exercise of the right to object, it is permissible to impose such mandatory requirements related to specific technical features. [ 51 ] Lastly, Article 21(6) GDPR gives users the right to object to processing for scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes, on grounds relating to their particular situation, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest. Controllers are therefore exempt from such an objection where processing is based on the first sentence of Article 6(1)(e) GDPR , but not the second sentence (i.e. where processing is necessary for the performance of a task in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller). In contrast to the right to object under Article 21(1) GDPR, where controllers process data necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interests, they do not need to demonstrate \" compelling legitimate grounds \" in order to refuse an objection to processing. As such, the threshold for refusing an objection is lower. The extent to which a controller would still need to carry out a balancing exercise of the importance of their task in the public interest and the objection in the interests of the data subject is not clear. Unlike Article 21(1) GDPR, Article 21(6) GDPR does not explicitly provide for this (note the lack of the word \" override \"). However, it is argued that the need for a balancing of interests naturally stems from the principle of proportionality in Article 52(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, and that Article 21(6) GDPR should be interpreted in light of this. [ 52 ] Similarly, the word \" unless \" in Article 21(6) GDPR implies that the burden of proof for rejecting an objection lies with the controller, meaning that the data subject\u2019s interest should take precedence in case of doubt. [ 53 ] Notably, unlike with Article 21(1) and (2) GDPR, the right to object under Article 21(6) GDPR does not need to explicitly be brought to the attention of the data subject under Article 21(4) GDPR. This may be attributable to the fact that data from a large number of data subjects are often processed during processing for research and statistical purposes, with the effect that satisfying Article 21(4) GDPR would likely be impractical or involve a disproportionate effort. [ 54 ] Controllers are nonetheless still obligated to notify data subjects of their right to object under Article 13(2)(b) GDPR and Article 14(2)(c) GDPR unless an exemption from the respective obligation applies. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 21 GDPR \u2191 Schrey , in R\u00fccker, Kugler, New European General Data Protection Regulation, A Practitioner's Guide: Ensuring Compliant Corporate Practice, p. 147 (C.H.

The GDPR reverses this burden of proof in the data subject\u2019s favour by requiring controllers to demonstrate \" compelling legitimate grounds \" if they intend to continue the processing activities.

The data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her. 2.   Paragraph 1 shall not apply if the decision: (a)   is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller; (b)   is authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests; or (c)   is based on the data subject's explicit consent. 3.   In the cases referred to in points (a) and (c) of paragraph 2, the data controller shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and to contest the decision. 4.   Decisions referred to in paragraph 2 shall not be based on special categories of personal data referred to in Article 9(1), unless point (a) or (g) of Article 9(2) applies and suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests are in place. The data subject should have the right not to be subject to a decision, which may include a measure, evaluating personal aspects relating to him or her which is based solely on automated processing and which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her, such as automatic refusal of an online credit application or e-recruiting practices without any human intervention. Such processing includes \u2018profiling\u2019 that consists of any form of automated processing of personal data evaluating the personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning the data subject's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences or interests, reliability or behaviour, location or movements, where it produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her. However, decision-making based on such processing, including profiling, should be allowed where expressly authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject, including for fraud and tax-evasion monitoring and prevention purposes conducted in accordance with the regulations, standards and recommendations of Union institutions or national oversight bodies and to ensure the security and reliability of a service provided by the controller, or necessary for the entering or performance of a contract between the data subject and a controller, or when the data subject has given his or her explicit consent. In any case, such processing should be subject to suitable safeguards, which should include specific information to the data subject and the right to obtain human intervention, to express his or her point of view, to obtain an explanation of the decision reached after such assessment and to challenge the decision. Such measure should not concern a child. Article 22 GDPR regulates so called automated individual decision-making (ADM). ADM refers to a decision made by the controller solely on automated processing (i.e. no meaningful human intervention) which produces either some legal effect concerning a data subject or similarly significantly affects them. This is a process that is widely used in an increasing area of situations, both in the public and private sector. E.g. ADM is widely used in Banking and Finance, healthcare, taxation, insurance, marketing and advertising. [ 1 ] Article 22(1) GDPR provides for a description of a ADM as well as for the general prohibition of ADM. Article 22(2) GDPR provides for three exemptions from this general prohibition. Namely, where ADM is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller; where it is authorised by EU or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject\u2019s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests; or where it is based on the data subject\u2019s explicit consent. Article 22(3) GDPR requires controllers to implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests in case the ADM is based on the necessity to enter into, or perform a contract, or with the data subject's explicit consent. In case ADM is based on Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject, such law already must lay down such suitable measures. This Paragraph also specifies that the safeguards implemented by the controller must at least provide for the data subject's right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express their point of view and to contest the decision. Finally, Article 22(4) GDPR sets further requirements for ADM based on special categories of personal data ( Article 9(1) GDPR ). Such ADM is only permissible, in case the data subject explicitly consented to the ADM or it is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of Union or Member State law, and suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests are in place. WP29 Guidelines : see WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Automated individual decision-making and Profiling for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP251 rev.01, 6 February 2018, (available here ). Article 22(1) GDPR defines the scope of ADM as any decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning a data subject or similarly significantly affects them. At the same time, this provision provides for a general prohibition of ADM. On the first glance, the wording of the provision (\"shall have the right\") indicates a mere data subject's right; however, the provision has to be understood as a prohibition in principle, which does not need to be invoked by the data subject to have an effect on the controller. [ 2 ] \"Article 22(1) of the GDPR confers on the data subject the \u2018right\u2019 not to be the subject of a decision solely based on automated processing, including profiling. That provision lays down a prohibition in principle, the infringement of which does not need to be invoked individually by such a person.\" CJEU - C\u2011634/21 - SCHUFA Holding (Scoring) , margin number 52. The term \u201cright\u201d in the provision does not mean that Article 22(1) applies only when actively invoked by the data subject. Article 22(1) establishes a general prohibition for decision-making based solely on automated processing. This prohibition applies whether or not the data subject takes an action regarding the processing of their personal data. WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Automated individual decision-making and Profiling for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP251 rev.01, 6 February 2018, p. 19. Article 22(1) GDPR clarifies that ADM is any decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning a data subject or similarly significantly affects them. Therefore, 3 cumulative conditions have to be met in order for a processing activity to constitute ADM: The controller must make a decision; The decision must be based solely on automated processing, including profiling; and The decision must produce legal effects concerning the data subject or similarly significantly affect them. The applicability of [Article 22(1) GDPR] is therefore subject to three cumulative conditions, namely, first, that there must be a \u2018decision\u2019, secondly, that that decision must be \u2018based solely on automated processing, including profiling\u2019, and, thirdly, that it must produce \u2018legal effects concerning [the interested party]\u2019 or \u2018similarly significantly [affect] him or her\u2019.\" CJEU - C\u2011634/21 - SCHUFA Holding (Scoring) , margin number 43. The title of Article 22 GDPR further suggests that the scope is limited to automated individual decision-making, i.e. a decision concerning an individual data subject. This requirement can also be derived from the 3 cumulative conditions mentioned above and requires that the decision is made with regard to an individual, excluding abstract decisions like implementing rules or guidelines subject to numerous data subjects and strategic decisions like the discontinuation of a business segment. [ 3 ] The first condition required to trigger Article 22 GPDR is the presence of a \"decision\", which can be interpreted in a broad sense. [ 4 ] Examples of a decision can be official acts of public authorities such as decisions on tax returns, [ 5 ] as well as automatic refusals of online credit applications or similar decisions in the context of e-recruiting practices. [ 6 ] Although there does not seem to be a specific requirement for the decision to be formalised in a particular way, it should at least be distinguishable from other stages of the decision-making process. \"As regards, first, the condition relating to the existence of a decision, it should be noted that the concept of \u2018decision\u2019, within the meaning of Article 22(1) of the GDPR, is not defined by that regulation. However, it is apparent from the very wording of that provision that that concept refers not only to acts which produce legal effects concerning the person at issue but also to acts which similarly significantly affect him or her. The broad scope of the concept of \u2018decision\u2019 is confirmed by recital 71 of the GDPR, according to which a decision evaluating personal aspects relating to a person, to which that person should have the right not to be subject, \u2018may include a measure\u2019 which either produces \u2018legal effects concerning him or her\u2019, or, \u2018similarly significantly affects him or her\u2019. Under that recital, the term \u2018decision\u2019 covers, for example, the automatic refusal of an online credit application or e-recruiting practices without human intervention. The concept of \u2018decision\u2019 within the meaning of Article 22(1) of the GDPR is thus [...] capable of including a number of acts which may affect the data subject in many ways, since that concept is broad enough to encompass the result of calculating a person\u2019s creditworthiness in the form of a probability value concerning that person\u2019s ability to meet payment commitments in the future.\" CJEU - C 634/21 - SCHUFA Holding (Scoring) , margin number 44 et seqq. The second condition requires that the decision is based solely on automated processing, including profiling. [ 7 ] For a processing activity to be based solely on automated processing, there must be no human involvement in the decision process. However, in order for human involvement to prevent the applicability of Article 22(1) GDPR, the involvement has to be meaningful; i.e. the intervention must be meaningful and not just a pretext in order to avoid the consequences of Article 22 GDPR. [ 8 ] Human intervention can only be considered meaningful, in case it is carried out by someone who has the authority and competence to change the decision and the human involved exercise this competence by consider ing all the relevant data and verifying the substance and correctness of the machine-generated decision. [ 9 ] Therefore, it should be considered, whether human intervention is even possible from a technical perspective, or whether the decision-making process is constructed in a solely algorithmic way with no room for human involvement. For example: A online-retailer decides in real time whether it sends goods to customers without prior payment (buy now - pay later) based on the customers profile. If an employee of the retailer screes hundreds of purchases per hour simply \"confirming\" the automated decision based on the customer's profile, this is not sufficient to be considered meaningful human intervention. The controller cannot avoid the Article 22 provisions by fabricating human involvement. For example, if someone routinely applies automatically generated profiles to individuals without any actual influence on the result, this would still be a decision based solely on automated processing. WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Automated individual decision-making and Profiling for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP251 rev.01, 6 February 2018, p. 21. Further, the \"automated processing\" criterion in Article 22(1) GDPR is related to the final stage of the processing, which results in a solely automated decision based on already existing data. By contrast, the methods of collecting the initial data sources must not necessarily be automated, and can be semi-automated or even manual. [ 10 ] Article 4(4) GDPR defines profiling as any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements. [ 11 ] For example, automated credit scoring falls under the definition of profiling: As regards, secondly, the condition according to which the decision, within the meaning of that Article 22(1), must be \u2018based solely on automated processing, including profiling\u2019, [...] it is common ground that an activity such as that of SCHUFA meets the definition of \u2018profiling\u2019 appearing in Article 4(4) of the GDPR and therefore that that condition is met in the present case, since the wording of the first question referred explicitly refers to the automated establishment of a probability value based on personal data relating to a person and concerning that person\u2019s ability to repay a loan in the future. CJEU - C 634/21 - SCHUFA Holding (Scoring) , margin number 47. It should be noted however, that not all profiling leads to ADM; if a decision is based on profiling, but there is meaningful human intervention involved, Article 22 GDPR is not applicable. [ 12 ] Automated decisions can be made with or without profiling; profiling can take place without making automated decisions. However, profiling and automated decision-making are not necessarily separate activities. Something that starts off as a simple automated decision-making process could become one based on profiling, depending upon how the data is used. [...] Decisions that are not solely automated might also include profiling. WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Automated individual decision-making and Profiling for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP251 rev.01, 6 February 2018, p. 8. A decision has legal effects on a data subject when it is binding and affects the person\u2019s rights. [ 13 ] It is not necessary, that the legal effect is negative for the data subject; a positive legal effect is also a legal effect in accordance with this provision. [ 14 ] A legal effect requires that the decision, which is based on solely automated processing, affects someone\u2019s legal rights, such as the freedom to associate with others, vote in an election, or take legal action. A legal effect may also be something that affects a person\u2019s legal status or their rights under a contract. Examples of this type of effect include automated decisions about an individual that result in: - cancellation of a contract; - entitlement to or denial of a particular social benefit granted by law, such as child or housing benefit; - refused admission to a country or denial of citizenship. WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Automated individual decision-making and Profiling for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP251 rev.01, 6 February 2018, p. 21. In principle, satisfying this criterion means that the impacts of the decision must be considerable despite not changing the legal position of the individual. While it can be difficult to establish this in practice, according to the WP29 some guiding criteria for similarly significant effects include: significantly affects the circumstances, behaviour or choices of the individuals concerned; has a prolonged or permanent impact on the data subject; or at its most extreme, leads to the exclusion or discrimination of individuals. [ 15 ] The WP29 also gives examples of decisions that can have effects which are similarly significant to legal ones. These include decisions that: affect someone\u2019s financial circumstances, such as their eligibility to credit; affect someone\u2019s access to health services; deny someone an employment opportunity or put them at a serious disadvantage; affect someone\u2019s access to education, for example university admissions. [ 16 ] In any case, the decision should have more than just a trivial effect, and impact someone\u2019s position either in relation to other persons, or to access a service or opportunity. For example, Recital 71 GDPR mentions the \u201cautomatic refusal of an online credit application or e-recruiting practices without human intervention\u201d. Similarly, the CJEU found that credit rating performed by an credit information agency can have significant effects on the data subject: [I]n the event where a loan application is sent by a consumer to a bank, an insufficient probability value leads, in almost all cases, to the refusal of that bank to grant the loan applied for. In those circumstances, it must be stated that the third condition to which the application of Article 22(1) of the GDPR is subject is also fulfilled, since a probability value such as that at issue in the main proceedings affects, at the very least, the data subject significantly. It follows that, in circumstances such as those at issue in the main proceedings, in which the probability value established by a credit information agency and communicated to a bank plays a determining role in the granting of credit, the establishment of that value must be qualified in itself as a decision producing vis-\u00e0-vis a data subject \u2018legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly [affecting] him or her\u2019 within the meaning of Article 22(1) of the GDPR.\" CJEU - C 634/21 - SCHUFA Holding (Scoring) , margin number 48 et seqq. Decisions resulting in targeted advertisement based on profiling could also significantly affect individuals, for example, when someone is targeted with high interest loans because they are known to be in financial difficulties and are particularly susceptible to accept such offers. In this context, the WP29 lays down a non-exhaustive list of characteristics that can be decisive in the assessment of each case, such as: the intrusiveness of the profiling process, including the tracking of individuals across different websites, devices and services; the expectations and wishes of the individuals concerned; the way the advert is delivered; or using knowledge of the vulnerabilities of the data subjects targeted. [ 17 ] While Article 22(1) GDPR provides for a general prohibition of ADM, Article 22(2) GDPR provides for some exemptions of this prohibitions. In other words, ADM is only permissible, in case one of those conditions is met. The first exception from the prohibition laid down in Article 22(1) GDPR applies if the decision is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between the data subject and the controller. For an interpretation of the criterion of necessity see Commentary on Article 6(1) GDPR . This means, that the ADM is not just useful, but necessary for entering into, or the performance of a contract. \"The controller must be able to show that this type of processing is necessary, taking into account whether a less privacy-intrusive method could be adopted. 35 If other effective and less intrusive means to achieve the same goal exist, then it would not be \u2018necessary\u2019.\" WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Automated individual decision-making and Profiling for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP251 rev.01, 6 February 2018, p. 23. As stated by the WP29, this exemption is also applicable if ADM is necessary for pre-contractual processing. [ 18 ] For example: A online-retailer receives hundreds of purchase orders each minute. An algorithm is utilized in order to filter out existing customers with a trouble-free purchase history and automatically sends out purchase confirmations. The manual screening of each purchase would be unfeasible for the retailer. In any case, the application of Article 22(2)(a) GDPR is always subjected to the presence of \u201csuitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and to contest the decision\u201d (see below on Article 22(3) GDPR). Article 22(2)(b) GDPR provides for the second exemption from the prohibition of ADM in case it is authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and such law also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests. (Regarding the requirement to provide suitable safeguards, see Commentary on Article 22(3) GDPR below.) Regarding the suitable measures, these have to include the specific measures mentioned in Article 22(3) GDPR, i.e. the data subject's right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express their point of view and to contest the decision. [ 19 ] While the wording of the provision seems to suggest that such measures do not necessarily need to be the same as those foreseen by Article 22(3) GDPR and leave discretion to the Member States, [ 20 ] the CJEU clarified that these also apply to Article 22(2)(b) GDPR: \"With regard, more specifically, to Article 22(2)(b) of the GDPR, to which the referring court refers, it is apparent from the very wording of that provision that the national law which authorises the adoption of an automated individual decision must lay down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject\u2019s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests. In the light of recital 71 of the GDPR, such measures must include, in particular, the obligation for the controller to use appropriate mathematical or statistical procedures, implement technical and organisational measures appropriate to ensure that the risk of errors is minimised and inaccuracies are corrected, and secure personal data in a manner that takes account of the potential risks involved for the interests and rights of the data subject and prevent, inter alia, discriminatory effects on that person. Those measures include, moreover, at least the right for the data subject to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and to challenge the decision taken in his or her regard.\" CJEU - C 634/21 - SCHUFA Holding (Scoring) , margin number 65 et seq. The CJEU case law suggests, that any Member State law authorising ADM in accordance with Article 22(2)(b) GDPR have to comply with Article 6(3) GDPR , i.e. requirements for national law providing for legal obligations of the controller ( Article 6(1)(c) GDPR ) or determining a public interest ( Article 6(1)(e) GDPR ). For now, it remains an rather open question, whether a controller invoking Article 22(2)(b) GDPR has to similarly base the ADM on Article 6(1)(c) GDPR or Article 6(1)(e) GDPR or if also other legal bases (mainly legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR ) can be invoked in this case. \"Thus, in the event that the law of a Member State authorises, under Article 22(2)(b) of the GDPR, the adoption of a decision solely based on automated processing, that processing must comply not only with the conditions set out in the latter provision and in Article 22(4) of that regulation, but also with the requirements set out in Articles 5 and 6 of that regulation. Accordingly, Member States cannot adopt, under Article 22(2)(b) of the GDPR, regulations which authorise profiling in disregard of the requirements laid down by those Articles 5 and 6, as interpreted by the case-law of the Court. With regard in particular to the conditions of lawfulness, provided for in Article 6(1)(a), (b), and (f) of the GDPR, which are likely to apply in a case such as that at issue in the main proceedings, Member States are not empowered to provide additional rules for the implementation of those conditions, such an option being, in accordance with Article 6(3) of that regulation, limited to the reasons referred to in Article 6(1)(c) and (e) of that regulation.\" CJEU - C 634/21 - SCHUFA Holding (Scoring) , margin number 68 et seq. Also, the EDPB pointed out that Article 6(1)(f) GDPR can not be considered a law authorising automated decision making within the meaning of this provision. [ 21 ] The third and last exemption from the prohibition of ADM in Article 22(1) GDPR applies if it is based on the data subject's explicit consent . The wording of Article 22(2)(c) GDPR (\u201cexplicit consent\u201d) results in the same standard for this requirement as Article 9(2)(a) GDPR . Particular attention must be given to consent being freely given in the context of entering into or performance of a contract. [ 22 ] For more information on the interpretation of the term \"explicit consent\" see Commentary on Article 9(2)(a) GDPR . \"Article 22 requires explicit consent. Processing that falls within the definition of Article 22(1) poses significant data protection risks and a high level of individual control over personal data is therefore deemed appropriate.\" WP29, \u2018Guidelines on Automated individual decision-making and Profiling for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 17/EN WP251 rev.01, 6 February 2018, p. 24. Any decision based on the data subject's explicit consent is also subjected to the safeguards laid down in Article 22(3) GDPR (see Commentary on Article 22(3) GDPR bellow.) In case ADM is based on contractual necessity (Article 22(2)(a) GDPR)  or the data subject's explicit consent (Article 22(2)(c) GDPR), Article 22(3) requires controllers to implement suitable measures to safeguard data subjects\u2019 rights freedoms and legitimate interests. As mentioned above, in case ADM is authorised by Member or Union State law (Article 22(2)(b) GDPR) such law must also incorporate appropriate safeguarding measures. Therefore, Article 22(3) GDPR lays down some safeguards which must be available to the data subjects in case of automated decision-making carried out under Article 22(2)(a) and (c) GDPR. I.e. the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express the data subject\u2019s point of view and to contest the decision. However, this list is not exhaustive and the controller might have to implement further safeguards. These rights maintain a unifying element: in order to be exercised, they all require some kind of prior information that only the controller can provide. Take, for example, the right to challenge the decision. In order to do so, it is necessary to know which elements have been taken into account by the algorithm and what its logic is, albeit in summary form. Conversely, it would be logically impossible to challenge the decision. The same applies to the right to obtain human intervention. In order to meaningfully exercise it, it is necessary to know at least what procedure the data subject has to follow and which criteria guide the reviewer\u2019s decision. Otherwise, it would be completely impossible to express one's own point of view. It should therefore be noted that the controller's information obligation as well as the right of access provides for an obligation to inform data subjects about the ADM, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject. [ 23 ] \"Furthermore, in the case of automated decision-making, such as that referred to in Article 22(1) of the GDPR, first, the controller is subject to additional information obligations under Article 13(2)(f) and Article 14(2)(g) of that regulation. Secondly, the data subject enjoys, under Article 15(1)(h) of that regulation, the right to obtain from the controller, in particular, \u2018meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject\u2019.\" CJEU - C 634/21 - SCHUFA Holding (Scoring) , margin number 56. Pursuant to Article 12(1) GDPR , which expressly refers to Article 22, the controller \" shall take appropriate measures \" to provide the information required \" in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language \". In the light of the above, the controller is obliged to provide an explanation of ADM, enabling data subjects to exercise their rights provided for in Article 22(3) GDPR. [ 24 ] \"It is apparent from the examination of the purposes of the GDPR and, in particular, those of Article 15(1)(h) thereof that the right to obtain \u2018meaningful information about the logic involved\u2019 in automated decision-making, within the meaning of that provision, must be understood as a right to an explanation of the procedure and principles actually applied in order to use, by automated means, the personal data of the data subject with a view to obtaining a specific result, such as a credit profile. In order to enable the data subject effectively to exercise the rights conferred on him or her by the GDPR and, in particular, Article 22(3) thereof, that explanation must be provided by means of relevant information and in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form.\" CJEU - C\u2011203/22 - Dun & Bradstreet Austria , margin number 58. However, clarifications will still be needed as to how the safeguards already mentioned by Article 22(3) GDPR can be operationalised and what their outcome will be. With regards to the legal consequences of the data subject expressing their point of view or contesting the decision, it is not clear from this provision how or by who contentious issues should be resolved in practice. [ 25 ] In addition, effective implementation of a right to explanation faces both legal and technical issues. On the one hand, the problem arises of how to balance such a data subject's right with intellectual property rights and industrial secrets of the controller. On the other hand, due to the current level of development of machine learning technologies, it may be difficult for the controller to explain in details the logic behind processes partly beyond human understanding. However, from a legal perspective, the controllers should make sure to use algorithms or tools for ADM they understand well enough to explain and influence their functioning and effects in practice. Article 22(4) GDPR stipulates that any ADM permissible under Article 22(2) GDPR must not be based on special categories of personal data ( Article 9(1) GDPR ) unless the data subject has given their explicit consent in accordance with Article 9(2)(a) GDPR or the processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest in accordance with Article 9(2)(g) GDPR . In addition, the controller must put in place suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests. This provision is supposed to counteract the particular potential for discrimination in case ADM is based on sensitive data. [ 26 ] Explicit consent in the context of Article 22(4) GDPR should be interpreted in a similar manner as to Article 22(2)(c) GDPR. The suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, should depend on the particular sensitivity of the processed data and potential consequences of the ADM.

Union or Member State law to which the data controller or processor is subject may restrict by way of a legislative measure the scope of the obligations and rights provided for in Articles 12 to 22 and Article 34, as well as Article 5 in so far as its provisions correspond to the rights and obligations provided for in Articles 12 to 22, when such a restriction respects the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and is a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard: 2.   In particular, any legislative measure referred to in paragraph 1 shall contain specific provisions at least, where relevant, as to: Data protection principles, data subject rights and controller obligations are not absolute. Article 23 GDPR gives Member States and the EU legislator the option to implement restrictions of certain parts of the GDPR by legislative measures. In other words, these provisions might be limited, restricted or lightened by way of Union or Member State law. However, in order to be lawful such limitations must fulfill the requirements set out in Article 23 GDPR. In particular, the measure must respects the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and must be a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard one of the goals mentioned in the (exhaustive) [ 1 ] list in Article 23(1) GDPR. Such goals are e.g. national and security, protection of judicial independence and proceedings, and the enforcement of civil law claims. Article 23(2) lists a number of specific provisions, such legislative measures restricting data protection principles, data subject rights or controller obligations should contain. E.g. purpose and categories of processing, scope of the restriction, safeguards to prevent abuse, specification of the controllers. EDPB Guidelines : EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 10/2020 on restrictions under Article 23 GDPR\u2019, 13 October 2021 (Version 2.0) (available here ). The right to personal data protection is laid down in Article 8 CFR. This right, as is underlined by the CJEU, [ 2 ] is relative, not absolute. Hence, Article 52(1) CFR allows the enactment of limitations to this right, if the provisions\u2019 requirements are fulfilled. Following this rationale, Article 23 GDPR allows Member States and the Union to restrict, limit, or lighten the rights of the data subject, \u201cprovided for in Articles 12 to 22, Article 34, as well as Article 5 in so far as its provisions correspond to the rights and obligations provided for in Articles 12 to 22\u201d. While the term \"restriction\" is not defined in the GDPR, it can be interpreted in referring to any limitation of scope of the obligations and rights provided for in Articles 12 to 22 and 34 GDPR as well as corresponding provisions of Article 5 in accordance with Article 23 GDPR. [ 3 ] \"Restrictions should be seen as exceptions to the general rule allowing the exercise of rights and imposing the obligations enshrined in the GDPR. As such, restrictions should be interpreted narrowly, only be applied in specifically provided circumstances and only when certain conditions are met.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 10/2020 on restrictions under Article 23 GDPR\u2019, 13 October 2021 (Version 2.0), margin number 3. Moreover, even when restrictions apply, the accountability principle remains relevant ( Article 5(2) GDPR ). Hence, controllers must always be able to demonstrate compliance with the EU data protection framework. [ 4 ] Lastly, the legislator must assess whether the restriction is limited to what is strictly necessary. [ 5 ] In particular, the protection of personal data cannot be excluded completely: \"Even in exceptional situations, the protection of personal data cannot be restricted in its entirety. It must be upheld in all emergency measures, as per Article 23 GDPR thus contributing to the respect of the overarching values of democracy, rule of law and fundamental rights on which the Union is founded: any measure taken by Member States shall respect the general principles of law, the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and shall not be irreversible and data controllers and processors shall continue to comply with data protection rules.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 10/2020 on restrictions under Article 23 GDPR\u2019, 13 October 2021 (Version 2.0), margin number 4. Under Article 23(1) GDPR, the legislative measure can only interfere with the \u201c obligations and rights provided for in Articles 12 to 22 and Article 34, as well as [the principles in] Article 5 \". Therefore, the rights and obligations which can be restricted are those to: transparent information, communication and modalities for the exercise of the rights of the data subject ( Article 12 GDPR ), information ( Articles 13 and 14 GDPR ), access ( Article 15 GDPR ), rectification ( Article 16 GDPR ), erasure ( Article 17 GDPR ), restriction of processing ( Article 18 GDPR ), notification obligation regarding rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing ( Article 19 GDPR ), data portability ( Article 20 GDPR ), object ( Article 21 GDPR ), prohibition of automated individual decision making ( Article 22 GDPR ), and Communication of a personal data breach to the data subject ( Article 34 GDPR ). Also, processing principles under Article 5 GDPR can be restricted in so far as its provisions correspond to the rights and obligations provided for in the above mentioned Articles. This means that any other data subjects\u2019 rights, such as the right to lodge a complaint to the supervisory authority ( Article 77 GDPR ), or other controller obligations, cannot be restricted under this provision. However, it should be noted that Chapter IX of the GDPR provides further provisions allowing for (more extensive) restrictions to the GDPR, e.g. processing for journalistic purposes. See Commentary on Article 85 to 91 GDPR. Article 23 GDPR requires that the restriction imposed by the Union or a Member State must be specified by way of a legislative measure, i.e. by Union or Member State law that the controller or processor is subject to. Without such a legislative measure, controllers cannot rely on the grounds listed in Article 23(1) GDPR in order to restrict provisions of the GDPR. [ 6 ] As Recital 41 specifies, this legislative measure must not necessarily be a legislative act adopted by a parliament. See Commentary on Article 6(3) GDPR on more information on what constitutes a legislative measure. What is important is that the legislative measure must be clear and precise , so that its application is foreseeable to persons subject to it. [ 7 ] For this requirement to be fulfilled, citizens need to have an adequate indication of the circumstances and conditions under which controllers can impose such restrictions. [ 8 ] \"In particular, the domestic law must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give individuals an adequate indication of the circumstances in and conditions under which controllers are empowered to resort to any such restrictions.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 10/2020 on restrictions under Article 23 GDPR\u2019, 13 October 2021 (Version 2.0), margin number 17. According to the EDPB, restrictions must not necessarily be limited in time or linked to a timeframe, to meet the foreseeability criterion. [ 9 ] In this respect, the restrictive measure must be sufficiently clear and give citizens an adequate indication of the circumstances that justify controllers to invoke it lawfully. [ 10 ] It could be that the ground for the restriction is not limited in time because that ground needs to be safeguarded permanently, i.e., safeguarding the protection of judicial independence and judicial proceedings. Of course, this needs to be assessed in light of the principle of necessity and proportionality. However, if the ground for restriction is, in itself, limited in time, (i.e., because of a state of emergency) the restriction must also be limited in time, and cannot work retroactively. Lastly, the legislative measure should clearly state how the restriction serves the objective. [ 11 ] \"For instance, the mere existence of a pandemic alone is not a sufficient reason to provide for any kind of restriction on the rights of data subjects; rather, any restriction shall clearly contribute to the safeguard of an important objective of general public interest of the Union or of a Member State.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 10/2020 on restrictions under Article 23 GDPR\u2019, 13 October 2021 (Version 2.0), margin number 19. Restrictions under Article 23(1) GDPR need to respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms. This means that any restriction that renders the fundamental right that is being restricted void of its content cannot be justified. Hence, a general exclusion of data subjects\u2019 rights with regard to all processing operations would not respect the essence. The same goes for a general limitation to the rights mentioned in Article 23 GDPR of all data subjects, even if this relates to specific data processing operations or concerns specific controllers. [ 12 ] \"If the essence of the right is compromised, the restriction shall be considered unlawful, without the need to further assess whether it serves an objective of general interest or satisfies the necessity and proportionality criteria\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 10/2020 on restrictions under Article 23 GDPR\u2019, 13 October 2021 (Version 2.0), margin number 14. Restrictions under Article 23(1) GDPR further need to be a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard one of the goals listed in Article 32(1) GDPR. \"[R]estrictions that are extensive and intrusive to the extent that they void a fundamental right of its basic content, cannot be justified. In any case, a general exclusion of data subjects' rights with regard to all or specific data processing operations or with regard to specific controllers would not respect the essence of the fundamental right to the protection of personal data, as enshrined in the Charter.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 10/2020 on restrictions under Article 23 GDPR\u2019, 13 October 2021 (Version 2.0), margin number 14. Therefore, a necessity and proportionality test is required to be carried out before the legislator can implement a restriction in compliance with Article 23(1) GDPR. [ 13 ] First, the necessity of a restriction must be assessed. The EDPB notes that one must identify the objective in sufficient detail to assess whether the objective is necessary. If, for example, a restriction is grounded on Article 23(1)(d) GDPR, but some information can be disclosed without jeopardising an\u00a0 investigation, then it must be disclosed. [ 14 ] The CJEU applies a test of strict necessity when assessing any limitation to the rights to personal data protection, and privacy. [ 15 ] The ECtHR maintains the same benchmark depending on the context,\u00a0for example in the case of secret surveillance measures. [ 16 ] If, and only when, the necessity of the measure is proven, will its proportionality be assessed. If the measure exceeds what is strictly necessary to safeguard the objectives listed in Article 23(1)(a) to (j), this measure is not proportionate. [ 17 ] The EDPB lists La Quadrature du net and others [ 18 ] as an example of CJEU case law where the state did not adhere to what was strictly necessary by requiring service providers\u00a0to provide access to personal data generally and indiscriminately . Lastly, any proposed restriction measure should be accompanied with evidence proving why the measure is necessary and proportionate. [ 19 ] Hence, it should describe the problem addressed, how it will be addressed, why other less intrusive measures don\u2019t suffice, and demonstrate how this measure meets the State\u2019s or EU\u2019s objective. The EDPB mentions \u201c restrictions [that] contribute to safeguarding public health in a state of emergency \u201d as an example, and stipulates that a measure can only restrict the data subject\u2019s rights, but not deny them. [ 20 ] In this regard, the EDPB also recalls that Article 5 GDPR is one of the most important provisions of the GDPR, and argues that restrictions to the principles need to be justified by an exceptional situation. Moreover, provisions of Article 5 GDPR that do not correspond to the rights and obligations in Articles 12 to 22 GDPR cannot be restricted. [ 21 ] Any legislative measure providing for a restriction under Article 23(1) GDPR must be necessary and proportionate to safeguard one of the goals (i.e. qualified public interests) listed in this provision.  The grounds for restrictions are exhaustively listed in Article 23(1) GDPR. It should be noted that this is an exhaustive list and restrictions cannot be imposed to safeguard other goals. [ 22 ] Further, any provision implementing a restriction of the GDPR should make the link to the pursued objective sufficiently clear. [ 23 ] These grounds, listed in Article 23(1)(a)-(c) GDPR are closely related. National security refers to both the internal, and external security of Member States. [ 24 ] Public security covers the protection of human life, particularly in cases of natural or manmade disasters. [ 25 ] Article 32(1)(d) GDPR provides for the safeguard of \" the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security \" as a goal potentially justifying a restriction under Article 23 GDPR. When personal data is processed for\u00a0these specific purposes by a competent authority, the GDPR does not apply, since this processing is within the scope of the Law Enforcement Directive. [ 26 ] However, Recital 19 GDPR clarifies that, when a private (non-competent) body processes personal data for the above-mentioned purposes, the GDPR does apply. Moreover, the Recital explains that this is relevant, for example, \u201c in the framework of anti-money laundering or the activities of forensic laboratories \u201d. However, once the omitted information can no longer jeopardise the investigation\u00a0 being carried out, it must be provided. [ 27 ] This provision provides for the (rather broad) goal of \" other important objectives of general public interest of the Union or of a Member State, in particular an important economic or financial interest of the Union or of a Member State, including monetary, budgetary and taxation a matters, public health and social security \". \"It may concern for instance the keeping of public registers kept for reasons of general public interest or the further processing of archived personal data to provide specific information related to the political behaviour under former totalitarian state regimes.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 10/2020 on restrictions under Article 23 GDPR\u2019, 13 October 2021 (Version 2.0), margin number 27 footnotes omitted. As noted by the EDPB, a financial burden on public budgets to comply with the data subjects\u2019 rights are not sufficient to justify a public interest to restrict these rights. As an example, the EDPB also stipulates that any restriction by a Tax Administration to the data subject\u2019s right of access, is only justified if this person is under an investigation by this administration, and the right of access would jeopardise the investigation. Moreover, this restriction must be lifted as soon as the investigation is over. When such a restriction is justified, appropriate safeguards like indirect access (when the supervisory authority exercises the right on behalf of the data subject to verify whether the restriction is lawful) must be implemented. Lastly, the EDPB has mentioned, for example, that in order to ensure a public interest objective related to the accessibility of the law, a public administration could restrict the right to object to the processing of pseudonymised personal data if it\u2019s used to develop\u00a0 a benchmark document that clarifies which compensation is fair according to a certain type of damage. However, it also notes that this kind of restriction may take place only when appropriate safeguards are in place. [ 28 ] Another public interest capable of justifying restrictions to the GDPR lies in \" the protection of judicial independence and judicial proceedings \". The EDPB mentions that the scope of these restrictions should be aligned with national legislation regulating these matters. [ 29 ] \"Those objectives include, in accordance with Article 23(1)(f) of that regulation, \u2018the protection of judicial independence and judicial proceedings\u2019, which [...] must be understood as referring to the protection of the administration of justice from internal or external interference, but also to the proper administration of justice. CJEU - C-268/21 - Norra Stockholm Bygg , margin number 38. This ground does not include criminal proceedings, since in such\u00a0cases, Article 23(1)(d) GDPR applies. [ 30 ] \" The prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of breaches of ethics for regulated professions \" is another goal listed in Article 23(1) GDPR. In other words, breaches of ethics for regulated professions (one can think of medical doctors or lawyers) are also a ground for restrictions. As in the previous provision, the EDPB notes that this ground only applies in cases where there is no criminal offence (in which case\u00a0Article 23(1)(d) GDPR would also apply). [ 31 ] Article 32(1)(h) GDPR provides for the goal of safeguarding \" a monitoring, inspection or regulatory function connected, even occasionally, to the exercise of official authority in the cases referred to in points (a) to (e) and (g) \". This ground expands on some of\u00a0the grounds listed in this section by clearly stating that, limitations to data subjects\u2019 rights and controllers\u2019 obligations can also be justified, to safeguard a monitoring, inspection or regulatory function, if these are connected to the exercise or official authority of the grounds of national security (Article 23(1)(a) GDPR), other important objectives of general public interest (Article 23(1)(e) GDPR), and the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of breaches of ethics for regulated professions (Article 23(1)(g) GDPR). [ 32 ] Arguably, this provision has a mere clarifying purpose since the mentioned provisions would already cover the monitoring, inspection and regulatory function connected with those goals. [ 33 ] There are also cases where a data subject\u2019s rights can be limited to protect other data subjects. Therefore, Article 23(1)(i) GDPR lists \" the protection of the data subject or the rights and freedoms of others \" as a ground potentially justifying restrictions to the GDPR under Article 23 GDPR. As an example, the EDPB lists administrative inquiries, disciplinary proceedings or investigations on allegations of harassment in the workplace. In such cases, the person subject to these proceedings\u2019 right of access could be restricted to protect an alleged victim or witness whistle-blower from retaliation, or conversely, the latter might see their right of access restricted to respect the privacy and data protection rights of the former. [ 34 ] Lastly, Article 23(1)(j) GDPR includes the enforcement of civil law claims as a ground for restrictions. \"While Article 23(1)(j) GDPR allows limitations to protect the individual interests of a (potential) litigant, Article 23(1)(f) GDPR allows limitations to protect the court proceedings themselves as well as the applicable procedural rules.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 10/2020 on restrictions under Article 23 GDPR\u2019, 13 October 2021 (Version 2.0), margin number margin number 35. Any legislative measure adopted on the basis of Article 23(1) GDPR must contain, where relevant , specific provisions about the criteria listed in Article 23(2)(a) to (h) GDPR. [ 35 ] The phrase \u201c where relevant \u201d is linked to the circumstances. Hence, the legislator needs to justify why it is not relevant to include such provisions in the legislative measure. The EDPB highlights the importance of Recital 8 GDPR in this regard: the reason for the restriction, how and when it applies, should be comprehensible to persons to whom it applies. [ 36 ] \"As a rule, all the requirements detailed below should be included in the legislative measure imposing restrictions under Article 23 GDPR. Exceptions to this rule, based on the fact that one or more provisions in Article 23(2) GDPR are not relevant regarding the legislative measure foreseeing the restriction of data subjects\u2019 rights, need to be duly justified by the legislator. \" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 10/2020 on restrictions under Article 23 GDPR\u2019, 13 October 2021 (Version 2.0), margin number 47 et seq. The legislative measure should clearly explain the purposes or categories of the processing (Article 23(2)(a) GDPR) to explain the objective of the restriction. \"For example, national legislation on prevention and investigation of breaches of ethics for regulated professions might state that if the disclosure of the fact that a person is under investigation for a serious breach may be prejudicial to the purpose of the investigation, the information may not be disclosed to the data subject for a limited time. The possible purposes of the processing need to be linked to the grounds for the restrictions\nmentioned in point 3.3 of these guidelines. It should be said that sometimes the exercise of data subjects\u2019 rights helps the controllers performing their function. For example, the right to rectification can contribute to the quality of the data.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 10/2020 on restrictions under Article 23 GDPR\u2019, 13 October 2021 (Version 2.0), margin number 50 et seqq. Article 23(2)(b) GDPR states that the categories of personal data should also be indicated in the legislative measure providing for a restriction under Article 23 GDPR. \"[R]estrictions concerning special categories of personal data may have a bigger impact on the data subjects and, therefore, the legislative measure setting such a restriction should mention the concerned special categories of data therein.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 10/2020 on restrictions under Article 23 GDPR\u2019, 13 October 2021 (Version 2.0), margin number 54. The EDPB notes that, where possible, the controller can go further and list the specific data items to which the restriction of rights may apply, such as the preliminary results of an investigation, a decision opening an inquiry, etc. [ 37 ] Any legislative restriction under Article 23 GDPR should, in accordance with Article 23(2)(c) GDPR, specify which rights or obligations are limited, and to which extent, i.e. how far those rights are limited. [ 38 ] Article 23(2)(d) GDPR adds information about the safeguards to prevent abuse or unlawful access or transfer to the list of of Article 23(2) GDPR. This provision refers particularly to technical or organisational measures necessary to avoid breaches or unlawful transfers such as the storage in a safe way of physical documents. The measure could, for example, contain the obligation for periodic measures to review the restriction. [ 39 ] The requirement to specify the controller, or categories of controllers (Article 23(2)(e) GDPR), besides giving the data subjects a higher degree of legal certainty, also provides them with information regarding whom to address in order to exercise their rights once the restriction is over. [ 40 ] According to Article 32(2)(f) GDPR, any legislative measure under Article 23 should include information as to the storage periods and the applicable safeguards taking into account the nature, scope and purposes of the processing or categories of processing. \"For instance, the retention period could be calculated as the duration of the processing operation plus additional time for potential litigation.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 10/2020 on restrictions under Article 23 GDPR\u2019, 13 October 2021 (Version 2.0), margin number 59. Also, the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects is listed as something that should be elaborated on in the legislative measure in accordance with Article (23(2)(g) GDPR). These risks should be previously assessed in the necessity and proportionality test (see above). If processing is likely to result in a high risk for the purposes of the GDPR, a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) should be conducted. [ 41 ] \"The legislator should assess the risks to data subject\u2019s rights and freedoms from the perspective of the data subjects. It is not always mandatory to perform a DPIA, but concrete risks to data subjects - such as erroneous profiling leading to discrimination, reduced human dignity, freedom of speech, the right to privacy and data protection, a bigger impact on vulnerable groups (such as children or persons with disability), to mention a few - may be stated in the legislative measure, if applicable.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 10/2020 on restrictions under Article 23 GDPR\u2019, 13 October 2021 (Version 2.0), margin number 62. Lastly, the legislator should always include the assessment of these risks in recitals or explanatory memoranda of the legislation, or in the DPIA itself. [ 42 ] The last requirement, \u201c the right to be informed about the restriction, unless prejudicial to the purpose of the restriction \u201d (Article 23(2)(h) GDPR), could be fulfilled via a general data protection notice. As a general rule, data subjects should be informed about restrictions to exercise their rights. However,\u00a0 for example, during the (very) preliminary stages of an investigation, notifying the data subject of\u00a0 a restriction to exercise their rights, could hamper the investigation. Therefore, in such exceptional circumstances, this requirement can be set aside. However, in cases like these, once the\u00a0notification of\u00a0this restriction\u00a0would no longer hamper the investigation, the data subject should then be informed. [ 43 ] Pursuant to Article 36(4) GDPR , the DPA shall be consulted before a legislative measure under Article 23 GDPR is adopted. Moreover, Article 57(1)(c) GDPR requires the DPA to give its advice on legislative measures regarding the protection of data subjects\u2019 rights and freedoms. It follows from Article 58(3)(b) GDPR , that, if the DPA is not consulted, they can issue an opinion on any data-protection related issue. They can do this on their own initiative, to different Member State institutions, like the national parliament, government or other institutions, as well as to the public. [ 44 ] The EDPB stipulates that the European Commission, as Guardian of the Treaties, must monitor the application of EU primary and secondary law, and\u00a0ensure uniform application throughout the EU. Moreover, it follows from the principle of supremacy of EU law (also see Case C-378/17) [ 45 ] that all state organs should not apply national legislation that is contrary to EU law. Hence, any legislative measure pursuant to Article 23 GDPR that does not meet the requirements of the provision, cannot be applied. [ 46 ] The EDPB highlighted a few elements for controllers and processors. First, although it is not listed in Article 30 GDPR , in light of the accountability principle ( Article 5(2) GDPR ) it is good practice that the controller keeps record of the application of restrictions on concrete cases. This record should list the reason, the ground(s), and the timing of the restriction, as well as the outcome of the necessity- and proportionality test, so that this can be made available to the DPA upon request. In any case, if the controller has a DPO, this person should be involved in the restriction process, so that they can assess the restriction as well. Second, data subjects should be informed of the restrictions, at the latest when they do no longer apply. After the lifting of the restriction, the data subject can exercise all their rights. Third, if a controller infringes a legislative measure that imposes restrictions, the DPA can use their advisory, investigative, and corrective powers pursuant to Article 58 GDPR .

Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with this Regulation. Those measures shall be reviewed and updated where necessary. 2.   Where proportionate in relation to processing activities, the measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall include the implementation of appropriate data protection policies by the controller. 3.   Adherence to approved codes of conduct as referred to in Article 40 or approved certification mechanisms as referred to in Article 42 may be used as an element by which to demonstrate compliance with the obligations of the controller. This provision opens Section 1 of Chapter IV, which is dedicated to the \u201c General obligations \u201d of the controller and processor. Article 24 stipulates the abstract obligation of the controller to ensure and demonstrate GDPR compliance and expands the accountability principle set out in Article 5(2) GDPR - together they are the core provisions to implement the \" accountability \" principle on an abstract level. Article 24 is therefore closely connected to the more specific obligations of the controller, such as Article 25 GDPR or Article 32 GDPR . [ 1 ] This article assigns a proactive role to the controller, who has to ensure compliance with the GDPR at all stages of processing. [ 2 ] To achieve this goal, the controller uses technical and organisational measures that are appropriate to the risk connected to the processing. Article 24 is therefor an article that foresees certain flexibility via a \"risk based approach\". [ 3 ] The controller is not only responsible for actual compliance with the GDPR; it must also be able to demonstrate compliance. The specific way to demonstrate compliance is left to the controller. The Article mentions that the controller can use codes of conduct or approved certification mechanisms as an element of such demonstration. Given that Article 24 GDPR is an introductory Article between the general obligations in Article 5(2) GDPR and the more specific Articles that follow, it is the only article in the section on the general obligations which cannot be directly penalised with a fine under Article 83(4)(a) or Article 83(5) GDPR . [ 4 ] EDPB and WP29 Guidelines: EDPB, 'Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR', 7 July 2021 (Version 2.1) (available here ), WP29, 'Opinion 3/2010 on the principle of accountability', 00062/10/EN WP173, 13 July 2010 (available here ), WP29, 'Guidelines on Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and determining whether processing is \u201clikely to result in a high risk\u201d for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679' 17/EN WP248 rev.01, 4 April 2017 (available here ). This provision obliges the controller to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure compliance of its processing activities with the GDPR. Therefore, this provision addresses the controller ( Article 4(7) GDPR ) as the primary addressee for GDPR compliance. \"Article 5(2) and Article 24 of the GDPR impose general accountability and compliance requirements upon the controller of personal data. They require that controller to take appropriate steps to prevent any infringements of the rules laid down in the GDPR in order to ensure the right to the protection of data [...]\" CJEU - C-492/23 - Russmedia , margin number 88. Other entities, such as data processors, are not subject of Article 24 and their responsibility is limited to specific aspects regulated separately. However, even a limited responsibility of a processor does not affect the overall accountability and liability of the controller. [ 5 ] Furthermore, producers of software and hardware are not subject to Article 24 or indeed the GDPR, if they are not having a role as controller or processor. This means that controllers (often entities with limited know-how in relation to software and hardware) are liable for violations of the GDPR that are triggered by non-compliant software and hardware. The GDPR requires controllers to check their supply chain. This is in reality hard to do, given the extreme market power of some suppliers and the imbalance of know-how. However, provision of products and services that cannot be legally used in the Union may trigger contractual claims against such suppliers. For example: A small and medium enterprise (\"SME\") uses a standard software by a dominant software provider. The software unlawfully processes personal data of the SME's employees. Being the controller, the SME is typically liable under the GDPR. However, it may have a civil law claim against the software provider, if the product does not comply with EU law. The term \" measure \" must be understood broadly since it refers to all actions that are appropriate to make the processing compliant with the GDPR. As the provision explains, this can be done through technical and organisational means. \"Technical measures\" have a direct effect on the operation of technical processing and regularly deal with hard- and software components, while \"organisational measures\" have an effect on the circumstances of processing and often refer to processes and people connected to the processing activity. [ 6 ] In practice, the distinction between technical and organisational measures is not always clear as these can overlap. However, this is unproblematic because the GDPR does not differentiate between the two in terms of legal requirements. [ 7 ] The GDPR does not determine specific measures, given that each processing operation can entail different risks for the rights of freedoms of data subjects. It is upon the controller to identify these risks and take appropriate measures. For example: A controller wants to enable its employees to work from home. In order to ensure GDPR compliance in relation to the security requirements in Article 32 GDPR , he implements a number of technical and organisational measures, like providing a VPN connection to the company network (technical measure) and drafting a \u201cwork from home\u201d policy which makes the use of the VPN connection mandatory and computers are properly protected from third-party access, including through loss of hardware or access by family members (organisational measure). Examples of a technical measure that are regularly mentioned are pseudonymisation of personal data, encryption, access restrictions and password protection. The implementation of data protection policies, a yearly review of the processing activities and training of employees and management would be organisational measures. Many requirements in other Articles of the GDPR (for example the principles in Article 5 GDPR ) overlap with duties under Article 24(1) GDPR and require technical and organisational measures independent of Article 24 GDPR. For example: For example the principle of \"data minimisation\" or \"storage limitation\" is usually implemented via a deletion routine (a technical or organisational measure) that limits the risks for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in case of a data breach, because only limited data will be leaked. Certain other provisions of the GPDR demand the implementation of more specific technical and organisational measures (e.g. Article 25 (1) and (2) , Article 28(1) , Article 32(1) GDPR , Article 89(1) GDPR ). These measures can also be regarded as measures under Article 24(1) since they serve the compliance with the obligations under the GDPR. However, the controller has to assess in these cases if additional measures are necessary given that these Articles apply in parallel with Article 24 GDPR. Pursuant to Article 24(1) the controller must be able to demonstrate the compliance with the GDPR. This provision therefore widens the accountability obligation stipulated in Article 5(2) GDPR which obliges the controller to be able to demonstrate compliance with the data protection principles set out in Article 5(1) GDPR . [ 8 ] The ability to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR must be ensured by the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures. The comprehensiveness of the necessary evidence must be proportionate to the risk for the rights of data subjects posed by the processing operation. The riskier or the more complex a processing operation, the more comprehensive the accompanying evidence must be. [ 9 ] The GDPR does not list these measures. The controller can use a wide variety of ways in order to demonstrate that it implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures that ensure compliance with the GDPR. These can be based on policies, electronic records, protocols, statistics or technical implementations that can be later reviewed to demonstrate compliance. The measure has to be appropriate (see below), considering the risk. For example: It is not sufficient that a controller manages to answer to access requests in accordance with Article 12 GDPR and Article 15 GDPR . A controller that is subject to many subject access requests may also be asked by an authority to demonstrate that it implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures that ensure full compliance with the data subject's right to access. The GDPR mentions that, a controller can refer to approved codes of conduct or certification mechanisms (see Article 24(3)). Recitals 77 additionally mentions EDPB guidelines and indications provided by the data protection officer. Certain other provisions of the GDPR provide for specific measures to demonstrate compliance (e.g. demonstrating that a data subject has consented under Article 7(1) GDPR , maintaining a record of processing activities under Article 30(1) GDPR, documenting personal data breaches under Article 33(5) GDPR or performing a data protection impact assessment under Article 35 GDPR ). [ 10 ] The duty to demonstrate compliance is not limited to demonstrations to the supervisory authority. The duty, for example, also applies to complaint procedures in accordance with Article 77 and 78 GDPR or civil litigation under Article 79 GDPR . Whether the controller\u2019s obligation to demonstrate compliance also implies a reversal of the burden of proof when a data subject seeks compensation for damages pursuant to Article 82 GDPR , is disputed, [ 11 ] given the more specific rules in Article 82(3) GDPR. Risks and possibilities to combat them are constancy evolving. The controller must continuously ensure and demonstrate compliance with the GDPR by consistently reviewing existing measures and updating them. Beyond the qualifier \" where necessary \", it is not specified how frequently updates must be carried out. The criterion of necessity does not mean that the controller must only react to concrete changes. Since it is the controller\u2019s responsibility to ensure that their processing operations are compliant at any time, the controller has to review its measures regularly. However, significant changes in the processing activity or the legal environment will certainly trigger the obligation to review the technical and organisational measures. [ 12 ] For example: A controller running an online-shop receives a complaint from a data subject claiming that one of his online-forms violates the principle of data minimization ( Article 5(1)(c) GDPR ). Such a complaint could trigger a review of the processing activity. Equally, the news that a new trend in phishing emails is emerging may require new proactive technical and organisational measures to be implemented to ensure that customers or employees will not fall for such an approach. In course of the review the controller must assess if the current technical and organisational measures, are still appropriate and effective to ensure the compliance with the GDPR and to enable the controller to demonstrate the compliance. If not, the controller has to implement additional technical and organisational measures or change the existing ones in order to bring the processing activity in compliance with the GDPR. [ 13 ] Typically yearly routines, warnings of security experts, by public authorities or an internal data protection officer in accordance with Article 39(1) GDPR , could be additional triggers to revisit existing measures. To decide which specific technical and organisational measures to implement, the controller must perform a comprehensive assessment of processing activities and analyse potential consequences and causes of harm in order to effectively evaluate and mitigate risks for the rights and freedoms of natural persons associated with the data processing. Given that the test is a multi-factor test along the idea of a risk based approach , the controller must apply a very high-level abstract test to a concrete situation. This is not always easy or straight forward. Common mistake: Many people claim that the GDPR would have a general \"risk based approach\" throughout the law. This is not correct. In fact you can find different approaches in different Articles of the GDPR: (1) Most Articles are absolute \"yes or no\" rules, like the requirements for consent in Article 4(11) GDPR or the fact that upon request access to personal data must be provided under Article 15 GDPR .\n(2) Some Articles have a \"hard coded\" risk based approach. For example, any special category data under Article 9 GDPR is considered high risk by law and hence falls under special protections. Anonymised data on the other hand is by definition not regulated by the GDPR.\n(3) In some Articles, like Article 24, Article 25 or Article 32 GDPR the controller gets to apply a more flexible \"risk based approach\" based on an open multi-factor test. This allows more flexibility in areas where the legislator cannot realistically codify a rule for each situation. However, this also puts more responsibility on the controller. The controller must consider the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing. [ 14 ] The nature of the processing refers in particular to the type or processing (e.g. collection, recording, storing, etc.) as well as to the categories of data processed (e.g. whether special categories of personal data are processed). [ 15 ] The scope of the processing refers to the quantity of the data processing resulting from the amount of affected data subjects, the amount of processed data, the duration and the geographical extend of the data processing. [ 16 ] The context of the processing refers to the specific circumstances such as the modalities and technical implementation, the type and method of data collection and the legal basis in accordance with Article 6 GDPR. [ 17 ] The controller also has to consider the purposes of the processing, for example financial data may be more at risk or data concerning the psychological health of a person may have a larger impact on individuals' rights if leaked. See the commentary on Article 5(1)(b) GDPR for more details on the purpose of a processing activity. According to Recital 76 the likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject should be determined by reference to the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing. It also states that the risk should be evaluated on the basis of an objective assessment . The controller must identify the risks associated with the respective processing activity and assess the severity of those risks for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, as well as the likelihood that these materialise. The likelihood is the statistical probability that a certain risk will materialise in the future. It should be noted that some risks are inherent to processing activities \u2013 the likelihood is therefore 100\u00a0%. [ 18 ] The severity of the risk is determined by the extent a potential damage would have to the rights and freedoms of a natural person as well as the nature of the damage. [ 19 ] Recital 75 clarifies that the damage can be physical, material, or immaterial and lists a range of examples of damages, such as discrimination, identity theft, fraud and loss of confidentiality or control. Recital 83 GDPR similarly suggests that not all risks are equally relevant; rather, the potential physical, material or non-material damage connected to the risk should be considered. Article 24 does not prescribe procedural steps on how to perform this assessment. Therefore, it is left to the controller to use a suitable method. However, regarding the methodology, reference can be made to the risk assessment in the course of a data protection impact assessment in accordance with Article 35 GDPR , [ 20 ] which a controller has to carry out if a processing activity is likely to result in a high risk for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. The controller has to implement technical and organisational measures that are appropriate for the respective processing activity and effective . [ 21 ] Therefore, the controller does not have to implement every available technical and organisational measure but has to consider \u2013 taking into account the specific processing activity and the underlying risks \u2013 which measures are necessary in order to ensure compliance with the GPDR and enable the controller to demonstrate such compliance. This assessment of proportionality follows from Article 52(1) CFR and has to be conducted by the controller itself. It should be noted that the GDPR imposes the duty to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures and to perform a respective risk assessment in a number of its provisions (e.g. in Articles 24, 25 , 32 and 35 ). The legislators have usually used different wording and elements in each of these assessments. While some elements in a specific Article have a logical link to the provision, some other elements seem to be a result of uncoordinated drafting in the legislative process. It depends on each situation if elements can be taking into account when interpreting other Articles or not. In practice, controllers usually perform a risk assessment for each processing activity taking into account all the requirements set out in the different provisions of the GDPR and implements then appropriate technical and organisational measures that best comply with all those provision. Article 24(2) mentions a specific organisational measure, namely the implementation of data protection policies . The term is not defined, but seems to mean internal guidelines with binding effect in the controller\u2019s organisation. Such policies regularly include concrete procedural instructions and oblige the controller\u2019s employees to act in a specific way to ensure compliance with the GDPR. [ 22 ] If the controller appointed a data protection officer, this person is also tasked with the monitoring of the controller\u2019s data protection policies (see Article 39(1)(b) GDPR ). For example: Most controllers have a general data protection policy covering topics like the destruction of sensitive documents, the usage of IT-infrastructure and deletion periods as well as more specific data protection policies like specific internal rules regarding the compliance with data protection in the product development process or the handling of access requests in accordance with Article 15 GDPR. The implementation of data protection policies is only mandatory (\" shall \"), when it is proportionate to the processing activity. In other words, it is not obligatory to implement a data protection policy for all processing activities. However, for larger organisations or controllers of extensive processing activities the implementation of data protection policies is usually necessary. [ 23 ] Regardless of the existence of an obligation, an implementation of data protection policies is an important tool in order to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR. Article 24(3) provides for the possibility to refer to the adherence to (i) approved codes of conduct ( Article 40 GDPR ), (ii) approved certification mechanisms ( Article 42 GDPR ) in order to indicate compliance with the GDPR. Nevertheless, it follows from the word \" element \" that such self-regulation measures support the assumption that the controller is compliant, but do not prove it. [ 24 ] In practice, Article 40 GDPR is not common or even just available in many industry sectors. For example: A credit information agency adheres to approved codes of conduct when implementing deletion periods for certain data categories could still violate Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6(1) GDPR because the duration of those deletion periods are unjustified. [ 25 ] This provision does not limit the possibility to demonstrate compliance via other means (see section on \u201cAnd to demonstrate GDPR compliance\u201d above). \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 24 GDPR \u2191 Hartung , in K\u00fchling, Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 24, margin number 11 (C.H.

(3) Approved certification mechanism 4 Decisions 5 References 1.   Taking into account the state of the art, the cost of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for rights and freedoms of natural persons posed by the processing, the controller shall, both at the time of the determination of the means for processing and at the time of the processing itself, implement appropriate technical and organisational measures, such as pseudonymisation, which are designed to implement data-protection principles, such as data minimisation, in an effective manner and to integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing in order to meet the requirements of this Regulation and protect the rights of data subjects. 2.   The controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures for ensuring that, by default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed. That obligation applies to the amount of personal data collected, the extent of their processing, the period of their storage and their accessibility. In particular, such measures shall ensure that by default personal data are not made accessible without the individual's intervention to an indefinite number of natural persons. 3.   An approved certification mechanism pursuant to Article 42 may be used as an element to demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article. Article 25 GDPR establishes the idea of data protection \"by design and by default \u201d. [ 1 ] Accordingly, controllers must put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures that are designed to implement data protection principles. This means that when programming, designing and conceptualizing systems and programs, as well as when acquiring systems and services from third parties, the controller has to ensure that data protection is taken into account and that the principles of the GDPR are properly integrated into the processing activity. [ 2 ] The first paragraph describes the principles of data protection by design in more detail. The second paragraph expands on this by describing the principles of data protection by default . The third paragraph explains that an approved certification mechanism, pursuant to Article 42, may be used as an element to demonstrate compliance. [ 3 ] The obligations under Article 25 are directed specifically at the controller ( Article 4(7) GDPR ) which remains accountable for fulfilling all legal obligations related to data processing. Processors are indirectly affected since, under Article 28(1) GDPR , a controller shall only use processors providing the same standards as foreseen under Article 25 GDPR. [ 4 ] However, ultimately the controller is responsible for the compliance of the processing carried out by their processors and sub-processors. [ 5 ] Manufacturers or producers of systems are not directly addressed by the GDPR. Nevertheless, as suggested by Recital 78, they are influenced by data protection laws, either indirectly or due to market dynamics. This encourages manufacturers and service providers to offer and introduce products, systems, and services that prioritize data protection. [ 6 ] EDPB Guidelines: EDPB, 'Guidelines 4/2019 on Article 25 Data Protection by Design and by Default' 20 October 2020 (Version 2.0) (available here ). The controller must implement technical and organisational measures that are capable of effectively realizing the data protection principles set out in Article 5 GDPR , meeting the requirements of the GDPR and ensuring the protection of the data subject's rights (including Articles 12 - 22 GDPR). This should already happen when the controller determines the means of the processing , i.e. in the design process . This ensures that appropriate technical and organisational measures are implemented at the beginning of the processing and throughout the processing itself. These obligations must be addressed with practical and effective solutions. [ 7 ] Therefore, the controller should implement measures that systematically guarantee that all current and future processing activities include appropriate technical and organisational measures. [ 8 ] Article 25 (1) lists elements that the controller has to take into account when determining the technical and organisational measures of a specific processing operation. In general, this means, that the controller has to be aware of and take into account the latest developments in its field and has to stay up-to-date with technology. The idea is that a controller shall never go below what is commonly considered the appropriate technological standard at a given time. In detail, the interpretation of this criterion can be challenging, requiring appropriate technical expertise and input from experts. Guidelines by supervisory authorities can also be helpful to interpret the current state of the art. [ 9 ] But since the state of the art is a dynamic concept which has to be assessed continuously and in the context of the technological progress, even existing standards or guidelines can only be indicative for the assessment whether respective measures of the controller still suffice. [ 10 ] \"[T]he reference to \u201cstate of the art\u201d imposes an obligation on controllers, when determining the appropriate technical and organisational measures, to take account of the current progress in technology that is available in the market. The requirement is for controllers to have knowledge of, and stay up to date on technological advances; how technology can present data protection risks or opportunities to the processing operation; and how to implement and update the measures and safeguards that secure effective implementation of the principles and rights of data subjects taking into account the evolving technological landscape.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 4/2019 on Article 25 Data Protection by Design and by Default\u2019, 20 October 2020 (Version 2.0), margin number 19. The \"state of the art\" criterion does not exclusively apply to technical measures. Also the organisational measures like data protection and IT-security trainings or policies of the controller have to reflect any developments in the state of the art. [ 11 ] It is therefore not compliant to simply keep the same technical and organisational measures over a longer period of time without adopting them to the developments in the state of the art. [ 12 ] Regularly the controller has a choice between different technical and organisational measures. When deciding which technical and organisational measures to implement, the controller can take the cost of implementation of those measures into account and is not forced to allocate an excessive amount of resources for one specific measure if there are alternative measures available that are less resource-intensive yet still effective. Such costs include not only costs necessary to develop privacy compliant technologies, but more broadly all business resources allocated to achieve data protection goals (e.g. efforts by individual employees). [ 13 ] When calculating these costs, all necessary expenses related to the implementation of the measures should be considered, including acquisition and installation costs prior to processing initiation, as well as operational and maintenance costs during the ongoing processing. An economic analysis should be conducted to assess the relationship between costs and risks. The higher the level of risk associated with the data processing, the more economically justifiable it is for the controller to invest in implementing the necessary technical measures. Cost-intensive measures that offer minimal additional risk reduction may not be required. [ 14 ] However, it is important to stress that the implementation cost should be taken into consideration when incorporating data protection by design, rather than being used as a justification for not implementing it. Whatever measures the controller implements, they have to be effective and ensure that all the requirements of the GDPR are met and the rights of data subjects are protected. [ 15 ] \"The cost element does not require the controller to spend a disproportionate amount of resources when alternative, less resource demanding, yet effective measures exist. [...] [T]he chosen measures shall ensure that the processing activity foreseen by the controller does not process personal data in violation of the principles, independent of cost. Controllers should be able to manage the overall costs to be able to effectively implement all of the principles and, consequentially, protect the rights. EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 4/2019 on Article 25 Data Protection by Design and by Default\u2019, 20 October 2020 (Version 2.0), margin number 24 et seq. These criteria have the same meaning as in Article 24(1) and Article 32(1) . See therefore the commentary on Article 24 GDPR . The GDPR imposes the duty to perform a risk assessment in a number of its provisions like in Articles 24 , 25, 32 and 35 . The risk assessment should always be performed with regard to a given processing activity and is usually performed in connection with all the GDPR provisions demanding a risk assessment. Since the state of the art as well as the specific conditions of a processing activity regularly change, the risk assessment should be performed in regular intervals and when it comes to changes in the processing activity. For detailed remarks see therefore commentary on Article 24 GDPR . For example: The provider of a newspaper offers high quality news articles against payment. The provider plans to give visitors of its website the alternative option to \"pay\" for the article by consenting to the processing of their personal data for behavioural advertising. According to the risk assessment foreseen in Article 25(1) GDPR the controller takes into account the particular risks associated with a lack of freely given consent, which constitutes a violation of the lawfulness principle and ends up implementing an additional free version without behavioural advertising [ 16 ] in order to provide an adequate alternative to the consent option. [ 17 ] Controllers must assess the implementation of appropriate measures \" at the time of the determination of the means for processing \" and \" at the time of the processing itself \". Therefore, the controller must already consider this obligation in the design stage of the processing activity - i.e. when it considers how the processing will be conducted and which mechanisms and tools it will use for the processing. [ 18 ] Hence, the privacy by design principle should be considered as early as possible in order to select appropriate processing mechanisms (e.g. software, hardware, processors). This also reduces the controller's risk of having to change these basic components late in the design stage due to to a lack of compliance with data protection principles. [ 19 ] For example: A bank wants to implement a whistleblower tool for its employees. According to the privacy by design principle set out in Article 25(1) GDPR, the bank, as a controller, has to consider the requirements of the GDPR already during the design stage of the processing activity. Therefore, it has to consider how it can ensure compliance with data protection principles and protect the rights of data subjects (e.g. by choosing a GDPR compliant software by a third party and defining the strictly necessary information collected by whistleblower). \"Article 25(1) of the GDPR requires that the controller must, both at the time of the determination of the means for processing and at the time of the processing itself, implement appropriate technical and organisational measures that are designed to implement data-protection principles in an effective manner and to integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing in order to meet the requirements of that regulation and protect the rights of data subjects. [I]nasmuch as the operator of an online marketplace, such as the marketplace at issue in the main proceedings, knows or ought to know that, generally, advertisements containing sensitive data in terms of Article 9(1) of the GDPR, are liable to be published by user advertisers on its online marketplace, that operator, as controller in respect of that processing, is obliged, as soon as its service is designed, to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in order to identify such advertisements before their publication and thus to be in a position to verify whether the sensitive data that they contain are published in compliance with the principles set out in Chapter II of that regulation. Indeed, as is apparent in particular from Article 25(1) of that regulation, the obligation to implement such measures is incumbent on it not only at the time of the processing, but already at the time of the determination of the means of processing and, therefore, even before sensitive data are published on its online marketplace in breach of those principles, that obligation being specifically intended to prevent such breaches.\" CJEU - C-492/23 - Russmedia , margin number 89 and 97. Obviously the obligations also apply throughout the live circle of the processing activity. Therefore, the controller must also consider the privacy by design principle when it considers any later changes in the processing activity. This can lead to problems for processing activities that were already in place before the GDPR entered into force and that cannot easily be changed. However, Article 25 GDPR also applies to such preexisting systems. Controllers must re-asses their means of processing if the systems they use are outdated and fail to ensure compliance with the GDPR. [ 20 ] Because the state of the art continuously changes, updating systems will be a continuous and necessary practical component of adhering to the privacy by design principle during ongoing processing activities. [ 21 ] The \"technical and organisational measures\" mentioned in this provision are in principle the same measures mentioned in other provisions of the GDPR like Articles 24 and 32 . Only the concrete aim of the measures is specified somewhat differently in the various provisions. Article 25 GDPR specifically mentions pseudonymisation ( Article\u00a04(5) GDPR ) as a technical and organisational measure. It notes that such measures should be designed (i)\u00a0to implement data-protection principles, such as (but not limited to) data minimisation ( Article\u00a05(1)(c) GDPR ), in an effective manner and (ii)\u00a0to integrate the integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing in order to meet the requirements of the GDPR and protect the rights of data subjects. For detailed remarks on \"technical and organisational measures\", see the commentary on Article 24 GDPR . \"Appropriate\" is a technical or organisational measure that effectively addresses the issues posed by the specific processing and circumstances. \"Being appropriate means that the measures and necessary safeguards should be suited to achieve the intended purpose, i.e. they must implement the data protection principles effectively. The requirement to appropriateness is thus closely related to the requirement of effectiveness.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 4/2019 on Article 25 Data Protection by Design and by Default\u2019, 20 October 2020 (Version 2.0), margin number 8, footnotes omitted. In general, the \"appropriateness\" of measures chosen by the controller is a point upon which several GDPR provisions touch, most notably - alongside Article 25 - Articles 24 and 32 . The EDPS Guidelines on assessing the proportionality of measures that limit the fundamental rights to privacy and to the protection of personal data [ 22 ] can be used as a starting point to gain some insight. Article 25(1) GDPR mentions pseudonymisation as an example of an appropriate  technical and organisational measure. The EDPB Guidelines list other potential suitable measures - always depending on the context and the associated risks: storing personal data available in a structured, commonly machine-readable format; enabling data subjects to intervene in the processing; providing information about the storage of personal data; having malware detection systems; training employees about basic \"cyber hygiene\"; establishing privacy and information security management systems; and obligating processors contractually to implement specific data minimisation practices. [ 23 ] Specifically important for the timely consideration of data protection principles is in the design stage of a processing activity is the implementation of internal policies obliging the controller's employees to take the requirements of the GDPR into account when they start to determine the means for the processing. [ 24 ] For example: A financial institution requires its product development team to complete a \"privacy by design information sheet\" during the design phase of new products. The team has to collect specific information regarding the processing in the document and already clarify how the data protection principles and data subject's rights are secured. Furthermore, in line with the accountability principle stated in Article 5(2) GDPR , the controller should adopt additional measures to demonstrate the effectiveness of their choices. [ 25 ] The technical and organisational measures implemented by the controller must be designed to implement data-protection principles in an effective manner. The provision explicitly mentions data minimization ( Article\u00a05(1)(c) GDPR ) as such a principle but the provision is applicable to all principles listed in Article\u00a05(1) GDPR . [ 26 ] While this provision does not require the implementation of any specific technical and organisational measure the controller is obliged to find measures that effectively protect and ensure the compliance with the data protection principles. In order to decide if a specific measure is effective (and therefore appropriate) in implementing data protection principles the controller has to consider the context of the specific processing. [ 27 ] In order to fulfil this obligation effectively the controller has to implement measures to systematically ensure that all current and future processing activities include appropriate technical and organisational measures. [ 8 ] For example: In order to fulfil its obligation under Article\u00a025(1) GDPR, a controller implements a privacy by design process for every new processing activity and audits existing processing activities each year. The technical and organisational measures implemented by the controller must additionally be designed to integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing in order to meet the requirements of the GDPR and protect the rights of data subjects. From the term \"safeguards\", it cannot be derived that any specific technical and organisational measures have to be integrated. Rather, the terms \"safeguards\" and \"technical and organisational measures\" are interchangeable. [ 28 ] The controller's obligation to implement the necessary safeguards into the processing in order to meet the requirements of the GDPR can be understood as a responsibility to adopt internal policies and measures which ensure that the GDPR's obligations are taken into account whenever any new processing activity is planned or an existing processing activity is subject to any change. [ 29 ] Specifically, the controller has to integrate safeguards ensuring the protection of the rights of the data subjects. Therefore, the controller should not passively react to requests by data subjects, but should already have considered data subjects' rights and anticipate requests by data subjects in accordance with Chapter III of the GDPR. [ 30 ] For example: A data broker collects personal data from a vast amount of data. It has to implement technical and organisational measures that ensure that e.g. (i)\u00a0information is provided to the data subjects in accordance with Article 13 GDPR and Article 14 GDPR and (ii) even a vast amount of access requests can be efficiently answered without undue delay in accordance with Article 12 GDPR and Article 15 GDPR . Article 25(2) GDPR requires the controller to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that, by default, only personal data necessary for the specific processing purpose are processed. This provision establishes an explicit connection with the principles of data minimization, storage limitation and purpose limitation. \"[T]he term \u201cby default\u201d when processing personal data, refers to making choices regarding configuration values or processing options that are set or prescribed in a processing system, such as a software application, service or device, or a manual processing procedure that affect the amount of personal data collected, the extent of their processing, the period of their storage and their accessibility.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 4/2019 on Article 25 Data Protection by Design and by Default\u2019, 20 October 2020 (Version 2.0), margin number 41. One could argue that this clarification is redundant since the controller is already obliged, under paragraph 1, to adopt appropriate measures to ensure the effective adherence to the data protection principles, including data minimisation ( Article\u00a05(1)(c) GDPR ). However, although the principles of data protection by design and by default may look similar at first glance, there are considerable differences between them. First, \"by design\" is broader than \"by default\", since the focus of the latter is adherence with the principles of data minimisation, storage, purpose limitation and confidentiality. Whereas the \"by design\" principle focuses more on the development stages of the processing activity, \"by default\" is more about the end-result: i.e. ensuring the settings are configured in such a way that data minimisation and confidentiality are ensured. [ 31 ] Second, the underlying concept of the principle of data protection by default is that the controller implements measures to ensure that each processing activity is configured in a way that per default the available settings ensure that the processing of personal data does not exceed what is necessary for the specific purpose of the processing. [ 32 ] In other words, unless the user decides otherwise, the default settings shall be the most privacy-friendly. This is particularly significant, considering the prevailing tendency to accumulate personal data beyond reasonable necessity, especially in the realm of the Internet and mobile applications. [ 33 ] For example: A company that produces an operating system for a computer has, inter alia, to consider that a customer might want to change their settings in such a way that they can amend their data protection settings themselves, as follows from Article 25(1) GDPR. However, when this computer is delivered to the customer, the default settings within the software must already be set in such a way that the data protection principles of data minimisation and confidentiality are already ensured, since this follows from Article 25(2) GDPR. The addressee of the provision is the controller. See the commentary under paragraph 1 for more details on this point and the commentary on Article\u00a04(7) GDPR for more information on the definition of the controller. Even though the provision is particularly relevant for the standard settings of software products it should be noted that the manufacturer is not an addressee of the provision. [ 34 ] To ensure the highest \"default\" data protection standard, the controller must implement appropriate technical and organisational measures. With regard to the meaning of \"appropriate\" and \"technical and organisational measures\" please see to the analysis in paragraph (1) and the commentary on Article\u00a024 GDPR . In the context of this paragraph, the measures must implement default settings for each processing activity that ensure that only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose are processed. Therefore, just as it is the case for compliance with the privacy by design principle, the implementation of internal policies can be a suitable measure to ensure that for each processing activity, by default, only necessary personal data are processed. For example: A controller puts a privacy by default policy in place that obliges its employees to specify (i) the specific purpose of the processing activity as well as (ii)\u00a0the necessary amount of personal data that is needed for the purpose, (iii)\u00a0the necessary extent of the processing of that data, (iv)\u00a0the necessary period for which the data has to be stored and (v)\u00a0who needs access to that data. Although measures should be implemented to ensure compliance with every data protection principle (see paragraph 1), the measures in the context of Article 25(2) must be capable to specifically ensure the principles of data minimisation, storage limitation, purpose limitation and confidentiality. [ 35 ] In contrast to the privacy by design principle, the privacy by default provision of Article\u00a025(2) GDPR does not provide for a proportionality assessment taking into account the the cost of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing and the risks posed by the processing for the data subjects. The measures implemented by the controller must therefore ensure privacy-friendly default settings irrespective of these factors. [ 36 ] The word \" default \" comes from computer science. It refers to the pre-existing or pre-selected value of a configurable setting. The principle of data protection by default means that a product or service should have the most data protection-friendly settings configured when the product or service is first turned on or used. [ 37 ] Hence, the \"factory presets\", in case of electronic products, should ensure that the processing is limited to what is strictly necessary in order to achieve the (lawful) purpose of the processing activity. [ 38 ] \"The controller should choose and be accountable for implementing default processing settings and options in a way that only processing that is strictly necessary to achieve the set, lawful purpose is carried out by default. [...] This means that by default, the controller shall not collect more data than is necessary, they shall not process the data collected more than is necessary for their purposes, nor shall they store the data for longer than necessary. The basic requirement is that data protection is built into the processing by default.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 4/2019 on Article 25 Data Protection by Design and by Default\u2019, 20 October 2020 (Version 2.0), margin number 42. In cases where the controller utilizes third-party or off-the-shelf software, it is crucial to conduct an assessment of the product. Any functions within the software that lack a legal basis or are incompatible with the intended purposes of processing must be deactivated or disabled. [ 39 ] Similar considerations extend to the organisational measures, which should be designed to initially handle only the minimum necessary amount of personal data required for the specific operations. This becomes particularly significant when granting access to data to employees with diverse roles and different access necessities. [ 40 ] It is subject of an ongoing debate whether it is compliant with this provision to force data subjects to make specific choices with regard to data protection settings (mandated choice), since this could potentially be overwhelming to data subjects. [ 41 ] Controllers should conduct a sound analysis of the volume, types, categories, and level of detail of personal data that is necessary for their processing activities. It is important to compare the risks arising from the envisaged processing with the risks that may be posed by the collection of smaller amounts or less detailed information about data subjects. Regardless of the specific circumstances, the default settings should not allow for the collection of personal data that is unnecessary for the intended processing purpose. This means that if certain categories of personal data are determined to be unnecessary or if less detailed information is sufficient instead of highly granular data, excessive data shall not be collected in the first place. [ 42 ] Processing activities involving personal data must adhere to the principle of necessity. While multiple processing operations may contribute to a specific purpose, it does not imply that all types and frequencies of processing can be conducted on the data. Controllers should exercise caution to ensure that they do not exceed the boundaries of \"compatible purposes\" as outlined in Article 6(4) and consider what processing activities would be within the reasonable expectations of data subjects. It should be noted that the fact that some data was obtained by and is available to the controller since it is necessary for a specific purpose does not not justify the unrestricted or excessive processing of that data. [ 43 ] The controller is required to restrict the retention period of personal data to what is necessary for the specific purpose of processing. Once the personal data is no longer needed for its intended purpose, it should be either deleted or anonymized by default. The duration of the retention period will vary depending on the particular processing purpose. This obligation is directly connected to the principle of storage limitation stated in Article 5(1)(e) GDPR . By default, the controller should establish systematic procedures for data deletion or anonymization that are integrated into the processing operations. [ 44 ] Article 25(2) clarifies that, by default, only the minimum number of individuals within the controller's organization (or indirectly, the processor's organization), should have access to personal data. This entails the adoption of technical and organizational measures that restrict personnel access to databases. [ 45 ] In line with this logic, the latter part of Article 25(2) further clarifies that the data subject should always be consulted before their personal data is made available to an indefinite number of individuals, or in other words, before it is made public (see next point). Article 25(2) GDPR specifies that the privacy by default principle encompasses the controller's obligation to implement technical and organisational measures that ensure that personal data are not made accessible to an indefinite number of natural persons without the individual data subject making a choice to do so (i.e. to make the data publicly available). Making personal data available to the public (e.g. on the internet) could result to unforeseeable and unintended future data processing. Therefore, the data subject should have an opportunity to make a choice about such a publication. [ 46 ] \"Making personal data available to an indefinite number of persons may result in even further dissemination of the data than initially intended. This is particularly relevant in the context of the Internet and search engines. This means that controllers should by default give data subjects an opportunity to intervene before personal data is made available on the open Internet. This is particularly important when it comes to children and vulnerable groups.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 4/2019 on Article 25 Data Protection by Design and by Default\u2019, 20 October 2020 (Version 2.0), margin number 57. This provision is specifically directed to social media providers who have the responsibility to implement privacy settings preventing the public availability of user data by default. Of course the controller can give the data subjects the option to change this setting and make their personal data publicly available. [ 47 ] Even though this provision mentions the intervention of the \"individual\" it is reasonable to understand this as a reference to the \"data subject\". [ 48 ] A controller has to be able to demonstrate compliance with the principles of privacy by design and by default (Article 5(2) and 24(1) GDPR). The last paragraph of Article\u00a025 offers the controller some guidance on how to demonstrate such compliance (similar to Article 24(3) GDPR ). It states that an \"approved certification mechanism pursuant to Article 42 \" may be used as an element to demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out in the first two paragraphs of the provision. Hence, just like in Article 24(3) , it follows from the word \"element\" that such adherence only supports the assumption that the controller is compliant, and does not prove it. [ 49 ] \"Even where a processing operation is awarded a certification in accordance with Article 42, the controller still has the responsibility to continuously monitor and improve compliance with the [Data Protection by Design and by Default]-criteria of Article 25.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 4/2019 on Article 25 Data Protection by Design and by Default\u2019, 20 October 2020 (Version 2.0), margin number 91. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 25 GDPR \u2191 The Data Protection Directive did not contain a similar provision. Although Article 17 DPD Recital 46 had a similar thrust, the focus in those provisions revolved mostly around security. See, Bygrave , in Kuner, Bygrave, Docksey, The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): A Commentary, Article 25 GDPR, p. 573 (Oxford University Press 2020). However, these concepts were not new: privacy by design -and default was originally conceptualized in the 1990s by the Canadian Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario. They held that, in order to be effective, data protection must be implemented ex ante . Hence, the controller must define the privacy requirements that need to be taken into account while engineering, and determine the default settings of the final product.

Beck 2022, 3rd Edition). \u2191 Bygrave , in Kuner, Bygrave, Docksey, The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): A Commentary, Article 25 GDPR, p. 576 (Oxford University Press 2020). \u2191 Hartung , in K\u00fchling, Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 25, margin number 30 (C.H.

Decisions 5 References 1.   Where two or more controllers jointly determine the purposes and means of processing, they shall be joint controllers. They shall in a transparent manner determine their respective responsibilities for compliance with the obligations under this Regulation, in particular as regards the exercising of the rights of the data subject and their respective duties to provide the information referred to in Articles 13 and 14, by means of an arrangement between them unless, and in so far as, the respective responsibilities of the controllers are determined by Union or Member State law to which the controllers are subject. The arrangement may designate a contact point for data subjects. 2.   The arrangement referred to in paragraph 1 shall duly reflect the respective roles and relationships of the joint controllers vis-\u00e0-vis the data subjects. The essence of the arrangement shall be made available to the data subject. 3.   Irrespective of the terms of the arrangement referred to in paragraph 1, the data subject may exercise his or her rights under this Regulation in respect of and against each of the controllers. Article 26 implements the concept of joint controllership for cases in which two or more controllers together determine the purposes and means of processing. The goal of this provision is to achieve a clear allocation of the responsibilities under the GDPR between the joint controllers. Therefore, the joint controllers have to jointly determine the respective compliance responsibilities in an agreement between them. The provision also empowers data subjects, who should not suffer any disadvantage due to the joint controllership, by requiring transparency and accountability where multiple controllers jointly engage in processing operations. Data subjects should be informed of the essence of this arrangement to strengthen their understanding of the processing and facilitate the exercise of their rights against each controller. EDPB and Article 29 Working Party Guidelines : relevant guidelines for this Article are (i) EDPB, 'Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR', 7 July 2021 (Version 2.1) (available here ); (ii) WP29, 'Opinion 1/2010 on the concepts of \"controller\" and \"processor\"', 264/10/EN WP169, 16 February 2010 (available here ). Under Article 26(1) GDPR, joint controllership takes place when two or more controllers \" jointly determine the purposes and means of processing \". Joint controllership does not arise in all cases of processing involving multiple entities. The key factor for determining joint controllership is the collective involvement of two or more entities in deciding the purposes and means of processing. [ 1 ] If two or more entities involved have a say in deciding on these aspects, these entities should be regarded as joint controllers for that particular processing activity. [ 2 ] According to the definition in Article 4(7) GDPR a controller is someone - who alone or jointly with others - determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. In order to be determined a joint controller, an entity must independently meet the definition of controller in Article 4(7) GDPR . [ 3 ] If the determination of the purposes and means of the processing happens by a cooperation of at least two controllers together (i.e. jointly), they are joint controllers . This is the case when at least two actors have a decisive influence over whether and how the processing takes place. [ 4 ] In order to establish wether the different parties involved in any data protection activity are indeed controllers, it is important that those parties consider their respective rolls in the processing and in advance instead of retrospectively. [ 5 ] Particularly challenging is the distinction between joint controllers , processors (see Article 28 GDPR ) and separate independent controllers in situations with multiple actors in a processing activities. For a commentary on the purposes and means of processing see the definition of the controller in Article 4(7) GDPR . The term \u201cjointly\u201d must be interpreted as meaning \u201c together with \u201d or \u201c not alone \u201d. In other words, attention must be paid to whether multiple entities act in a joint manner. This assessment of joint participation should be based on a factual, rather than formal basis. [ 6 ] There are various ways in which joint participation can occur. For instance, it can manifest as a \" common decision \" [ 7 ] made by multiple entities or arise from \" converging decisions \", which occur when controllers take decisions that complement one another separately. [ 8 ] An important criterion to identify converging decisions in this context is whether the processing would not be possible without both parties\u2019 participation in the purposes and means in the sense that the processing by each party is inseparable, i.e. inextricably linked. The situation of joint controllers acting on the basis of converging decisions should however be distinguished from the case of a processor, since the latter \u2013 while participating in the performance of a processing \u2013 does not process the data for its own purposes but carries out the processing on behalf of the controller. [ 9 ] In practice, it very much depends on the specific case in which the cooperation and participation of the actors can take various forms and can also be unevenly distributed. [ 10 ] According to the CJEU the joint controllers can even be involved at different stages of the processing and to different degrees. [ 11 ] However, Only when the joint participation leads to the joint determination of the purpose and means of the processing the controllers act as joint controllers. [ 12 ] For example, the CJEU confirmed, that the provider of an online marketplace on which users could post advertisements is regularly a joint controller with the advertisers since it participates in the determination of the purpose and means of the processing in regards to the publication of the advertisement. [ 13 ] The same is true for search engines, where its activity plays a decisive role in the overall dissemination of personal data as that activity renders those data publicly accessible online in an organised and aggregated manner. [ 14 ] [W]here the operator of an online marketplace [...] sets the parameters for the dissemination of advertisements likely to contain personal data depending on the recipients concerned, determines the presentation and duration of that dissemination or the headings structuring the information published, or even organises the classification which will determine the arrangements for such dissemination, it participates in the determination of the essential elements of the publication of the personal data concerned, thereby exerting a decisive influence on the overall dissemination of those data.\" CJEU - C-492/23 - Russmedia , margin number 72. However, it is not necessary that all joint controller actually have access to the personal data that is processed. [ 15 ] [A] sectoral organisation, in so far as it proposes to its members a framework of rules that it has established relating to consent to the processing of personal data, which contains not only binding technical rules but also rules setting out in detail the arrangements for storing and disseminating personal data relating to such consent, must be classified as a \u2018joint controller\u2019 [...] where [...] it exerts influence over the personal data processing at issue, for its own purposes, and determines, as a result, jointly with its members, the purposes and means of such processing. The fact that such a sectoral organisation does not itself have direct access to the personal data processed by its members under those rules does not preclude it from holding the status of joint controller for the purpose of those provisions.\" CJEU - C-604/22 - IAB Europe , margin number 58. Also, the use of joint infrastructure or a common data processing system will not automatically result in joint controllership, especially in instances where the processing is carried out separately and the operations of the parties do not necessarily overlap. [ 16 ] But if, for example, two or more controllers develop and use a joint infrastructure together they are likely to be considered joint controller for such the respective processing on the joint infrastructure. [ 17 ] Jointly determining the purposes and means of processing does not necessarily mean that two or more controllers must have the same purpose for the processing. According to the CJEU: \" [T]he determination of the purposes and means of processing can take different forms, since such participation can result from a common decision taken by two or more entities or from converging decisions of those entities. However, where the latter is the case, those decisions must complement each other in such a manner that they each have a tangible impact on the determination of the purposes and means of the processing. \" [ 18 ] Joint controllers are also not required to exert influence over the purposes and means of processing at the same point in time. [ 19 ] Furthermore, there are scenarios where different actors sequentially process the same personal data in a chain of operations. Each of these actors has an autonomous purpose and independent means within their respective part of the chain. If there is no joint participation in determining the purposes and means of the same processing operation or set of operations, joint controllership must be ruled out. In such cases, the various actors should be considered successive independent controllers . [ 20 ] Hence, collaboration between two controllers does not always result in joint controllership. In instances where controllers process data independently of each other and for their own purposes, they will not be considered to be joint controllers. For example, the exchange of the same data or set of data between two entities without jointly determined purposes or jointly determined means of processing should be considered as a transmission of data between separate controllers. Joint controllership \" may also be excluded in a situation where several entities use a shared database or a common infrastructure, if each entity independently determines its own purposes .\" [ 21 ] Example : A group of companies uses the same database for the management of clients and prospects. Such database is hosted on the servers of the parent company who is therefore a processor of the companies with respect to the storage of the data. Each entity of the group enters the data of its own clients and prospects and processes such data for its own purposes only. Also, each entity decides independently on the access, the retention periods, the correction or deletion of their clients and prospects\u2019 data. They cannot access or use each other\u2019s data. The mere fact that these companies use a shared group database does not as such entail joint controllership. Under these circumstances, each company is a separate controller. [ 22 ] A helpful tool for (joint) controllers as well as processors ist the flowchart provided by the EDPB in order to evaluate an actor's data protection role in a processing activity. [ 23 ] According to Article 26(1) of the GDPR, joint controllers are required to determine and agree on their respective responsibilities for fulfilling the obligations set forth in the Regulation. This process should be transparent , ensuring that it is clear and explicit which tasks each joint controller is responsible for regarding the specific joint processing activity. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that, in situations where multiple actors are involved, responsibility for GDPR compliance is clearly allocated. To achieve this, the EDPB clarifies that responsibilities should be assigned taking into account the contractual party's proximity to the specific processing. In other words, once again, the factual circumstances help determine who should be responsible for what. Independent of the agreement between the controllers the relevant circumstances and the internal assessment regarding the allocated responsibilities should be documented. [ 24 ] Example : In case only one of the joint controllers collects personal data from the data subject it might me reasonable that this joint controller is made responsible for informing the data subject in accordance with Article 13 GDPR since this controller is in the best position to effectively ensure compliance with this obligation. The aim of the agreement between the parties, as mentioned, is to ensure compliance with the GDPR. In this regard, the second sentence of Article 26(1) highlights the importance of paying particular attention to the exercise of data subject rights and the information obligations outlined in Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR. This is intended to prevent negative consequences of the involvement of more than one controller for the data subjects regarding these aspects of compliance (rights and transparency). Nevertheless, as the inclusion of the phrase \"i n particular \" shows, the obligations related to the allocation of compliance responsibilities among the involved parties are not exhaustive. Therefore, it can be inferred that the distribution of compliance responsibilities among joint controllers is not confined to the specific topics mentioned in Article 26(1), but also encompasses other obligations of controllers under the GDPR. The EDPB lists a number of compliance measures and related obligations that must be considered when joint controllers determine their respective responsibilities: the implementation of general data protection principles (Article 5), determination of the legal basis for processing (Article 6), implementation of security measures (Article 32), notification of personal data breaches to the supervisory authority and data subjects (Articles 33 and 34), conducting Data Protection Impact Assessments (Articles 35 and 36), engaging a processor (Article 28), ensuring compliance with data transfer requirements for third countries (Chapter V), and organizing communication with data subjects and supervisory authorities. [ 25 ] Joint responsibility does not necessarily mean that the responsibilities of the involved controllers is distributed evenly between them. [ 26 ] And some obligations cannot be distribute at all and the joint controllers individually need to comply with the same requirements. This can be the case for the for each joint controller's obligation to maintain a record of processing activities or to appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) if the conditions outlined in Article 30 or 37(1) respectively are met. These requirements are not specifically tied to the joint processing activity but are applicable to each controller individually. [ 27 ] The form of the agreement is not prescribed, and the parties are generally free to decide on it. However, this document defines their responsibilities, so in order to provide clarity and legal certainty between the parties seems reasonable. [ 28 ] This form also facilitates the controller's task of demonstrating compliance with the GDPR (see Article 24 GDPR). Of course the formal agreement should also reflect the actual distribution of responsibilities and obligations. [ 29 ] The agreement should be able to describe the \" respective responsibilities \" in a \" transparent manner \" meaning it should be written in clear and straightforward language. Additionally, to provide a better framework for the allocation of responsibilities between the parties, the arrangement should also includes general information about the joint processing. This should include specifying the relationship between the joint controllers; the function of each controller; and a description of the processing activity including the subject matter and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data involved, and the categories of data subjects. [ 30 ] The formal agreement between the controllers should, in particular, also include the distribution of responsibilities in connection with the rights of the data subjects and the respective obligations of the controllers. If on of the controllers act as a designated contact point for the data subject, that fact should also be reflected in the agreement. [ 31 ] The existence of such a formal agreement is no preconditions for two or more entities to be considered joint controllers, rather it is an obligation imposed on joint controllers, when they have been classified as such. [ 32 ] The agreement between the joint controllers can be combined with other agreements between the same parties. However, the transparency of the determination of the respective agreements must not be undermined by such a combination. [ 33 ] Each controller should be aware that the fact that a processing activity falls under the joint controllership of more than one controller has to be recorded in the record of processing activities in accordance with Article 30(1)(a) GDPR as well as in a notice to the supervisory authority in connection with a prior consultation in accordance with Article 36(3)(a) GDPR . In essence, the information in these documents should therefore correspond with the information in the agreement between the joint controllers. While the implementation of a single contact point for data subjects is not mandatory, it can serve two important purposes. First, it enables data subjects to know whom to approach for any matters related to the processing of their personal data. Secondly, it allows the joint controllers to coordinate their interactions and communications with data subjects more efficiently. In order to facilitate the exercise of data subjects' rights as per the GDPR, the EDPB recommends that joint controllers designate a contact point for this purpose. This contact point can be the Data Protection Officer (DPO) of one of the joint controllers or the representative in the Union (for joint controllers not established in the Union), or any other designated contact point where relevant information can be obtained. [ 34 ] Article 26 GDPR requires the joint controllers have an arrangement that clearly allocates the roles of each party. This is not an absolute rule. Where the responsibilities of the controller are determined by Union or Member State law, an arrangement between the controllers is not necessary. [ 35 ] Thus, \" the respective responsibilities of joint controllers of personal data do not necessarily depend on the existence of an arrangement between the various controllers [...], but may stem from national law. \" [ 36 ] Such a determination by Union or  Member State law also takes precedence over any respective agreement between the joint controllers. [ 37 ] Joint controllers must clarify their respective roles in the arrangement, particularly concerning the exercise of data subject rights and their obligations to provide information as outlined in Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR (see above). Article 26(2) of the GDPR emphasizes the significance of these specific obligations. Joint controllers must establish how and by whom the required information will be provided to data subjects and how and by whom responses to data subject requests will be handled. The organization of these obligations in the arrangement should accurately reflect the reality of the joint processing. For instance, if only one of the joint controllers is responsible for communicating with data subjects regarding the joint processing, that controller may be better positioned to inform data subjects and address their requests effectively. [ 38 ] While the joint controllership agreement is binding between the controllers as parties to the agreement the data subject is not bound by the agreement; for them it is a tool to increase transparency. [ 39 ] The \" essence \" of the arrangement should be made available to the data subject, in order to provide transparency on processing operations. What should be covered by the notion of \u201cessence of the arrangement\u201d is not specified by the GDPR. The EDPB recommends that data subjects are provided with, at least, all the elements of the information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 GDPR, and for each of these elements, the data subjects should be made aware of the arrangement between the joint controller regarding the responsibility for ensuring compliance with the respective element. Moreover, the data subject should be able to understand which data controller serves as a point of contact for the exercise of their data subject rights. [ 40 ] The obligation to provide the essence of the agreement between the joint controllers to data subjects originates from the transparency principle of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR . However, the validity of the agreement between the controllers is independent of the respective information of the data subject. [ 41 ] The GDPR does not specify how the information regarding the joint arrangement should be made available to the data subject. Unlike other provisions such as Article 30(4) GDPR for the record of processing or Article 40(11) GDPR for the register of approved codes of conduct, Article 26(2) GDPR does not explicitly require the information to be made available \"upon request\" or \"publicly available by way of appropriate means\". As a result, it is the responsibility of the joint controllers to determine the most effective approach for providing the essence of the arrangement to data subjects. [ 42 ] In most cases, it will be appropriate to include the information of the essence of the agreement in the initial information to the data subject ( Article 13 or 14 GDPR ) and in any response to an access request in accordance with Article 15 GDPR . [ 43 ] Joint controllers should ensure that the information is consistently provided in a coherent manner. Example : In order to comply with the the obligation to provide data subjects with the essence of the agreement between joint controllers they include this information alongside the information outlined in Article 13 or 14 GDPR, within their privacy policy, and upon request by a data subject to the designated data protection officer or contact point. Generally, the joint controllers don't have to provide the data subject with the full agreement. Also, the commercial agreement between the parties (if included in the same agreement) do not have to be provided to the data subject. [ 44 ] It should be noted that under Article 26(3) GDPR , a data subject is not bound by the terms of the joint controllers\u2019 arrangement, and may actually exercise their rights against each of the joint data controllers. This allows for further empowerment of the data subject who's position should not be deteriorated by the fact that more actors are involved in he processing of their personal data. Example: A data subject's personal data is processed by joint controllers established in different member states. The data subject can choose to contact the controller established in the member state most convenient to the data subject (e.g. the controller established in their home country). [ 45 ] Therefore, even if the agreement between the joint controllers stipulate that one specific controller handles access requests and the data subjects are made aware of that, the data subject is free to make an access request with one of the other joint controllers. The joint controllership agreement should anticipate that and could require the controller receiving the request to forward it to the responsible controller. [ 46 ] However, independent of agreement  between the joint controllers (and the actual internal handling of a request between the joint controllers), the receiver of the data subject's requests remains responsible to the data subject for the request. [ 47 ] Besides compliance with data subjects rights joint controllers are also jointly liable for damages in case a data subject suffered material or non-material damages as a result of an infringement of the GDPR in connection with the respective processing activity (see commentary to Article 82(4) GDPR ). \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 26 GDPR \u2191 Petri , in Simitis, Hornung, Spiecker gen.

Firstly, there are situations where the formal appointment of a joint controller, mandated by law or contract, may be missing. Secondly, there are cases where the formal appointment does not accurately reflect the actual arrangements, as it may assign the role of controller to an entity that does not have the authority to \"determine\" the purposes and means of the processing.

Continued liability 4 Decisions 5 References 1.   Where Article 3(2) applies, the controller or the processor shall designate in writing a representative in the Union. 2.   The obligation laid down in paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply to: 3.   The representative shall be established in one of the Member States where the data subjects, whose personal data are processed in relation to the offering of goods or services to them, or whose behaviour is monitored, are. 4.   The representative shall be mandated by the controller or processor to be addressed in addition to or instead of the controller or the processor by, in particular, supervisory authorities and data subjects, on all issues related to processing, for the purposes of ensuring compliance with this Regulation. 5.   The designation of a representative by the controller or processor shall be without prejudice to legal actions which could be initiated against the controller or the processor themselves. The aim of Article 27 GDPR is to ensure that the level of protection afforded to EU-based data subjects is not reduced where non-EU based controllers or processors process their data. This provision demands the existence a contact point for data subjects and intends to ensure that there is legal accountability for processing activities by mandating the appointment of a representative, unless one of the exemptions in Article 27(2) GDPR apply. This representative can be subject to enforcement proceedings in the event of non-compliance with the GDPR. Article 27 GDPR also helps to clarify the scope of obligations placed on controllers and processors based outside of the EU. EDPB Guidelines: for this Article see EDPB, 'Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3)', 12 November 2019 (Version 2.1), (available here ). In case the territorial scope of Article 3(2) GDPR applies to a controller or processor not established in the Union (due to the processing of personal data of data subjects in the Union related to either the offering of goods or services to such data subjects or the monitoring of their behaviour in the Union), [ 1 ] the controller or processor must designate a representative in the Union. [ 2 ] \"Data controllers or processors subject to the GDPR as per its Article 3(2) are under the obligation to designate a representative in the Union. A controller or processor not established in the Union but subject to the GDPR failing to designate a representative in the Union would therefore be in breach of the Regulation.\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3)', 12 November 2019 (Version 2.1), page 23. The obligation to designate a representative in the Union is directed at controllers and processors established outside of the union but performing some kind of processing targeting data subject in the Union (i.e. falling under Article 3(2) GDPR ). If more than one processing activities of the controller or processor fall under Article 3(2) GDPR, it is sufficient to designate one representative. At the same time, one representative can act on behalf of one or more controllers and/or processors outside of the Union. [ 3 ] The designation of the representative must be done in writing. This is necessary to guarantee the authenticity of the mandate and to ensure a certain tangibility of the parties involved. Qualified electronic signature or other equivalent method would also be admissible. However, this agreement could not be concluded by email. [ 4 ] In practice, the function of representative in the Union can be exercised based on a contract concluded between the controller or processor and an individual or an organization, provided that the individual or organization is established in the Union. The role can be assumed by a wide range of commercial and non-commercial entities, such as law firms, consultancies, or private companies. [ 5 ] However, according to the EDPB, the role should not overlap with the DPO\u2019s role given its requirement for independence. [ 6 ] \"Similarly, given the possible conflict of obligation and interests in cases of enforcement proceedings, the EDPB does not consider the function of a data controller representative in the Union as compatible with the role of data processor for that same data controller, in particular when it comes to compliance with their respective responsibilities and compliance.\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3)', 12 November 2019 (Version 2.1), page 24 et seq. A representative is defined in Article 4(17) GDPR as a \"a natural or legal person established in the Union who, designated by the controller or processor in writing pursuant to Article 27, represents the controller or processor with regard to their respective obligations under this Regulation\". The GDPR does not specify any particular requirements for the representative. [ 7 ] However, under Article 4(17) GDPR , the representative must be capable of representing the controller or processor \"with regard to their obligations under this Regulation\". [ 8 ] Therefore, the representative should act on behalf of the controller or processor according to the mandate received. [ 9 ] The representative should also act as a (possible) point of contact for data subjects as well as for supervisory authorities [ 10 ] and should be able to provide documentation to the authorities like the record of processing activities. [ 11 ] The information provided to data subjects under Articles 13(1)(a) and 14(1)(a) GDPR must contain information of the controller's representative. For example: A company established in the US is the provider of a webshop directed to data subjects in the Union. According to Article 27 GDPR the controller must designate a representative in the Union (in the on of the member states where the products are offered). The representative designated by the controller or processor should be subject to enforcement proceedings in case of non-compliance by the controller or the processor. [ 12 ] However, the designation of a representative does not exclude the responsibility or liability of the controller or processor themselves. [ 13 ] It remains unclear how compliance of the GDPR by entities not providing such a representative should be effectively ensured (e.g. regarding public authorities that are excluded from the designation of a representative). [ 14 ] Arguably, also a voluntary designation of a representative is possible. [ 15 ] It should be noted however, that the one-stop-shop mechanism ( Article 60 et seqq. GDPR ) is not applicable for controllers and processors outside of the Union. The requirement to designate a representative is not absolute. Article 27(2) GDPR presents two instances in which the requirement to have a representative does not apply. These are (a) when the processing is occasional, does not include data covered by Article 9 GDPR or Article 10 GDPR , and is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, and (b) when the processing is done by a public authority or body. It should be noted that all processing activities of a controller under Article 3(2) GDPR should be considered; if just one of those activities does not fall under one of the exceptions below, a representative has to be designated for all processing activities under Article 3(2) GDPR (if not otherwise agreed upon). [ 16 ] The first exemption in Article 27(2)(a) GDPR states that the requirement to designate a representative does not apply if the processing meets three cumulative conditions: First, the processing must be \" occasional \". A processing activity can be considered occasional if it is not carried out regularly and is not part of the regular course of business or activity of the controller or processor. [ 17 ] In other words, occasional refers to a \"non-systematic\" processing, i.e. a processing happening on an ad hoc and infrequent basis and not in a regular way. [ 18 ] Second, it must not include \" processing of special categories of data as referred to in Article 9(1) or processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10 \" on a large scale. What meaning should be assigned to the expression \u201c large scale \u201d is not entirely clear but considerations could include a temporal, quantitative or qualitative aspects. [ 19 ] Recital 91 mentions processing operations which aim to process \" a considerable amount of personal data [...] which could affect a large number of data subjects \". \"[T] the following factors, in particular, be considered when determining whether the processing is carried out on a large scale: the number of data subjects concerned - either as a specific number or as a proportion of the relevant population; the volume of data and/or the range of different data items being processed; the duration, or permanence, of the data processing activity; the geographical extent of the processing activity.\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3)', 12 November 2019 (Version 2.1), page 25 et seq. Third, the processing must be \" unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons \". Thus, processing activities with a (not unlikely) risk to data subjects can not be subject to this exception to delegate designate a representative in the Union. Recital 75 GDPR sets out that when the risk to the rights and freedom of data subjects is being assessed, special consideration should be given to both its likelihood and severity. This includes, inter alia , risks of discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, damage to the reputation, loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional secrecy, unauthorized reversal of pseudonymisation, or any other significant economic or social disadvantage. The unifying factor of these three (cumulative) conditions is the existence of processing which is in some way 'non-negligible' because of its scale, the data processed, or its possible negative consequences. In all the other cases, a representative in the Union must be appointed and the exemption in Article 27(1)(a) GDPR cannot apply. The second exemption to the requirement to designate a representative applies if the non-EU controller or processor is a public authority or body. The reason for this is exception is the territoriality principle in international law. According to this principle, no state has power or jurisdiction over another state and the Union cannot unilaterally impose requirements on another state or its public authorities. [ 20 ] It is up for the supervisory authority to assess on a case-by-case basis what constitutes a public authority or body. [ 21 ] It should be considered whether the potential public authority or body processes personal data for their public purposes. [ 22 ] However, instances in which a public authority or body in a third country would be monitoring the behaviour of data subjects in the Union, or offering them goods or services, are likely to be limited. [ 23 ] Article 27(3) GDPR states that the representative of the controller or processor shall be established in one of the Member States where the data subjects whose personal data are processed in relation to the offering of goods or services to them, or whose behaviour is monitored, are located. \"In cases where a significant proportion of data subjects whose personal data are processed are located in one particular Member State, the EDPB recommends, as a good practice, that the representative is established in that same Member State. However, the representative must remain easily accessible for data subjects in Member States where it is not established and where the services or goods are being offered or where the behaviour is being monitored.\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3)', 12 November 2019 (Version 2.1), page 26. The main criterion for establishing where a representative should be designated is the location of the data subjects who are subject to the processing. [ 24 ] One way to interpret this is in the event that there are two member states in which processing takes place, the country which has more data subjects who are subject to the processing should be the country in which the representative is established. However, the wording of the provision implies that the controller or processor is free to designate a representative in a Member State of his choice as long as some of the affected data subjects are in this member state. [ 25 ] While Article 27(1) GDPR mandates a designation of the representative in a written form, Article 27(4) GDPR specifies that the representative's mandate must include that the representative's competence to be addressed in addition to or instead of the controller or the processor by, in particular, supervisory authorities and data subjects, on all issues related to processing, for the purposes of ensuring compliance \" with the GDPR. The representative's mandate can also include other responsibilities not explicitly stated in the GDPR. [ 26 ] Therefore, data subjects, supervisory authorities or any other party can address the representative on \" all issues related to processing \" in order to \"ensure compliance with\" the GDPR. This can be done \" in addition to or instead of \" addressing the controller or processor themselves. This wording seems to imply that the controller or processor mandating the representative can choose the respective scope of the representation (i.e. if the representative should by the sole or an additional point of contact). [ 27 ] In any way, this means that the main role of the representative is to serve as a(n additional) point of contact and be readily available for supervisory authorities, data subjects and other interested parties regarding data protection matters. Regarding the communication with data subjects, the representative has to provide relevant information (as particularly stipulated in Articles 13(1)(a) and 14(1)(a) GDPR ), and facilitate inquiries by data subjects by, inter alia , accepting documents or requests for the controller or processor. \"While not itself responsible for complying with data subject rights, the representative must facilitate the communication between data subjects and the controller or processor represented, in order to make the exercise of data subjects\u2019 rights are effective.\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3)', 12 November 2019 (Version 2.1), page 27. Article 27(4) GDPR also stipulates that the representative must be mandated to be a point of contact for supervisory authorities. Recital 80 GDPR, clarifies that the representative should cooperate with the supervisory authorities regarding any action that may need to be taken in order to comply with the GDPR. Such obligation is also mandated in Article 31 GDPR . \"In practice, this means that a supervisory authority would contact the representative in connection with any matter relating to the compliance obligations of a controller or processor established outside the Union, and the representative shall be able to facilitate any informational or procedural exchange between a requesting supervisory authority and a controller or processor established outside the Union.\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3)', 12 November 2019 (Version 2.1), page 27. Under Article 30 GDPR the representative of the controller or processor must maintain a record of the processing activities performed by the controller or processor. However, the controller or processor themselves are responsible for updating the content of the record, and must provide the representative with up-to-date information. [ 28 ] At the same time, the representative must be ready to share this record which should also enable the representative to give more qualified responses to supervisory authorities as well as to data subjects. [ 29 ] To fulfil all of these responsibilities effectively, the representative may enlist the support of a team and ensure effective communication in the appropriate languages. [ 30 ] Common mistake: It should be noted that the position of a controller's or processor's representative is not compatible with the role of the same controller's or processor's DPO or (sub)processor. Article 27(5) GDPR makes it very clear that the controller or processor cannot escape legal liability by designating a representative. \"[T]he designation of a representative in the Union does not affect the responsibility and liability of the controller or of the processor under the GDPR and shall be without prejudice to legal actions which could be initiated against the controller or the processor themselves. The GDPR does not establish a substitutive liability of the representative in place of the controller or processor it represents in the Union.\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3)', 12 November 2019 (Version 2.1), page 6 (available). Indeed, it states that legal action can be initiated directly against the controller or processor. This notably happened in a case before the Austrian DPA, in which it chose to address a decision directly to a US company instead of its representative in the Netherlands, because \u201c Article 27(5) GDPR does not entail a transfer of responsibility \u201d. [ 31 ] Direct liability of the representative is limited to the obligations set out in Article 30 and Article 58(1)(a) GDPR ; however, supervisory authorities can address corrective measures or administrative fines and penalties imposed on the controller or processor directly to the representative. [ 32 ] \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 27 GDPR \u2191 Article 3(2) GDPR can be divided into two requirements: first, there must be processing by a controller or processor who is not established in the Union, and second, the processing activities must relate either to the offering of goods or services, or to the monitoring of the behaviour of the data subjects within the Union. \u2191 EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3)\u2019, 12 November 2019 (Version 2.1), p. 23 (available here ). \u2191 EDPB, 'Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3)', 12 November 2019 (Version 2.1), page 24 (available here ). \u2191 Martini , in Paal, Pauly, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 27, margin numbers 17-20 (C.H.Beck 2021, 3rd Edition). \u2191 Gola , in Gola, Heckmann, DS-GVO, Article 4 GDPR, margin number 131 (C.H.

Indeed, this is what Millard and Kamarinou have labeled as enhancing the \u201c practical-procedural traction of the GDPR \u201d.

Decisions 5 References 1.   Where processing is to be carried out on behalf of a controller, the controller shall use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that processing will meet the requirements of this Regulation and ensure the protection of the rights of the data subject. 2.   The processor shall not engage another processor without prior specific or general written authorisation of the controller. In the case of general written authorisation, the processor shall inform the controller of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of other processors, thereby giving the controller the opportunity to object to such changes. 3.   Processing by a processor shall be governed by a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law, that is binding on the processor with regard to the controller and that sets out the subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the controller. That contract or other legal act shall stipulate, in particular, that the processor: With regard to point (h) of the first subparagraph, the processor shall immediately inform the controller if, in its opinion, an instruction infringes this Regulation or other Union or Member State data protection provisions. 4.   Where a processor engages another processor for carrying out specific processing activities on behalf of the controller, the same data protection obligations as set out in the contract or other legal act between the controller and the processor as referred to in paragraph 3 shall be imposed on that other processor by way of a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law, in particular providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that the processing will meet the requirements of this Regulation. Where that other processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations, the initial processor shall remain fully liable to the controller for the performance of that other processor's obligations. 5.   Adherence of a processor to an approved code of conduct as referred to in Article 40 or an approved certification mechanism as referred to in Article 42 may be used as an element by which to demonstrate sufficient guarantees as referred to in paragraphs 1 and 4 of this Article. 6.   Without prejudice to an individual contract between the controller and the processor, the contract or the other legal act referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article may be based, in whole or in part, on standard contractual clauses referred to in paragraphs 7 and 8 of this Article, including when they are part of a certification granted to the controller or processor pursuant to Articles 42 and 43. 7.   The Commission may lay down standard contractual clauses for the matters referred to in paragraph 3 and 4 of this Article and in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2). 8.   A supervisory authority may adopt standard contractual clauses for the matters referred to in paragraph 3 and 4 of this Article and in accordance with the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63. 9.   The contract or the other legal act referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 shall be in writing, including in electronic form. 10.   Without prejudice to Articles 82, 83 and 84, if a processor infringes this Regulation by determining the purposes and means of processing, the processor shall be considered to be a controller in respect of that processing. Complex processing often requires the outsourcing of certain activities to specialised service providers with whom personal data are then shared. If such service provider processes personal data on behalf of the controller, it acts as a processor (as defined in Article 4(8) GDPR ). Even if the controller engages a processor, it continues to determine the purposes and means of the processing. Article 28 GDPR addresses this scenario and establishes the legal framework for such cooperation, thereby ensuring the protection of the data subjects' rights as well as general GDPR compliance. This provision is intended to ensure that the engagement of processors does not lower the level of data protection compared to a situation where the controller processes personal data itself. [ 1 ] Therefore, Article 28(1) GDPR stipulates that controllers should only select appropriate processors that can provide sufficient guarantees to comply with the GDPR. Article 28(2) and (4) GDPR make sure that controllers keep control over any further processors engaged by processors by demanding a prior written authorisation by the controller for the engagement of another processor and by requiring that the agreement between a processor and its sub-processor has the same obligations as the agreement between the controller and its processor. Article 28(3) GDPR provides for specific requirements that the contract or other legal act between a controller and a processor (generally called \"processing agreement\") has to fulfill and what specific clauses have to be included in such document. Article 28(5) GDPR provides for ways that a controller can assess whether a processor provides for sufficient guarantees to comply to the GDPR (i.e. adherence to codes of conduct or an approved certification mechanism). Article 28(6) to (8) GDPR deals with the possibility of the Commission and supervisory authorities adopting standard contractual clauses which can be used by controllers and processors. Article 28(9) GDPR imposes specific form requirements on the contract or other legal act mentioned in paragraphs 3 and 4. Finally, Article 28(10) GDPR determines that a processor acting outside of the agreement with the controller, by determining the purposes and means of processing, has to be considered a controller itself. EDPB Guidelines : Relevant Guidelines for this Article are: EDPB, 'Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR', 7 July 2021 (Version 2.1) (available here ); EDPB, 'Opinion 22/2024 on certain obligations following from the reliance on processor(s) and sub-processor(s)', 7 October 2024, (available here ). Article 28 GDPR governs the relationship between a controller and a processor. Article 28(1) GDPR restricts the extend to which a controller can choose a processor by obliging the controller to use only processors who provide \" sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that processing will meet the requirements of [the GDPR] and ensure the protection of the rights of the data subject \". Therefore, a controller can only work with processors who can provide those guarantees and is responsible for assessing the sufficiency of those guarantees. The controller should be able to prove the performance of such an assessment. [ 2 ] The controller must be able to demonstrate the required technical knowledge, expertise and resources to provide adequate guarantees. [ 3 ] The controller cannot engage processors who are unable to guarantee, with regard to their assigned portion of the processing, compliance with the GDPR and the protection of the data subject's rights. This prohibition is perfectly understandable since the aim of this provision is to ensure a the level of and compliance with data protection regardless of who specifically performs the processing activity. [ 4 ] Conversely, the controller could reduce the guarantees provided by the GDPR simply by outsourcing parts of the processing that it prefers not to invest in. It follows that, before engaging any processor, the controller must carefully check that these requirements are met (see below). This provision also indicates that the controller must have some discretion in the question whether it wants to engage a processor or not. If it the controller is forced to use a specific processor (e.g. in the context of a corporate group), it is questionable if the apparent processor is not rather a controller. [ 5 ] The concept of a \"processor\" is defined in Article 4(8) GDPR . For more information on the concept of processor. see commentary on Article 4(8) GDPR . When considering whether or not to entrust the processing of personal data to a particular processor, controllers should carefully assess whether the processor in question allows them to exercise a sufficient degree of control, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the potential risks for data subjects. A case-by-case analysis remains necessary, however, in order to ascertain the degree of influence each entity effectively has in determining the purposes and means of the processing. [ 6 ] For example: Company X outsources its client support to Company Y who provides a call center in order to help Company X\u2019s clients with their questions. The client support service means that Company Y has to have access to Company X client data bases. Company Y can only access data in order to provide the support that Company X has procured and they cannot process data for any other purposes than the ones stated by Company X. Company Y is to be seen as a personal data processor and a processor agreement must be concluded between Company X and Y. The controller can only use processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that processing will meet the requirements of the Regulation and ensure the protection of the rights of the data subject. [ 7 ] The language used is almost identical to that in the last sentence of Article 25(1) GDPR . The connection seems clear; Article 25 GDPR applies to the controller's own measures, while this provision deals with the processor's measures. According to Recital 81 GDPR, the assessment shall be done \"in terms of expert knowledge, reliability and resources, to implement technical and organisational measures which will meet the requirements of [the] Regulation, including for the security of processing \". More precisely, the controller will have to take different elements into \u201c serious consideration \u201d, including the processor\u2019s privacy policies, terms of service, records of processing activities, management and information security policies, reports of external audits, as well as recognised international certifications (e.g. ISO 27000 series). The controller should also assess the processor\u2019s expert knowledge and technical expertise of security measures and data breaches, reliability and resources. The reputation of the processor in the market may also be a relevant factor. [ 8 ] The controller should also consider the risk connected to the processing activity when assessing the guarantees provided by a potential processor. [ 9 ] Additionally, the controller should document the specific guarantees and technical and organisational measures implemented by a processor in order to be able to comply with its obligations arising under the GDPR (e.g. Articles 5(2) , 24 , 35 , and 36 GDPR). Compliance with those Article will often depend on having such information about the processor. [ 10 ] As stipulated in Article 28(5) GDPR, the adherence of a processor to an approved code of conduct ( Article 40 GDPR ) or an approved certification mechanism ( Article 42 GDPR ) could be used as an element to demonstrate sufficient guarantees (see commentary to Article 28(5) below). However, such adherence only has an indicative effect. [ 11 ] The obligation to use only processors \u201c providing sufficient guarantees \u201d is a continuous one which does not end with the conclusion of the contract. Rather, the controller should verify the processor\u2019s guarantees through audits and inspections at appropriate intervals. [ 12 ] However, this provision does not mandate when or how audits should be conducted. [ 13 ] In a situation where the controller find out that a processor does not comply with the provided guarantees, or that the processor cannot provide those guarantees any longer, the controller has to stop the cooperation with the processor. [ 14 ] For example: After a data breach affects a processor, it becomes apparent to the controller that the processor did not implement the guaranteed data protection safeguards. The controller thus has to make sure that the processor ceases the processing of all personal data on their behalf. If a processor engages another processor, the other processor is usually referred to as a \"sub-processor\". [ 15 ] A sub-processor can also engage other sub-processors, creating additional links to a chain of sub-processors. In cases where a controller engages numerous processors who, in turn, also engage multiple sub-processors, rather complicated structures can arise. Therefore, it is important to note that the controller at the beginning of the chain remains the one determining the purposes and means of the processing. [ 16 ] The situation of a sub-processor is very similar to the position of the processor directly engaged by the controller, since Article 28(4) GDPR demands that sub-processors have basically the same data protection obligations as the processor above them in the processing chain. [ 17 ] In order to appropriately comply with its role as controller, the controller should  have available information relating to the identity of all processors and sub-processors, as well as information on what processing is entrusted to each (sub-)processors. [ 18 ] It is not, however, necessary that a controller can directly audit all of its sub-processors; it is considered sufficient that a processor can audit a sub-processor (and has to do so if required). [ 19 ] Article 28(2) GDPR stipulates that a processor shall not engage another processor (sub-processor) without the prior specific or general written authorisation of the controller. Therefore, this provision prevents a processor from engaging with further processors without the controller's authorisation. This is essential since the latter remains responsible for the processing operations. Therefore, no personal data can be entrusted with a sub-processor without such prior authorisation. [ 20 ] The EDPB highlights that, in order to comply with the accountability principle ( Article 5(2) GDPR ), the controller should be provided not only with the sub-processors name, but also with a list of intended sub-processors, including their location, details of the scope of their activity and applicable safeguards that have been implemented. [ 21 ] The contract or other legal act between the controller and the sub-processor should specify if a specific or general written authorisation by the controller is needed in order for the processor to engage a sub-processor (see below regarding the two types). [ 22 ] \"In cases where the controller decides to accept certain sub-processors at the time of the signature of the contract, a list of approved sub-processors should be included in the contract or an annex thereto. The list should then be kept up to date, in accordance with the general or specific authorisation given by the controller.\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR', 7 July 2021 (Version 2.1), margin number 154. It is noteworthy that the standard contractual clauses provided by the Commission (see commentary on Article 28(7) GDPR) provide for different contractual options regarding the controller's prior authorisation. But regardless of whether the contract or other legal act draws from the standard contractual clauses, the parties should specify the requirements for the written authorisation, the deadline for an approval or objection, and consequences of  such an objection. [ 23 ] According to the EDPB, the controller's prior authorisation can be considered specific , when it refers to a specific sub-processor for a specific processing activity and a specific time. [ 24 ] Any change (e.g. addition of a sub-processor) requires the specific authorisation by the controller before it can take effect. If a processor\u2019s request for a specific authorisation is not answered to within a set time-frame (which should be agreed upon in the contract), it should be held as denied. [ 25 ] For example: A controller contractually agrees with its processor that the processor must not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the controller, without the controller's prior specific written authorisation. Further, they negotiate that, in case the processor wants to engage a sub-processor, it has to submit a request with specific information about the sub-processor (allowing the controller to make an informed assessment). If the controller does not confirm the request in a specified period, the processor cannot engage the sub-processor. A controller can also give a general authorisation for the use of sub-processors. In this case, processors should provide controllers with a list of sub-processors, details as to the type of processing, its relation to specific products or services, and the relevant data protection safeguards that will be in place when processing is undertaken by specific sub-processors. [ 26 ] For this case, Article 28(2) GDPR imposes an explicit obligation of the processors to inform the controller in due time of any intended addition or replacement of sub-processor(s) in order to provide the controller with the opportunity to object (see below). For example: The controller and its processor contractually agree that the processor has the controller's general authorisation for the engagement of sub-processors from an agreed list attached to the processing agreement. The agreement further obliges the processor to inform the controller a specified time in advance and in writing of any intended changes to the list. The processor is also obliged to provide the controller with all information necessary to enable it to make an informed assessment. If the controller does not object to the proposed change, the change is deemed accepted. According to the EDPB, the main difference between general and specific authorisations has to do with the interpretation of the controller\u2019s non-response to a request. [ 27 ] Whereas in a general authorisation scenario the controller\u2019s silence can be interpreted as an authorisation, in a specific authorisation scenario, the controller\u2019s silence has to be interpreted as a refusal. [ 28 ] In both cases, the EDPB has suggested that the relevant communication procedures and timeframes must be included in the controller-processor contract, and that such timeframe must be reasonable depending on the type and complexity of processing. [ 29 ] Article 28(4) GDPR contains further obligations of the processor engaging another processor (see below). \"[I]n the general authorisation situation, the controller\u2019s failure to object within the set timeframe can be interpreted as authorisation.\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR', 7 July 2021 (Version 2.1), margin number 157. In the case the controller gives the processor a general written authorisation to engage a sub-processor, Article 28(2) GDPR obliges the processor to inform the controller of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of other processors. This gives the controller the opportunity to object to such changes. In other words, if the processor decides to change any of the above (e.g. replace a sub-processor) after receiving a general authorisation by the controller, the processor must inform the controller so that it can object to such change. As described above, the controller's failure to respond to such information can be understood as an acceptance by the processor. According to the EDPS, this opportunity to object must be \" meaningful \". [ 30 ] This implies that a \u2018take-it -or-leave-it\u2019 scenario, \" whereby the sole and exclusive remedy of the controller is to terminate its contract with the processor, would not be a meaningful remedy \". This is because, \" in the EDPS\u2019 view, if terminating one service means having to terminate an entire suite of services and if a controller does not consider that a viable business option, that would result in the controller having no choice but to accept a sub-processor \". [ 31 ] The relationship between controller and processor must be defined either by a written contract or another legal act under Union or Member State law (processing between the parties \" shall be governed by a contract or other legal act \"). This is necessary to ensure the transparent allocation of responsibilities and liabilities both internally (between controllers and processors) and externally (towards data subjects and regulators). [ 32 ] Article 28(3) GDPR requires that any shared processing activity between a controller and a processor is based on a contract or another \"legal act\" derived from European or Member State law. [ 33 ] In the absence of at least one of these, the activity will be unlawful and a source of liability. \"Since the Regulation establishes a clear obligation to enter into a written contract, where no other relevant legal act is in force, the absence thereof is an infringement of the GDPR. Both the controller and processor are responsible for ensuring that there is a contract or other legal act to govern the processing. Subject to the provisions of Article 83 of the GDPR, the competent supervisory authority will be able to direct an administrative fine against both the controller and the processor, taking into account the circumstances of each individual case. Contracts that have been entered into before the date of application of the GDPR should have been updated in light of Article 28(3). The absence of such update, in order to bring a previously existing contract in line with the requirements of the  GDPR, constitutes an infringement of Article 28(3). A written contract pursuant to Article 28(3) GDPR may be embedded in a broader contract, such as a service level agreement. In order to facilitate the demonstration of compliance with the GDPR, the EDPB recommends that the elements of the contract that seek to give effect to Article 28 GDPR be clearly identified as such in one place (for example in an annex).\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR', 7 July 2021 (Version 2.1), margin number 103 footnotes omitted. The requirement that engaging a processor for the processing of personal data is subject to a contract or other legal act also makes it necessary that all actors agree on their respective roles in a processing activity. The absence of a clear definition of the relationship between the controller and the processor would be very problematic and would e.g. lead to a lack of legal basis for the processing, especially regarding the transfer of personal data from the controller to the alleged processor and vice versa. The contract or legal act must be in writing, including in electronic form (see form requirements in Article 28(9) GDPR). However, the presence (or absence) of a written arrangement is not decisive in establishing the existence of a controller-processor relationship. The obligation to have a contract or other legal act in place is a consequence of the existence of a controller-processor relationship, and not the cause of such. Therefore, the contract should reflect the factual circumstances.  This means that where an processing agreement does not correspond with reality in terms of actual control, the agreement should be set aside. Conversely, a controller-processor relationship might still exist, even in absence of a written processing agreement or other legal act. This would, however, imply a violation of Article 28(3) GDPR. [ 34 ] \"In most cases, there will be a contract, but the Regulation also refers to \u201cother legal act\u201d, such as a national law (primary or secondary) or other legal instrument. If the legal act does not include all the minimum required content, it must be supplemented with a contract or another legal act that includes the missing elements.\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR', 7 July 2021 (Version 2.1), margin number 102. Finally, the fact that the service provider prepares the contract and its detailed terms of business, rather than the controller, does not pose a problem in itself. It is not sufficient grounds to consider the service provider as a controller. \"the imbalance in the contractual power of a small data controller with respect to big service providers should not be considered as a justification for the controller to accept clauses and terms of contracts which are not in compliance with data protection law, nor can it discharge the controller from its data protection obligations. The controller must evaluate the terms and in so far as it freely accepts them and makes use of the service, it has also accepted full responsibility for compliance with the GDPR. Any proposed modification, by a processor, of data processing agreements included in standard terms and conditions should be directly notified to and approved by the controller, bearing in mind the degree of leeway that the processor enjoys with respect to non-essential elements of the means (see paragraphs 40-41 above). The mere publication of these modifications on the processor\u2019s website is not compliant with Article 28.\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR', 7 July 2021 (Version 2.1), margin number 110 (available here). This provision mandates that the contract or other legal act must be binding on the processor with regards to the controller. This meas that the contract or other legal act must establish obligations on the processor that are binding as a matter of EU or Member State law. However, such a contract or legal act will also set out obligations of the controller. [ 35 ] Article 28(3) GDPR lists a number of minimum requirements that have to be included in the contract or other legal act that governs the engagement of a processor. However, the contract or other legal act should not merely restate the respective provisions; rather, it should be more specific and include information and provisions on how the requirements will be met and which level of security is required. The negotiation of a processing agreement should therefore be considered a chance to specify details of the processing activity. [ 36 ] For the content of the contract, the actors can also draw from standard contractual clauses provided by the commission or supervisory authorities (see commentary on Article 28(6)-8) GDPR below). Naturally, the subject-matter of the processing is a broad concept. Nevertheless, it should make the main object of the processing sufficiently clear. [ 37 ] For example: A processing agreement declares the capturing and storing of video surveillance footage regarding individuals as they enter and exit a highly secure facility as the subject-matter of a processing agreement between the controller and its processor. The duration of the processing refers to the period of time of the processing. Its sufficient to mention the specific criteria used to determine the criteria. Regularly, the duration of the processing agreement will at the same time be the duration of the processing. [ 37 ] The nature of the processing refers to the type of operations performed as part of the processing (e.g. calling data subject, collecting information from a specific source, storing personal data). The purpose should describe what should be archived with the processing activity (for more information on the purpose of the processing see commentary on Article 5(1)(b) GDPR ). [ 37 ] This information should be sufficiently detailed so that it is clear for the parties what the expected processing activity entails. The level of detail should also make the nature and purpose of the processing clear to any data subject or the supervisory authority. [ 38 ] The contract or other legal act has to list the type of personal data involved in the processing. In other words it should list what kind of data will be processed. \" It would not be adequate merely to specify that it is 'personal data pursuant to Article 4(1) GDPR' or 'special categories of personal data pursuant to Article 9'\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR', 7 July 2021 (Version 2.1), margin number 114. The contract or other legal act also has to specify who's personal data will be processed, i.e. the categories of data subjects. This point should also be reasonably detailed (e.g. customers or employees). Specific rights of the controller are mentioned in the list of specific provisions Article 28(3) GDPR mandates to be part of the contract or other legal act governing the processing. Obligations of the controller could include the controller\u2019s obligation to provide the processor with the data mentioned in the contract or other legal act or to provide and document any instruction bearing on the processing of data by the processor, in order to ensure compliance with the obligations set out in the GDPR. [ 37 ] To determine the rights and obligations of the controller, the following aspects, for example, must be taken into account. According to the GDPR, only the controller decides on deletion, correction and access. In particular, the controller is also responsible for checking the general permissibility and lawfulness of processing and must issue sufficient instructions. In particular, this includes the duty of the controller to appear as such and to create transparency for the data subject. [ 39 ] The second part of Article 28(3) GDPR provides a list of elements which must be specifically provided by the contract or other legal act. Therefore, the contract or other legal act must include the following clauses: The contract or other legal act must oblige the processor to act only on documented instructions from the controller, unless otherwise provided for by Union or Member State law. Controllers must provide their processors with instructions related to each processing activity. Such instructions can include permissible and unacceptable handling of personal data, more detailed procedures, ways of securing data, etc. [ 40 ] The contract can provide the parties with procedures and templates to communicate \u201c documented \u201d instructions. For these purposes, it is recommended to include a procedure and a template for giving further instructions in an annex to the contract or other legal act. However, instructions can be given by different means (e.g. e-mail) as long as it is possible to keep records of them. [ 41 ] In general, the processor shall not go beyond what is instructed by the controller. However, this is admitted when the processor is obligated by EU law or Member State law to process or transfer personal data. In such cases, the processor must inform the controller about such requirements before commencing the processing. However, if the same (EU or Member State) law prohibits the processor from informing the controller due to \"important grounds of public interest,\" there is no obligation to provide this information. This provision emphasises the importance of carefully negotiating and drafting data processing agreements. Both parties may need to seek legal advice to determine the existence of any such legal requirement. Regardless, any transfer or disclosure can only occur if authorized by Union law, including in accordance with Article 48 GDPR . [ 42 ] The provision clarifies that the rules on documented instructions also apply to transfers in the sense of Articles 44 et seqq. GDPR . The contract should specify the requirements for transfers to third countries or international organisations, taking into account the provisions of Chapter V of the GDPR. If the instructions by the controller \" do not allow for transfers or disclosures to third countries, the processor will not be allowed to assign the processing to a sub-processor in a third country, nor will he be allowed to have the data processed in one of his non-EU divisions \". [ 43 ] The contract should explicitly state that the processor is responsible for ensuring that anyone authorised to process the personal data is bound by confidentiality. This can be achieved through a specific contractual agreement or existing statutory obligations. The term \"persons authorized to process the personal data\" encompasses both employees and temporary workers. In general, the processor should only grant access to the personal data to employees who require it to perform the tasks for which the processor was engaged by the controller. [ 44 ] Article 28(3)(c) of the GDPR requires that the contract or other binding agreement impose on the processor the obligation to implement the security measures mandated by Article 32 GDPR . [ 45 ] The EDPB emphasises that a mere reference to the obligations stemming from Article 32 GDPR is not sufficient. The contract or binding act must, at the very least, (i) specify the security measures to be implemented, (ii) introduce an obligation on the processor not to modify these measures without prior authorization from the controller, and (iii) require the parties to continuously review the measures to ensure their adequacy and effectiveness. This level of specificity is necessary to appropriately assess risks. Furthermore, it is the only way for the controller to fulfill its accountability obligations under Articles 5(2) and 24 of the GDPR. [ 46 ] \"The level of instructions provided by the controller to the processor as to the measures to be implemented will depend on the specific circumstances. In some cases, the controller may provide a clear and detailed description of the security measures to be implemented. In other cases, the controller may describe the minimum security objectives to be achieved, while requesting the processor to propose implementation of specific security measures. In any event, the controller must provide the processor with a description of the processing activities and security objectives (based on the controller\u2019s risk assessment), as well as approve the measures proposed by the processor. This could be included in an annex to the contract. The controller exercises its decision-making power over the main features of the security measures, be it by explicitly listing the measures or by approving those proposed by the processor.\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR', 7 July 2021 (Version 2.1), margin number 127 (available here). As explained above, processors should obtain prior specific or general authorisation to use sub-processors or to change arrangements with existing sub-processors. If the processor engages another processor, they must establish a contract that imposes the same data protection obligations as those imposed on the original processor. Alternatively, these obligations can be imposed through another legal act based on Union or Member State law. This requirement also encompasses the obligation specified in Article 28(3)(h) to facilitate and cooperate with audits conducted by the controller or an auditor appointed by the controller. The processor bears liability to the controller for ensuring that the other processor complies with data protection obligations. The contract or legal act must further regulate these aspects. [ 47 ] See also Commentary on Article 28(2) and (4) GDPR. The controller remains responsible for overall compliance with the GDPR and, specifically, for handling data subject rights requests under Articles 12-22 GDPR , regardless of the involvement of processors. The same goes for the other requirements set forth in Article 12 GDPR . For example, the deadlines set out in Article 12 GDPR cannot be extended by the controller based on the fact that the necessary information must be provided by the processor. However, processors do exist: they hold, store, disclose, & process personal data on their systems. For example, consider a request for erasure under Article 17, where some of the data is physically located with the processor. In order to fulfill its obligations, the controller requires the cooperation of the processor. This is why, under Article 28(3)(e) GDPR, the processors shall nevertheless be obliged to assist the controller. Typically, this consists of promptly forwarding any requests received from data subjects. However, in some circumstances the processor will be given more specific, technical duties, especially when it is in the position of extracting and managing the personal data. The contract should list the technical and organisational measures adopted by the processor to enable the assistance. It is crucial to bear in mind that, although \" the practical management of individual requests can be outsourced to the processor, the controller bears the responsibility for complying with such requests. Therefore, the assessment as to whether requests by data subjects are admissible and/or the requirements set by the GDPR are met should be performed by the controller, either on a case-by-case basis or through clear instructions provided to the processor in the contract before the start of the processing .\" [ 48 ] This is not an absolute obligation. The legislature mandates the processor to take every measure to assist the controller, but also clarifies that this should be done \" taking into account the nature of the processing \" and \" insofar as this is possible .\" An example is when an external service company is engaged to handle the destruction of files and data carriers. Due to its inherent nature, the processor can only assist controllers in fulfilling deletion requests. [ 49 ] Under Article 28(3)(f) GDPR, the agreement between the parties or other legal act provides further details as to how the processor should assist the controller in complying with Articles 32 - 36 GDPR . However, the contract or other legal document should not merely repeat what is prescribed by the provision. On the contrary, specific details are needed regarding the specific measures that the processor must adopt to assist the controller. The selection of such measures should be take into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor. In other words, the controller must provide the processor with the necessary elements to understand the processing and provide effective assistance. [ 50 ] \"the processor has, first, a duty to assist the controller in meeting the obligation to adopt adequate technical and organisational measures to ensure security of processing. While this may overlap, to some extent, with the requirement that the processor itself adopts adequate security measures, where the processing operations of the processor fall within the scope of the GDPR, they remain two distinct obligations, since one refers to the processor\u2019s own measures and the other refers to the controller\u2019s. Secondly, the processor must assist the controller in meeting the obligation to notify personal data breaches to the supervisory authority and to data subjects. The processor must notify the controller whenever it discovers a personal data breach affecting the processor\u2019s or a sub-processor\u2019s facilities / IT systems and help the controller in obtaining the information that need to be stated in the report to the supervisory authority.\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR', 7 July 2021 (Version 2.1), margin number 135 et seq. When a data breach occurs ( Articles 33-34 GDPR ), the processor shall notify the controller without undue delay. The EDPB recommends to include in the contract a specific timeframe (e.g. number of hours) by which the processor should notify the controller, as well as a contact point for such notifications, the modality and the minimum content expected by the controller. Moreover, the EDPB notes that the contractual arrangement between the controller and the processor may also include an authorisation and a requirement for the processor to directly notify a data breach in accordance with Articles 33 and 34, but the legal responsibility for the notification remains with the controller. [ 51 ] \" Where necessary and upon request \", the processor must provide assistance in case the controller carries out a Data Protection Impact Assessment ( Article 35 GDPR ) or if a prior consultation before a DPA is needed under Article 36 GDPR . As a result, \" the controller is the one that must take the initiative to perform the data protection impact assessment, not the processor. \" [ 52 ] The purpose of the contractual terms is to guarantee that personal data receives suitable protection after the conclusion of the \"provision of services related to the processing.\" Consequently, it is the responsibility of the controller to determine the actions the processor should take concerning the personal data. The controller can decide whether personal data (including existing copies) shall be deleted or returned after the end of the provision of the processor's services. The wording \" end of the provision of services \" refers to the termination of the relationship between the parties, regardless of the specific reason that led to such an outcome. Consequently, it could be the case that the contract has reached its specified term, or that the purpose of the processing has been achieved, or even that the processing is deemed unlawful by a decision of the competent authority. If the controller chooses that the personal data be deleted, the processor should ensure that the deletion is performed in a secure manner in compliance with Article 32 GDPR. The processor should confirm to the controller that the deletion has been completed in accordance with an agreed timescale and manner. [ 53 ] \"The controller can decide at the beginning whether personal data shall be deleted or returned by specifying it in the contract, through a written communication to be timely sent to the processor. The contract or other legal act should reflect the possibility for the data controller to change the choice made before the end of the provision of services related to the processing. The contract should specify the process for providing such instructions\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR', 7 July 2021 (Version 2.1), margin number 140. The deletion or return of data may be avoided if so required by the laws of the Member States or the European Union. Lastly, it is rightly noted that the processor may retain the data if necessary for the exercise or defense of legal claims. In such cases, however, the processor acts as an independent controller and must therefore operate on the basis of a valid legal basis. [ 54 ] According to general principles, it is the responsibility of the controller to demonstrate that the processing is carried out in compliance with the GDPR. Article 28(3)(h) GDPR enables such a task in case processors are used. According to Article 28(3)(h) GDPR, the processor should provide all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with all the aforementioned obligations to the controller, and allow for as well as contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by the controller or another auditor. [ 55 ] The contract should specify the frequency and method of information exchange between the processor and the controller, ensuring that the controller is fully informed about the processing details necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations outlined in Article 28 of the GDPR. For example, relevant parts of the processor's records of processing activities can be shared with the controller. The processor should provide comprehensive information on how the processing activities will be carried out on behalf of the controller. This information should encompass details about system functionality, security measures, compliance with data retention requirements, data location, data transfers, data access, recipients of data, use of sub-processors, and other relevant aspects. [ 56 ] The contract must also specify the methods through which the processor assists in conducting audits and inspections by the controller or its appointed auditor. These activities enable the controller to verify the processor's compliance with the obligations stated in this Article. The parties should engage in a cooperative manner and evaluate whether and when audits should be conducted at the premises of the processor. They should also determine the appropriate type of audit or inspection (remote, on-site, or alternative methods) based on the specific circumstances, considering security considerations. The controller has the ultimate decision-making authority in this regard. After the inspection results are obtained, the controller should have the ability to request the processor to implement necessary measures, such as addressing identified deficiencies and gaps. [ 57 ] It is advisable to record the results of the inspections carried out by the person responsible so that, if necessary, proof of these can be provided to the supervisory authorities at a later date. The final sentence of Article 28(3) GDPR requires the processor to immediately inform the controller if, in its opinion, an instruction infringes the GDPR or other Union or Member State data protection provisions. After the alert is sent, the controller shall verify whether it is grounded. If the controller confirms the instructions, the processor may carry them out. Nonetheless, this principle does not apply if the controller explicitly demands actions that clearly violate the law or seriously infringe upon personal rights. In such instances, the processor has the right to refuse to carry out the data processing requested by the controller. [ 58 ] \"Once informed that one of its instructions may be in breach of data protection law, the controller will have to assess the situation and determine whether the instruction actually violates data protection law. The EDPB recommends the parties to negotiate and agree in the contract the consequences of the notification of an infringing instruction sent by the processor and in case of inaction from the controller in this context. One example would be to insert a clause on the termination of the contract if the controller persists with an unlawful instruction. Another example would be a clause on the possibility for the processor to suspend the implementation of the affected instruction until the  controller confirms, amends or withdraws its instruction.\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR', 7 July 2021 (Version 2.1), margin number 148 et seq. While Article 28(2) GDPR specifies the conditions under which the processor may engage other processors, Article 28(4) GDPR contains legal consequences of subcontracting. Firstly, this provision stipulates that where a processor engages another processor for carrying out specific processing activities on behalf of the controller, the same data protection obligations as set out in the contract or other legal act between the controller and the processor as referred to in Article 28(3) shall be imposed on that other processor by way of a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law. In particular, this applies to the obligation to provide sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that the processing will meet the requirements of the GDPR. In other words, the (original) processor must conclude a contract or otherwise rely on another legal act with the sub-processor that contains the same obligations as the one concluded between the controller and the processor. Therefore, the sub-processor also has to provide sufficient guarantees that it implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures. The EDPB notes that this \"includes the obligation under Article 28(3)(h) to allow for and contribute to audits by the controller or another auditor mandated by the controller \u201d. [ 59 ] \"[W]hen a processor intends to employ an (authorised) sub-processor, it must enter into a contract with it that imposes the same obligations as those imposed on the first processor by the controller or the obligations must be imposed by another legal act under EU or Member State law. The whole chain of processing activities needs to be regulated by written agreements. Imposing the \u201csame\u201d obligations should be construed in a functional rather than in a formal way: it is not necessary for the contract to include exactly the same words as those used in the contract between the controller and the processor, but it should ensure that the obligations in substance are the same. This also means that if the processor entrusts the sub-processor with a specific part of the processing, to which some of the obligations cannot apply, such obligations should not be included \u201cby default\u201d in the contract with the sub-processor, as this would only generate uncertainty. As an example, as to assistance with data breach related obligations, notification of a data breach by a sub-processor directly to the controller could be done if all three agree. However, in the case of such direct notification the processor should be informed and get a copy of the notification.\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR', 7 July 2021 (Version 2.1), margin number 160. Second, Article 28(4) GDPR stipulates that in case the sub-processor fails to fulfill its data protection obligations, the initial processor shall remain fully liable to the controller for the performance of that other processor's obligations. This means that the (original) processor is liable to the controller for breaches by the sub-processor. The involvement of multiple data processors does not result in a complication of legal protection and liability in this regard. [ 60 ] As stipulated in Article 28(1) GDPR, a controller has to make sure that a processor provides \" sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that processing will meet the requirements of [the GDPR] and ensure the protection of the rights of the data subject. \" According to Article 28(4) GDPR the same is true if a processor wants to engage another processor (see commentary on the respective provisions above). Article 28(5) GDPR gives the processor the option of demonstrating those sufficient guarantees through adherence to an approved code of conduct ( Article 40 GDPR ) or an approved certification mechanism ( Article 42 GDPR ). Whether this adherence is real and has been demonstrated must be decided in each case, taking into account the specific processing, the code of conduct and/or the certification procedure. [ 61 ] Moreover, it should be pointed out that adherence to such systems is only an \u201c element \u201d by which to demonstrate sufficient guarantees. [ 62 ] Thus, an overall assessment of the controller based on all the information and evidence available to them is still required (see Recital 81 sentence 2 GDPR). [ 63 ] Especially if any indications of the processor's unreliability become apparent, the controller has to investigate further and might have to refrain from any cooperation or even terminate an existent agreement. [ 64 ] It would be advisable to contractually oblige the processor to inform the controller about any change regarding the codes of conduct or the certification (e.g. an amendment of the codes of conduct or a re-certification). [ 65 ] This provision could be especially helpful in situations where it is otherwise difficult for a controller to asses a potential processor and when the processor provides very similar services for a large number of controllers, e.g. in the area of cloud computing. [ 66 ] Article 28(6) GDPR introduces the possibility to base the contract or other legal act in whole or in part on standard contractual clauses . This standard contractual clauses can either be laid down by the Commission (see Article 28(7) GDPR) or adopted by a supervisory authority (Article 28(8) GDPR). Of course, this does not exclude the possibility to negotiate an individual contract between a controller and a processor or the possibility to use standard contractual clauses only for parts of the requirements under Article 28(3) and (4) GDPR. [ 67 ] Whichever option is chosen by the controller and processor, the content required in Article 28(3) and (4) GDPR has to be included in the agreement. [ 68 ] Whenever the parties deviate from standard contractual clauses, they should make sure that the requirements in Article 28(3) and (4) GDPR are fulfilled. [ 69 ] Also other legal acts (besides a contract) can (in whole or in part) rely on standard contractual clauses. [ 70 ] This option has the potential to create simple and recognised contractual clauses, especially for largely standardised processes and processing such as cloud, hosting and infrastructure services or also software-as-a-service offerings, which creates a balanced and data protection-friendly framework for controllers, processors, as well as data subjects. [ 71 ] According to this provision, the use of standard contractual clauses can also be considered in connection with an officially recognised certification granted to the controller or processor pursuant to Articles 42 and 43 GDPR . [ 72 ] Common mistake: The standard contractual clauses mentioned in this provision should not be confused with standard data protection clauses adopted by the Commission under Article 46(2)(a) GDPR. There are two ways in which standard contractual clauses can be established. First, according to Article 28(7) GDPR, the Commission can lay them down in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2) GDPR (see commentary on Article 93(2) GDPR ). [ 73 ] And indeed, the Commission has made use of its power under Article 28(7) GDPR and published standard contractual clauses for the first time with the implementing decision dated 4 June 2021. [ 74 ] As mentioned above, this standard contractual clauses, governing the cooperation of a controller and a processor inside the Union, must not be mistaken with the standard data protection clauses under Article 46(2)(a) GDPR which are also adopted by the Commission but which govern data streams outside of the Union. [ 75 ] However, it is plausible that the cooperation between a controller in the Union and a processor in a country for with an adequacy decision under Article 45 GDPR was adopted, could also be based on the standard contractual clauses under this provision. [ 76 ] It is reminded that there is no obligation to use the standard contractual clauses provided by the Commission (or adopted by a SA). However, if controller and processor choose to use standard contractual clauses they should make sure to add the details of the specific situation and not just blindly use the template provided. [ 77 ] In accordance with Article 28(8) GDPR, standard contractual clauses can also be adopted by a SA in accordance with the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63 GDPR . Such standard contractual clauses should be published in the \" EDPB's Register for Decisions taken by supervisory authorities and courts on issues handled in the consistency mechanism \". [ 78 ] Regarding the consistency mechanism mentioned in this provision, Article 64(1)(a) GDPR requires a SA to communicate to the EDPB when it aims to adopt standard contractual clauses. In this case, the EDPB has to issue an opinion (see commentary on Article 64(1)(a) GDPR ). [ 79 ] It should be noted that any templates provided by SAs under any predecessor provision of the GDPR cannot be considered valid any longer. [ 80 ] Article 28(9) GDPR states that the contract (or the other legal act) under Article 28(3) and (4) GDPR has to be in writing. It therefore stipulates a specific form requirement for a processing agreement between a controller and a processor. The provision also clarifies that the 'electronic form' fulfils this requirement without further explaining what can be considered an electronic form. It can be assumed that the electronic form does not require a qualified electronic signature; rather any document (constituting a contract or other legal act) in electronic form will suffice. [ 81 ] Therefore, any agreement between a controller and a processor in a non-written form cannot be considered to meet this requirement. The EDPB further recommends that the signatures of the parties are included in the legal act as well, even though this is not a requirement stipulated in Article 28(9) GDPR. [ 82 ] The processor is not entitled to determine the purposes and means of the processing. This is up to the controller; in fact, this determination is what defines a controller (see Article 4(7) GDPR ). Article 28(10) GDPR prohibits processors from exceeding the scope of the processing agreement and processing data beyond the scope of the processing agreement and, therefore, determine the purposes and means of the processing. In this case a processor is in violation with the GDPR. At the same time, this provision makes clear that the processor should be considered to be a controller for that (unlawful) processing. \"Acting 'on behalf of' also means that the processor may not carry out processing for its own purpose(s). As provided in Article 28(10), a processor infringes the GDPR by going beyond the controller\u2019s instructions and starting to determine its own purposes and means of processing. The processor will be considered a controller in respect of that processing and may be subject to sanctions for going beyond the controller\u2019s instructions\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR', 7 July 2021 (Version 2.1), margin number 81. This provision governs cases where the processor unlawfully exceeds its powers because the power to determine aspects of the processing (i.e. its purpose and means) lies with the controller. [ 83 ] Less clear are cases in which the controller delegates decision-making powers to the processor and the processor acts within this broadened scope. This would still lead to the processor acting as a controller but would - in itself - not be a case of Article 28(10) GDPR. [ 84 ] This provision stipulates that any liability under Articles 82 , 83 and 84 remains unaffected. But the processor loses its privileged status with regard to liability, and is subject to all the obligations of a controller set out in the GDPR.

has access to personal data, shall not process those data except on instructions from the controller, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law. Article 29 GDPR obliges processors (as defined in Article 4(8) GDPR ) and anyone with access to personal data acting under the authority of the controller (as defined in Article 4(7) GDPR ) or processor to only process those data on instructions from the controller, unless required to do otherwise by Union or Member State law. Therefore, this provision establishes an obligation for anybody processing the data on behalf of a controller to follow the controller's instructions in order for the controller will stay the entity which determines the purposes and means of the processing. [ 1 ] This provision applies to both the processor and any person acting under the authority of the controller or of the processor, who has access to personal data. \"Access to personal data\" should be understood as the mere possibility to access the data that is processed on the controller's behalf. It is not necessary that the personal data is actually accessed or otherwise processed by that person. [ 2 ] Regarding the processor as the addressee of this obligation, it should be noted that there are similar and connected obligations in A rticle 28 GDPR (see commentary on Article 28 GDPR ). A main feature of Article 29 GDPR is, however, that every person acting under the authority of the processor is also directly bound by it. This could potentially lead to conflicts when a person under the authority of the processor (e.g. an employee of the processor) receives different instructions from the controller. [ 3 ] Any person acting under the authority of the controller or the processor refers to legal persons as well as to natural persons. [ 4 ] A requirement is that the controller or processor has some authority over the person regarding the processing of personal data on behalf of the controller or processor. Therefore, there must be some legal relationship between the person and the controller or processor. [ 5 ] This is the case for employees of the controller or processor. [ 6 ] \"Employees who have access to personal data within an organisation are generally not considered as 'controllers' or 'processors', but rather as 'persons acting under the authority of the controller or of the processor' within the  meaning of article 29 GDPR\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR', 7 July 2021 (Version 2.1), foot note 9. But people other than employees could also be considered as persons acting under the authority of the controller or the processor. Determinations of this requirement in respect of freelancers, consultants or other relationships with similarities to employees can all prove difficult. The respective assessment should be performed on a case-by-case basis and should, inter alia, consider the independence of the person. [ 7 ] For example: A freelancer provides limited technical support for a company and potentially has access to the personal data of the company's employees while fixing some bugs in the system used by the controller to record its employees' working hours. The company as controller and the freelancer have to asses whether the freelancer should be considered a processor or if it is only a person under the authority of the controller. Therefore they should consider, inter alia, how integrated the freelancer is in the controller's organisation, how the controller's authority over the freelancer (especially regarding data protection) is formulated in the respective agreement and the level of the freelancer's independence in fulfilling his duties. [ 8 ] Regarding persons under the authority of a processor, reference can also be made to Article 28(3)(b) GDPR , which stipulates that a processing agreement has to oblige the processor to ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality (see commentary on Article 28(3)(b) GDPR ). [ 9 ] Article 29 GDPR applies also to sub-processors; in this case, the requirements of Article 28 GDPR have to be considered as well. [ 10 ] In any event, the fact that a person is subject to Article 29 GDPR should not be used as a factor to avoid the conclusion of a processing agreement under Article 28 GDPR. [ 11 ] Article 29 GDPR, together with various other provisions like Article 24 and 28 GDPR , aims at ensuring a clear distribution of responsibilities for the processing of personal data. The controller is the ultimate decision maker and determines the purposes and means of the processing (see Article 4(7) GDPR ). On the other hand, everybody else involved in the processing should follow the controller's instructions and process the data only on the controller's behalf. Otherwise, they themselves would act as controllers; Article 28(10) GDPR specifically stipulates this consequence for processors. [ 12 ] In order to achieve this goal, Article 29 GDPR prohibits any person acting under the authority of the controller or the processor who processes personal data on their behalf from doing so without their instructions. In other words, such persons are bound by the instructions of the controller (or processor). An instruction could be any order to do or refrain from doing something, e.g. regarding the implementation of technical and organisational measures or the performance of a processing activity. Article 29 GDPR does not provide any requirements for these instructions, but considering the potential liability and consequences, it is recommended that the actors document all instructions which should at the same time be sufficiently clear. [ 13 ] Persons under the authority of the controller or processor are generally not obliged to assess the lawfulness of the instruction. [ 14 ] However, a processor is obliged to inform the controller, if it considers that instructions of the controller infringes the GDPR or other laws (see Article 28(3) GDPR ). Arguably, the recipient of an instructions is not bound by it if the instruction is clearly unlawful. [ 15 ] This provision directly obliges its addressees without the need to first contractually agree on this obligation, which is a significant difference to Article\u00a028(3)(a) GDPR . Processors and any other person acting under the authority of the controller (or processor) are therefore directly bound by this provision even if respective contractual clause with the controller or processor was concluded. [ 16 ] Article 29 GDPR provides for an exception to the general rule that personal data can only be processed in accordance with the instructions of the controller. According to this provision, this rule does not apply when a person (including a processor) acting under the authority of the controller or of the processor, is otherwise required by Union or Member State law. This could be the case if a person is legally obliged to provide data to authorities or to archive specific information. Provisions in Union or Member State law that merely allow for the processing are insufficient. [ 17 ] This provision also does not apply to the compliance with obligations that are directed at the controller.

Decisions 5 References 1. This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means and to the processing other than by automated means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system. 2. This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data: 3. For the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 applies. Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and other Union legal acts applicable to such processing of personal data shall be adapted to the principles and rules of this Regulation in accordance with Article 98. 4. This Regulation shall be without prejudice to the application of Directive 2000/31/EC, in particular of the liability rules of intermediary service providers in Articles 12 to 15 of that Directive. Article 2 GDPR sets out the material scope of the GDPR. Paragraph 1 clarifies that the Regulation applies to any processing of personal data by automated means or to the non-automated processing of personal data that is or is intended to be stored in a filing system. Paragraph 2 provides for exemptions that exclude the applicability of the GDPR, such as data processing relating to activities outside the scope of European law or relating to purely personal or domestic activities. Paragraph 3 confirms the validity of sector-specific data protection laws for the processing carried out by European institutions provided that these regulations are brought into compliance with the GDPR. Finally, Paragraph 4 clarifies that the rules of Directive 2000/31/EC are not affected by the provisions of the GDPR. The Regulation applies to any processing of personal data by automated means or to the non-automated processing of personal data that is, or is intended to be, stored in a filing system. The term 'processing' is defined, and further discussed, in Article 4(2) GDPR . In general, processing includes any operation or set of operations performed on personal data. This includes everything from collection to storage and deletion. As long as personal data exists, it is usually also processed. For example: A company is processing information about customers in a digital spread sheet. While the entering of personal data and most use is analogue, the storage in the spread sheet is processing by automated means. The material scope requires the data in question to be 'personal data'. This term is defined, and further discussed, in Article 4(1) GDPR . Any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person falls under the GDPR, this also includes so-called 'pseudonymised data'. However, truly anonymous data and data not relating to a person is not regulated by the GDPR. For example: A company runs two databases. The first database holds information to manage machines in a production plant, there is no information relating to people. The second database holds information on employees. Only the second database falls under the GDPR. The expression 'automated means' is not defined in the GDPR. It should be understood broadly as including all procedures in which at least part of the data processing is carried out automatically. [ 1 ] The data processing must be ' fully ' or 'partially ' automated. The GDPR does not define the type of automation further, and instead takes a technologically neutral approach. A data processing activity is understood as partially automated when it is carried out partly manually and partly automatically. For example, when personal data is manually entered into a digital database, or if several data processing operations, some of which are carried out manually and some of which are automated, are sufficiently closely linked in a logical process. [ 2 ] In practice, this means that any processing of personal data in a digital format must be seen as automated means and usually falls under the GDPR. This gives the GDPR a very wide scope. For example: A company is processing information about customers in a digital spread sheet. While the entering of personal data and most use is analogue, the storage in the spread sheet is processing by automated means. Additionally, the GDPR applies to non-automated processing of personal data if the personal data forms part of a filing system, or is intended for this purpose. In other words, if the data is intended as part of a filing system, but is not processed by automated means, the collection of such data will constitute a processing operation even before it is organized into a filing system. The concept of 'filing system' is defined in Article 4(6) GDPR and consists of any structured set of personal data which are accessible according to specific criteria. For example: A doctor writes health information onto a form. The form is stored in the hospital's old paper filing system, where each patient's papers are stored according to surname and first name of the patient. While paper filing systems are largely replaced by automated systems, they still exist for historic files and in certain contexts, such as the health care system, public registries or legal archives. The GDPR continues to protect personal data in such filing systems, as they were traditionally covered by European data protection laws, such as Directive 95/46/EC. In C-25/17 Jehovan todistajat (also known as 'Jehovah\u2019s Witness') the concept of a \u2018filing system\u2019 under the Directive 95/46/EC has been considered by the CJEU. In this case, the Jehovah\u2019s Witness Community used a form to collect or process personal data in the course of their door-to-door preaching, without adhering to the applicable data protection law. [ 3 ] The processing of the personal data was not carried out by automated means, so the question arose as to whether the data processed formed part of, or was intended to form part of, a filing system. The Court accepted a broad definition of filing system by pointing out that the previous Directive 95/46 (as Article 2(1) GDPR) [ 4 ] does not put down any specific requirement in term of its structure or form. [ 5 ] The Court concluded that the definition of 'filing system' is applicable when data are structured according to specific criteria which, in practice, enable them to be easily retrieved for subsequent use. In order for such a set of data to fall within that concept, it is not necessary that they include data sheets, specific lists or other search methods. [ 6 ] \"The concept of a \u2018filing system\u2019 [...] covers a set of personal data collected in the course of door-to-door preaching, consisting of the names and addresses and other information concerning the persons contacted, if those data are structured according to specific criteria which, in practice, enable them to be easily retrieved for subsequent use. In order for such a set of data to fall within that concept, it is not necessary that they include data sheets, specific lists or other search methods.\" CJEU - C-25/17 - Jehovan todistajat , margin number 62. If the elements in Article 2(1) are fulfilled, the GDPR applies unless the processing falls under one of the exemptions named in Article 2(2)(a) to (d) GDPR. The first category of exemptions relates to processing for activities which fall ' outside the scope of Union law'. [ 7 ] This paragraph is more of a clarification that the EU does not overstep its jurisdiction. The wording is not particularly helpful because it is not immediately apparent what the ' scope of Union law' is. However, this provision has very limited impact in practice, as almost any commercial activity falls within the scope of Union law. One of the main competences of the European Union is to establish an internal market in which, among other things, the free flow of data is guaranteed. It follows that all data processing activities, whether directly or indirectly related to this purpose, are covered under Union law (and therefore excluded from this exemption). As such, processing activities carried out by individuals and companies will almost always be regulated by Union law (insofar as they are useful or instrumental to the internal market) and therefore by the GDPR. Under Article 4(2) TFEU \u201c national security remains the sole responsibility of the individual Member States \u201d. Thus, all activities related to national security, such as data processing by intelligence services, are excluded from the scope of EU law. Recital 16 confirms this interpretation and adds that \u201c the processing of personal data by the Member States when carrying out activities in relation to the common foreign and security policy of the Union \u201d is also excluded from the scope of the Regulation (see subsection (b) below). Article 2(2)(b) excludes the applicability of the GDPR for the processing of personal data carried out by the Member States when performing activities as part of the Union\u2019s common foreign and security policy (see Chapter 2 of Title V of the TEU). More precisely, according to Article 39 TEU, the Council shall adopt a decision laying down the rules relating to the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Member States when carrying out such activities. These rules have not yet been adopted. However, Articles 7 (respect for private and family life) and 8 (data protection) of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights remain applicable. [ 8 ] Article 2(2)(c) GDPR reaffirms the so-called 'household exemption' which already existed under Directive EC/95/46. According to this provision, the GDPR does not apply where processing is carried out by a natural person for purely personal or household activities, where they would otherwise be controllers and would have to fully comply with the GDPR. As private individuals engage in more and more data processing operations, this exception becomes increasingly relevant. On the one hand an individual publishing information online became a rather common phenomenon - on the other hand it may be more damaging to have personal details exposed on a popular platform than to have it stored in a rather irrelevant commercial database. Given that everyone has a fundamental right to privacy and data protection under Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter, the European legislator has chosen a rather narrow exemption for private individuals. In order for the exemption to apply, it is essential that the processing be performed by a 'natural person'. Thus, processing by legal entities, whatever legal form they may have (including NGOs, Foundations, Trusts and alike), is not covered by the exemption and remains subject to the GDPR, even if they do not pursue any commercial interest. [ 9 ] The GDPR does not provide a specific definition of 'personal' and 'household' activities. The definition is clearly narrower than the European 'consumer' definition, hence consumers can be controllers or processors that have to fully comply with the GDPR, if they process personal data beyond a purely personal or household activity. In addition to personal activities a household activity may allow processing that goes beyond one individual, such as a commonly used computer or software within a household. Different factors to distinguish the 'private' from the 'non-private' can be drawn out from the existing case-law: According to the CJEU in C-25/17 Jehovan todistajat (also known as 'Jehovah\u2019s Witness'), these requirements must be interpreted as covering only activities that are carried out in the context of the private or family life of individuals. \"[A]n activity cannot be regarded as being purely personal or domestic where its purpose is to make the data collected accessible to an unrestricted number of people or where that activity extends,even partially, to a public space and is accordingly directed outwards from the private setting of the person processing the data in that manner [...]\". CJEU - C-25/17 - Jehovan todistajat , margin number 42 with further references. According to C-101/01, Bodil Lindqvist , the publication of personal data on a blogging site made available to an unlimited number of people would obviously not be subject to the household exemption. [ 10 ] That exception [for the processing of data carried out by a natural person in the exercise of activities which are exclusively personal or domestic] must therefore be interpreted as relating only to activities which are carried out in the course of private or family life of individuals, which is clearly not the case with the processing of personal data consisting in publication on the internet so that those data are made accessible to an indefinite number of people.\" CJEU - C-101/01 - Lindqvist , margin number 47. This interpretation was confirmed by the Court in C-212/12 Ryne\u0161 , where it took a narrow view of the exemption. Indeed, a camera system installed on a family home for the purposes of protecting the property was not considered to fall under the exemption insofar as it also recorded a public space. [ 11 ] \"To the extent that video surveillance such as that at issue in the main proceedings covers, even partially, a public space and is accordingly directed outwards from the private setting of the person processing the data in that manner, it cannot be regarded as an activity which is a purely \u2018personal or household\u2019 activity [,,,]\". CJEU - C-212/13 - Ryne\u0161 , margin number 33. In addition, Recital 18 provides some examples of exempted activities such as: personal correspondence, keeping of addresses, or social networking and online activity as long as they are purely personal or a household activity. The reference to social networks as a type of activity exempted from the GDPR seems to slightly depart from previous case law of the CJEU in C-101/01, Bodil Lindqvist [ 12 ] and seems to indicate that sharing of information with a limited number of close friends can still be seen as a purely personal activity. This would reflect today's reality on various online platforms to a certain extent. In practice, there seem to be three main criteria that can help in the assessment: First, one has to assess the space of the processing. Activities that take place in a private space can be considered 'personal'. Public places or generally available websites are excluded from the application of the household exemption. Second, the social aspect of the processing is relevant. One needs to review the relationship between the natural person who carries out the processing and the data subjects and the extent of the group of subjects who have access to the personal data. Third, one has to determine the purpose pursued by the controller. According to Recital 18, these activities must have no connection with anything 'professional' or 'economic'. Consequently, if the activities pursue such purposes, the exemption will not apply. By applying the aforementioned criteria, scholars have convincingly argued that the number of potential recipients of personal data should be verified in order to apply the exemption. Interpreted in this way, the GDPR would not apply to processing operations concerning social network use when they involve a limited number of recipients or readers. Conversely, if the processing or message is available to an indeterminate number of people, the household exemption will not apply. [ 13 ] Recital 18 also clarifies that exemptions under Article 2(2) GDPR do not extend to controllers or processors that provide the means for purely personal or household processing. It seems equally obvious that a social network would not be exempt from the GDPR, just because some users may fall under the household exemption. For example: A user processed her private phone book in a cloud drive to sync it across devices. She has a shared calendar, that is also used by other family members. She is exempt from the GDPR under the household exemption. The commercial provider of the cloud drive still falls under the GDPR. The prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences, the execution of criminal penalties and the prevention of threats to public security describes the broad area of criminal law, public order and security laws. Processing of personal data in this area is exempt from the GDPR. The exemption is however limited to competent authorities under national law. When the GDPR was implemented the parallel Law Enforcement Directive (EU) 2016/680 was passed and to regulate this subject matter. The Directive has to be implemented in national law of each Member State. In many cases, Member States choose to have a single law to implement aspects of the GDPR and the Law Enforcement Directive. Article 3(2) of the previous Directive 95/46/EG already exempted the rather sensitive area of criminal law from the application. For example: The use of CCTV to prevent thefts by a shop owner is covered by the GDPR. The further use of CCTV data by the police after a robbery is regulated by the Law Enforcement Directive as transposed in national law. Where data is processed by EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 applies. Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data ('EUDPR') revises Regulation (EC) No. 45/2001 to align it with the GDPR. Chapter IX of the EUDPR outlines general rules on data protection applicable to EU law enforcement activities within the scope of Chapter 2 of Title V of the TFEU. The European Data Protection Supervisor (\"EDPS\") is the relevant supervisory authority for EU institutions. The GDPR applies without prejudice to the application of the e-Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC . Specific reference is made to Articles 12 to 15 e-Commerce Directive, which concern the liability of intermediary service providers in situations where they merely transmit information, \u2018cache\u2019 information, or merely store information. Intermediary services still fall under the GDPR for their own processing, but are generally not liable for information that passes their systems. As this is a general rule, this seems to be a mere clarification. On 17 February 2024, Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 (the 'Digital Servies Act') replaced parts of the e-Commerce Directive. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 2 GDPR \u2191 B\u00e4cker, in Wolff, Brink, BeckOK Datenschutzrecht, Article 2 GDPR, margin number 2 (C.H.

Each controller and, where applicable, the controller's representative, shall maintain a record of processing activities under its responsibility. That record shall contain all of the following information: 2.   Each processor and, where applicable, the processor's representative shall maintain a record of all categories of processing activities carried out on behalf of a controller, containing: 3.   The records referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be in writing, including in electronic form. 4.   The controller or the processor and, where applicable, the controller's or the processor's representative, shall make the record available to the supervisory authority on request. 5.   The obligations referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to an enterprise or an organisation employing fewer than 250 persons unless the processing it carries out is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, the processing is not occasional, or the processing includes special categories of data as referred to in Article 9(1) or personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10. Article 30 GDPR requires controllers and processors to maintain a record of processing activities . This obligation replaces the old notification obligation where data processing activities had to be notified to Supervisory Authorities (\"SA\") [ 1 ] and represents the expression of several data processing principles. On the one hand, it promotes accountability by allowing the controller to keep track of its processing and amend it where necessary. It is thus an important tool for complying with various obligations of the controller (e.g. Information obligations under Article 13 and 14 GDPR ) rights of data subjects (e.g. Right of access under Article 15 GDPR ). [ 2 ] On the other hand, it increases the overall transparency of the processing and makes it easier for SAs to roughly assess the lawfulness of processing activities. [ 3 ] In practice, the record of processing activities is an updated written account of the main elements of the processing. Paragraph 1 of this provision specifies the information that the controller must include in the record of processing activities. Paragraph 2 serves the same purpose, but it is addressed to the processor. Paragraph 3 clarifies that the record must be in written form, possibly also in electronic form. The following paragraph, paragraph 4, states that the record must be provided to supervisory authorities when they request it. Finally, the last paragraph establishes exceptions to the obligation to keep the record for controllers and processors with fewer than 250 employees, unless additional conditions are met. The addressee of the obligation to maintain a record of processing activities is mainly the controller (as defined in Article 4(7) GDPR ). However, in case a controller is not established in the Union, the obligation applies to controller's representatives. [ 4 ] In case of a processing activity under joint controllership, it is argued that it is sufficient that only one controller maintains the record of processing activities. This must be stipulated in the joint controllership agreement (see Article 26 GDPR ) otherwise each controller is obliged to maintain the respective record. However, each controller is responsible for the record of processing activities and has to provide it to a SA if necessary. [ 5 ] In a group of companies, each controller has to maintain its own record of processing activities. [ 6 ] Common mistake: The holding company of a group of companies - each of which is a separate controller for a number of processing activities - maintains one record of processing activities for all group companies. Such a practice would be unlawful since the responsibility to maintain a record of processing activities lies with each separate controller. Internally, the controller's (or representative's) management has to ensure that the respective obligation is fulfilled. While the data protection officer (\"DPO\") might support and consult, maintaining the record of processing activities is not one of its duties under Article 39 GDPR and could lead to a conflict of interest. [ 7 ] EDPB : WP29, 'Position Paper on the derogations from the obligation to maintain records of processing activities pursuant to Article 30(5) GDPR', 19 April 2018 (available here ). This provision establishes the controller's (or its representative's) obligation to maintain a record of processing activities under its responsibility. This will generally be a written document encompassing all the processing activities performed by a controller, regardless of whether the controller performs the processing itself or uses processors. The term \"processing activity\" does not refer to the definition of \"processing\" in Article 4(2) GDPR which encompasses any operation which is performed on personal data. Rather, a \"processing activity\" can be understood as the sum of all data processing operations (each a processing under Article 4(2) GDPR ) carried out to achieve a specified purpose. [ 8 ] This level could be equal or similar to a business process but should be specific enough to make it possible to reasonably assess the lawfulness of the processing activity. [ 9 ] For example: A website provider has to verify the age of users and does so by a asking for users dates of birth, calculating their age and later deleting the information collected from data subjects. While the collection, calculation and deletion would each be a processing under Article 4(2) GDPR, the processing activity which needs to be recorded in the record of processing activities under Article 30 GDPR would be the whole age verification. Only on this level it is possible to assess whether the processing operation might be lawful or the security measures might be sufficient. The record of processing activities has be maintained . It is not sufficient to prepare the record of processing activity just once. Similarly it is insufficient to include each processing activity only with the information available at the implementation of the processing activity. Rather, the record of processing actives should reflect the current state of the processing activities. Regular updates are therefore strictly necessary. [ 10 ] Article 30(1) GDPR provides a list of the elements that must be contained in the record of processing activities carried out by the controller. If the controller is located outside the EU, then its representative in the EU under Article 27 GDPR is subject to this obligation. However, the controller could add additional information to the record of processing activities. This could be advisable if the controller wants to further improve the record of processing activities value for assessing the lawfulness of processing activities and the fulfilment of other obligations. [ 11 ] Article 30(1)(a) GDPR states it should contain the name and contact details of the controller and, where applicable, the joint controller(s), [ 12 ] the controller's representative and the data protection officer. In case of joint controllership, it is necessary to list the names and contact details of all joint controllers. [ 13 ] This information is intended to enable an unambiguous identification of the controller(s) and whoever else is responsible under the GDPR. The notion of 'contact details' is not limited to a simple email address. It must contain all the elements (physical address, telephone number, contact person)\u00a0that make it possible to contact a particular person or, where appropriate, reach them for an inspection. [ 14 ] Article 30(1)(b) GDPR requires the controller to provide a description of the purposes of the processing. In accordance with Article 5(2)(b) GDPR , purposes must be determined prior to the data collection and, in principle, subsequent processing is only allowed for such pre-specified purposes, which must be clear and transparent to enable the supervisory authority to assess the adequacy of safeguards implemented and the lawfulness of the processing during potential audits. [ 15 ] Speaking of lawfulness, the provision does not require to mention the legal basis upon which a certain purpose relies. This gap should be filled by interpreting the text in line with the principle of accountability. If a controller must demonstrate compliance with the GDPR, then it must have a \" firm and reasoned notion about the legal basis of processing before it starts any operation, and this notion should be verifiable by means of its records. Thus, in order for the keeping of records to be meaningful, it will be necessary for the controller to be able to demonstrate on which legal basis it relies in its processing \". [ 16 ] Article 30(1)(c) GDPR establishes that the record of processing activities shall describe the categories of data subjects and the categories of personal data. Examples of categories of data subjects are \"website visitors\", \"clinic patients\", \"employees\". Categories of personal data may be \"website clicks\", \"diagnosis\", \"holiday leave\", as well as \"union affiliations\". The list of categories should make it sufficiently clear whether special categories of personal data under Article 9 GDPR or personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences under Article 10 GDPR are processed. [ 17 ] Each category of personal data should be tied to the category of data subject it belongs to. For example, the record of processing activities should clearly show that the two categories \"holiday leave\" and \"union affiliations\" are processed with regard to the \"employees\" category. Article 30(1)(d) GDPR prescribes that controllers should describe the categories of recipients to whom personal data have been or will be disclosed. The wording of the provision suggests that only the categories of addressees have to be indicated, such as \" suppliers \", \" accountants \", \" marketing consultants \", or \" legal advisors \". However, this ambiguity does not seem advisable, as other provisions of the GDPR require the controller to keep track of individual recipients. For example, Article 15(1)(c) GDPR and Article 19 GDPR require the disclosure of \u201c recipients or categories of recipients \u201d and specific recipients \u201c if the data subject requests it \u201d respectively. Based on the same logical and legal premises, the CJEU has recently clarified that, if requested by the data subject, the controller is obliged to provide a specific list of recipients. [ 18 ] As such, it would go against its aim of increasing accountability not to specify the recipients in the record of processing activities. [ 19 ] In accordance with Article 30(1)(e) GDPR, the controller shall provide information regarding the transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation and, in the case of the applicability of Article 49(1) GDPR , the documentation of suitable safeguards. There is no obligation to name the means by which the controller intends to ensure an adequate level of protection on the part of the foreign recipient of the data. Additional information \"is needed only if a data transfer shall, exceptionally, be based on Article 49(1), second subparagraph, which pertains to occasional ('non-repetitive') transfers of data about a limited number of data subjects and for compelling legitimate interests \". [ 20 ] Article 30(1)(f) GDPR requires controllers to clarify the envisaged time limits for erasure of different categories of data. If the controller knows when certain data will be deleted, it is necessary to indicate this period. However, it may not be feasible to specify an exact deletion period for every processing, especially if the permissible storage duration is contingent upon the indefinite duration of a contract. In such cases, it is advisable to provide a general deadline for deletion. Specifying the deletion period also helps the supervisory authority ensure compliance with the requirements of data minimisation ( Article 5(1)(c) GDPR ) and storage limitation ( Article 5(1)(e) GDPR ). [ 21 ] Under Article 30(1)(f) GDPR, where possible, the controller provides a \" general description \" of the technical and organisational security measures referred to in Article 32(1) GDPR . Controller will likely use categories of measures such as \"use of anti-virus programs,\" \"restriction of external access\", \"security guards at the facility\" or similar. However, if the controller engages in numerous processing activities, it can result in a significant documentation effort. [ 22 ] The listed security measures should make it possible for the controller (as well as for a SA) to assess if the implemented technical and organisational security measures seem appropriate and sufficient for the processing activity. [ 23 ] Therefore, the record of processing activities could be a viable place to collect information about the risk assessment the controller hast to perform due to various provisions (Articles 5(1) , 24 , 25 , 32 GDPR). In any case, it is recommended to document the outcome of the risk assessment(s) in the record of processing activities. [ 24 ] Article 30(2) GDPR obliges a processor to maintain a separate record of all categories of processing activities besides the record that is already kept by the controller under Article 30(1) GDPR. In case the processor is not established in the Union, the processor's representative is obliged to maintain a record of processing activities (see commentary on Article 27 GDPR ). The record of all categories of processing activities is commonly also referred to as record of processing activities. Regarding groups of companies and the position of the DPO see commentary on Article 30(1) GDPR above. While a controller has to maintain a record of all categories of processing activities, the processor's (or its representative) obligation refers to a record of all categories of processing activities. Accordingly, the level of detail of the record maintained by the processor can be lower. [ 25 ] Regarding the terms \"maintain\" and \"processing activity\" see the commentary to the controller's parallel obligation under Article 30(1) GDPR above. It should be highlighted that the record of all categories of processing activities under Article 30(2) GDPR is and should be documented separately from the record of processing activities under Article 30(1) GDPR. The record under Article 30(2) GDPR should only include processing activities performed as a processor, i.e. on behalf of the controller. This is another opportunity to carefully assess the data protection roles for each processing activity. Therefore, entities that perform processing activities on behalf of controllers (i.e. processors) will generally have to maintain two records of processing activities. One for the processing activities for which they are a controller and one for the processing activities for which they are a processor. This emphasizes the severe difference between its data protection role in connection with the different processing activities. [ 26 ] Article 30(2) GDPR regulates the minimum requirements of the processor's records of processing activities (or, where available, its representative's under Article 27 GDPR ). These rules, which partly overlap with those established by Article 30(1) GDPR, notably provide for an obligation on the processor to record the following elements. Under Article 30(2)(a) GDPR, similarly to the controller's requirement under Article 30(1)(a) GDPR, the processor must record the name and contact details of the processor or processors. In addition, the processor should indicate the name as well as the contact details of all the controllers (or their representatives) on whose behalf they operate. The later requirement may presents significant challenges for processors engaged in large-scale businesses such as cloud service providers, hosting providers, or software-as-a-service platforms, as they frequently work with thousands or even hundreds of thousands of controllers. [ 27 ] Therefore, it is argued that it should be sufficient to record the category of controllers on behalf of which the processing takes place and provide a SA a full list only on demand. [ 28 ] However, a processor should at all time know for for which controller a processing activity is performed. This provision further requires that the name and contact details of the data protection officer is included. This obligation refers to the processors data protection officer (if one is appointed), and not the data protection officer of the controllers. [ 29 ] Article 30(2)(b) GDPR requires the processor to list the categories of processing carried out on behalf of each controller. The processor is only required to document the categories of processing. The notion of categories implies (similar to the term \"processing activity\") that individual processing operations are not described in detail. It is likely sufficient for the processor to provide a general description of their service in the documentation (such as cloud computing or software-as-a-service). [ 30 ] Where applicable, information on the transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation and, in the case of the applicability of Article 49(1) GDPR , the documentation of suitable safeguards (Article 30(2)(c) GDPR). See commentary under Article 30(1)(e) GDPR. The processor's record of processing activities must contain a general description of the technical and organisational security measures referred to in Article 32(1) GDPR . See commentary under Article 30(1)(g) GDPR. The records of processing activities shall be in writing, including in electronic form. [ 31 ] Generally, it will be more practical to maintain the record of processing activities in an electronic format. While this provision does not make any specifications on the used format, it is required that it is possible to export a the record of processing activities as a text document. [ 32 ] This enables controllers to provide SAs with the records when requested under Article 30(4) GDPR. A usable format of the record of processing activities is also required to comply with, inter alia , the principles of accountability and transparency. Article 30(3) GDPR does not specify the language in which the record of processing activities has to be maintained. However, controllers or processors will regularly be required to provide SAs with documents in the respective national language. [ 33 ] Any changes to the processing operation should be transparent and traceable (e.g. who has been the controller, processor or data protection officer \u2013 and when). Such a history of amendments should be logged for reasonable amount of time. [ 34 ] Under Article 30(4) GDPR, the controller or the processor and, where applicable, the controller's or the processor's representative, shall make the record available to the SA on request. SAs can investigate controllers and processor as general control measure, but also where data breaches have occurred and data subjects have filed complaints. Records of processing activities therefore have to be available, at any time, to be provided to SAs upon request. Although not explicitly stated in Article 30(4) GDPR, the record of processing activity should also be made available to the DPO. Otherwise, the DPO may not have the necessary resources to carry out their duties, as provided for in Article 38(2) of the GDPR. There is no obligation to provide the record of processing activities directly to third parties, including data subjects. However, a significant portion of the information contained in the record of processing activities is already available in privacy policies ( Articles 13 and 14 GDPR ) or in response to access requests ( Article 15 GDPR ). In this regard, it should be noted that the record of processing activities may contain additional information or be voluntarily documented in greater detail (particularly if it serves as a compliance tool), and it might also include trade secrets (such as technical and organizational measures implemented). [ 35 ] Article 32(5) GDPR provides for an exemption from the obligation to maintain a record of processing activities for small actors. At the same time this provision also provides exceptions from the exception, i.e. situations in which also small actors have to maintain a record of processing activities. Accordingly, an enterprise or an organisation employing less than 250 persons is not obliged to maintain records of processing. Relevant is the total number of employees, not just the employees engaged in the processing of personal data. [ 36 ] The aim of the exception is to release small companies from a disproportionate bureaucratic burden. [ 37 ] However, this exception does not apply if (at least) one of the conditions described below apply. The wording of Article 30(5) GDPR is clear in providing that these three types of processing to which the derogation does not apply (the exemptions from the exemption) are alternative and the occurrence of any one of them alone triggers the obligation to maintain the record of processing activities. [ 38 ] It could reasonably be argued that in case a small enterprise or organisation is obligated to maintain a record of processing activities due to the applicability of one of the three cases below, this obligation refers only to the type of processing mentioned in Article 30(5) GDPR. [ 39 ] However, it is still subject to debate, whether the application of one of the three cases would oblige the enterprise or organisation to maintain a record of processing activities covering all of its processing activities. [ 40 ] Since almost any enterprise or organisation has at least one processing activity that is not occasional (especially if it has some employees), the remaining scope of the application would be very small in the later interpretation. Due to this uncertainty and the record of processing activities' potential benefits in the data protection governance, it can be generally recommended to maintain some kine of record of processing activities even if the obligation does not directly apply. Even an enterprise or an organisation with less than 250 employees has to maintain a record of processing activities, if the processing it carries out is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. It is unclear, how the this provision should be interpreted since it could be argued that the processing of personal data is always connected to some risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects (however small). This would mean that the provision would lack any area of applicability. Therefore, the provision is commonly interpreted in referring to a risk that exceeds the risk inherent to any processing of personal data. [ 41 ] Small enterprises or organisations also have to maintain a record of processing activities in case the processing is not occasional . This means that the obligation to maintain a record of processing activities applies for all processing activities that are continuous or systematic. [ 42 ] For example: The processing of personal data by a small company in course of its human resources management is continuous and systematic and therefore not occasional. The company has to maintain a record of the processing activity.

supervisory authority in the performance of its tasks. Article 31 GDPR obliges controllers, processors, and their representatives to cooperate with the supervisory authority (\"SA\"). The purpose of this provision is to facilitate the SA\u2019s fulfilment of its duties under the GDPR. Article\u00a031\u00a0GDPR can be categorised as a largely declaratory provision, as the relationship between controllers, processors and their representatives on the one hand and the supervisory authorities on the other is regulated in more detail in several other provisions of the GDPR. [ 1 ] Consequently, Article\u00a031\u00a0GDPR can mainly be read as a supporting provision to Articles 57 and 58\u00a0GDPR , which outlines the tasks and powers of the SA and establishes a corresponding obligation upon controllers and processors to cooperate (e.g. Article 58(1)(f) GDPR grants a supervisory authority the power to obtain access to the premises of the controller and / or processor). It should be noted that the obligation to cooperate only applies in relation to the SA's performance of its tasks. [ 2 ] Addressees of the obligation to cooperate with the SA are controllers ( Article 4(7) GDPR ), processors ( Article 4(8) GDPR ), and, where applicable, their representatives ( Article 4(17) GDPR ). See the commentary on the respective provision for more information on each of those actors. In situations with various different actors in connection to a processing activity (e.g. a controller and its processor), these actors should agree on how to coordinate in case the SA requests their cooperation (e.g. in the processing agreement under Article 28 GDPR ). [ 3 ] While the data protection officer (if appointed) is not directly subject to this provision, Article 39(1)(d) GDPR provides for a similar obligation for them. Article 31 GDPR provides for a general duty of controllers, processors and their representatives to cooperate with the SA. However, this obligation is subject to a request from the SA, as highlighted by the provision's wording (\"on request\"). [ 4 ] This distinguishes this obligation from other provisions of the GDPR which necessitate proactive action on the part of the controller or processor, for instance, Articles 33 and 36 GDRP . [ 5 ] To illustrate, Article 36\u00a0GDPR obliges the controller to consult the competent SA, where the controller considers the processing to be high risk and has not adopted mitigating measures to reduce the risk. Therefore, Article 36\u00a0GDPR places a cooperative burden upon the controller without the SA having to take prior action, as the controller is obliged to assess the nature of its processing activities, and in the event that they are high risk and the controller cannot mitigate this risk, the controller must then consult the SA. Article 31\u00a0GDPR stands in opposition to such obligations since it requires a prior action of the SA. Hence, Article 31\u00a0GDPR can be said to impose a general duty of cooperation which arises when a request is made by a supervisory authority that relates to the fulfilment of its tasks. Since a failure to cooperate with the SA can be subject to a fine under Article 83(4)(a) GDPR , the SA's request should be sufficiently clear and precise in order to enable the receiver of the request to comply with it. [ 6 ] The request should also include an appropriate deadline to comply. [ 7 ] In this regard, Article 31 GDPR must be read in line with Articles 57 and 58 GDPR . Article\u00a057\u00a0GDPR outlines the extensive tasks afforded to SAs, while Article\u00a058\u00a0GDPR establishes the correspondingly extensive investigative powers granted to SAs under the GDPR. The wording of the provision clearly notes that the SA\u2019s request is to further the performance of its tasks. Following from this, the content and scope of a supervisory authority\u2019s request is constricted by Article\u00a057\u00a0GDPR , which exhaustively lists its tasks. Therefore, the request must be formulated precisely in relation to the fulfilment of a SA\u2019s tasks, subject to the principle of proportionality. [ 8 ] A request that falls outside the scope of Article 57\u00a0GDPR should be deemed inadmissible for the purposes of Article\u00a031\u00a0GDPR. [ 9 ] The fact that the SA's request must be related to its tasks under Articles 57 GDPR does not mean that there must be a specific reason or initial suspicion by the SA in order to make a request. [ 10 ] Article 31\u00a0GDPR can also be read as a supporting provision to the SA's powers under Article 58\u00a0GDPR . However, it is generally accepted that the SA's powers also directly oblige the controller, processor or representative without the need of another provision providing for such obligation. Additionally, SAs already have options to enforce any failure on the part of the controller, processor or representative. [ 11 ] In practice, this means that when a SA uses its powers under Article 58\u00a0GDPR (e.g. orders a controller to provide information it requires for the performance of its task - Article 58(1)(a)\u00a0GDPR ) the controller's obligation to comply arises directly from Article 58\u00a0GDPR. However, Article 31 GDPR provides for a parallel obligation to cooperate. It is subject to dispute, if Article 31 GDPR can even broaden the scope of the cooperation in the sense of imposing administrative procedural cooperative burdens. [ 12 ] This reading of Article 31\u00a0GDPR is supported by the language of Article 83(4)(a)\u00a0GDPR which categorises Article\u00a031\u00a0GDPR as an ' obligation ' of the controller and processor. According to this view, in addition to imposing a general duty of cooperation, Article 31\u00a0GDPR also acts as a ' gap filling ' provision for Article 58\u00a0GDPR. In particular, where the supervisory authority requires a controller or processor to take an action, which is not included within its powers to make an order for under Article 58\u00a0GDPR, it may rely on Article 31\u00a0GDPR to do so. The SA should make it clear if it requests the cooperation under Article 31 GDPR, Article 58 GDPR or another provision. [ 13 ] In practice, this reading suggests that a request made solely under Article 31\u00a0GDPR would be of the same binding nature as an order made by a supervisory authority in the exercise of its powers under Article 58\u00a0GDPR . [ 14 ] For example: A SA receives a complaint by a data subject claiming a violation of their right to erasure under Article 17 GDPR. The SA is in accordance with Article 57(1)(f) GDPR tasked with the handling of the complaint. In the course of the complaint procedure it asks the controller to give a statement and provide relevant information. If the controller fails to respond, it could be considered a violation of Article 31 GDPR. Article 31 GDPR obliges a controller, processor, and representative to cooperate with a request by the SA. The cooperation could refer to an active behaviour (disclosure of documents) or the tolerance of an action by the SA (provide the SA access to the a premise). [ 15 ] This is not the case if the SA asks for a voluntary cooperation. [ 16 ] The cooperation will often take place via a data protection officer (if appointed) in accordance with Article 39(1)(d) GDPR . [ 17 ] Is is subject to debate, whether recipients of a request by a SA can avoid to fully comply with the request in order to protect their interests. For instance, if documents that are subject to business secrets can be redacted. [ 18 ] Further, Article 31 GDPR is surrounded by the question whether a controller, processor, or representative might lawfully refuse to cooperate with a request made by the SA. In other words, the question where the duty to cooperate find its limits in light of the the right against self-incrimination. [ 19 ] The right against self-incrimination stems from Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (' ECHR ') and is found in Union law under Article\u00a047 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights ( 'the Charter') . This privilege does not protect against the making of an incriminating statement, but rather protects against the obtaining of evidence by coercion or threat of sanction. Infringements of the GDPR and the sanctions issued in response to any such infringements often have the capacity to be criminal in nature. Thus, in certain circumstances, GDPR infringements may give rise to the applicability of this right, as Member States are permitted to legislate criminal sanctions for infringements of the GDPR (Recital 149). Consequently, in certain jurisdictions infringements of the GDPR may give rise to criminal liability. Moreover, the imposition of a significant fine (or the threat of such a fine) may equally give rise to the right against self-incrimination. Article 31 GDPR gains an independent significance as it is included in the GDPR\u2019s sanctions framework through Article\u00a083(4)\u00a0GDPR. [ 20 ] Article 83(4) GDPR provides that the infringement of Article 31 GDPR may be subject to administrative fines up to \u20ac10 million, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 2% of the total worldwide annual turnover. CJEU case law demonstrates that administrative fines may be considered criminal if they serve a punitive purpose and have a high degree of severity, regardless of the fine\u2019s classification as administrative under national legislation. [ 21 ] Therefore, if a request made under Article\u00a031\u00a0GDPR gives rise to circumstances which invoke the right against self-incrimination, it is widely accepted by commentators that the right against self-incrimination takes precedence. [ 22 ] Commentators have suggested that the practical application of this reading would mean that Article 31 GDPR cannot be invoked by a SA to induce a controller or processor to make an admission which would give rise to criminal liability, instead a supervisory authority must use its own investigative powers to establish facts which are incumbent on itself to prove. [ 23 ] While the CJEU has yet to rule on the interaction between Article 31 GDPR and the right against self-incrimination, similar lines of reasoning were taken by the Court in relation to the duty to cooperate in the context of competition law. [ 24 ] The leading case in this regard, Orkem, establishes that: \"[W]hile the Commission is entitled [. . .] to compel an undertaking to provide all necessary information concerning such facts as may be known to it and to disclose to it, if necessary, such documents relating thereto as are in its possession, even if the latter may be used to establish against it or an-other undertaking, the existence of anti-competitive conduct, it may not, by means of a decision calling for information, undermine the rights of defence of the undertaking concerned. Thus, the Commission may not compel an undertaking to provide it with answers which might involve an admission on its part of the existence of an infringement which it is incumbent on the Commission to prove.\" [ [1] ], margin number 34 et seq. It is debatable whether the Court would interpret the interaction between Article 31 GDPR and the right against self-incrimination along the same lines as in Orkem . Nonetheless, under European Union law, any reading of legislative acts of the European Union must respect the fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Charter, as they constitute general principles of Union law (Article\u00a06(3) Treaty on the European Union). Therefore, the restriction of the duty to cooperate under Article 31 GDPR by the right against self-incrimination is not in question; however, what is in question is the precise degree to which the duty is restricted once the right against self-incrimination arises. Beneficiary of this provision is the SA ( Article 4(21) GDPR ) which is enabled to request controllers, processors and, where applicable, their representatives to cooperate for the performance of the SA's tasks. For more information on the SA see commentary on Articles 4(21) and 51 . Only the competent SA can invoke Article 31 GDPR and request cooperation from the controller, processor and representative.

Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia as appropriate: 2.   In assessing the appropriate level of security account shall be taken in particular of the risks that are presented by processing, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed. 3.   Adherence to an approved code of conduct as referred to in Article 40 or an approved certification mechanism as referred to in Article 42 may be used as an element by which to demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out in paragraph 1 of this Article. 4.   The controller and processor shall take steps to ensure that any natural person acting under the authority of the controller or the processor who has access to personal data does not process them except on instructions from the controller, unless he or she is required to do so by Union or Member State law. Article 32 GDPR provides for an obligation to implement technical and organisational measures (\"TOMs\") ensuring the security of processing, which is an integral part of the right to data protection under Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (\" CFR \"). [ 1 ] Therefore, this provision reflects the principle of integrity and confidentiality enshrined in Article 5(1)(f) GDPR . Any breach of the security of personal data demanded by this provision leads to a 'personal data breach' as defined in Article 4(12) GDPR and might be subject to a notice to the supervisory authority (\"SA\") or to the data subject (see Articles 33 and 34 GDPR respectively). [ 2 ] Since this provision deals with the implementation of appropriate TOMs, it is closely related to Articles 24 (Responsibility of the controller) and 25 (Data protection by design and by default) GDPR which similarly demand the implementation of appropriate TOMs. However, other than these provisions, Article 32 GDPR addresses controllers as well as processors. Article 32(1) GDPR obliges the controller and the processor to implement appropriate TOMs in order to realise an appropriate level of security, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs as well as the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing. Consideration must also be given to the processing operation\u2019s impact on the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Article 32(2) GDPR lists some specific risks that should be considered in the assessment of the appropriate level of security, such as risks from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to personal data. Article 32(3) GDPR provides for the possibility to use adherence to approved codes of conduct (Article 40 GDPR) or an approved certification mechanism (Article 42 GDPR) as an element to demonstrate compliance with the obligation to implement appropriate security measures. Article 32(4) GDPR obliges controllers and processors to ensure than all persons under their authority with access to personal data do not process them except on instructions from the controller or when it is required by law. EDPB and WP29 Guidelines: EDPB, 'Guidelines 01/2021 on Examples regarding Personal Data Breach Notification', 14 December 2021 (Version 2.0) (available here ). EDPB, 'Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR', 7 July 2021 (Version 2.1) (available here ), WP29, 'Opinion 3/2010 on the principle of accountability', 00062/10/EN WP173, 13 July 2010 (available here ), WP29, 'Guidelines on Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and determining whether processing is \u201clikely to result in a high risk\u201d for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679' 17/EN WP248 rev.01, 4 April 2017 (available here ). Article 32(1) GDPR requires controllers and processors to implement TOMs that ensure an appropriate level of security. The security of personal data is a requirement and core principle ( Article 5(1)(f) GDPR - integrity and confidentiality) relating to the processing of personal data. It is noteworthy that this provision not only provides for the confidentiality or secrecy of personal data, but also requires availability and integrity. Therefore, this provision is characterised by its intersection with information security. [ 3 ] In practice, this means that the implementation of appropriate TOMs by the controller and processor should be closely coordinated with the controller's or processor's information security department. The obligation to implement appropriate TOMs is closely connected to other provisions stipulating the implementation of TOMs (i.e. Article 24 and 25 GDPR). However, while these provisions relate more generally to compliance with the GDPR as a whole, Article 32 GDPR is directed specifically at ensuring an appropriate level of security of personal data. [ 4 ] While this provision obliges the controller and processor to implement appropriate TOMs, it is subject to debate whether it is possible for a data subject to voluntarily waive specific TOMs and therefore accept a higher risk. [ 5 ] Article 32 GDPR addresses both the controller ( Article 4(7) GDPR ) and processor ( Article 4(8) GDPR) . Hence, in contrast to the general principle that the controller is responsible for GDPR compliance (e.g. for the lawfulness under Article 6(1) GDPR ), this provision sets out an additional and direct responsibility of the processor for ensuring security. [ 6 ] It is noteworthy that according to Article 28(3)(c) GDPR, the processing agreement between a controller and a processor must also provide for an obligation of the processor to take all measures required pursuant to Article 32 GDPR. Additionally, Article 28(3)(f) GDPR requires the processor to assists the controller in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to Articles 32 GDPR. The processor is therefore obliged to implement security measures by various norms. [ 7 ] The provision does not, however, directly apply to software and device manufacturers (see also commentary on Article 25 GDPR ). Nonetheless, Article 32 GDPR holds immense practical significance when it comes to the controller or processor's selection of software and hardware, which must meet the required security standard. In situations of uncertainty, products that do not enable data protection-compliant usage should not be employed. Software and device manufacturers are therefore indirectly affected by this provision. [ 8 ] Article 32(1) GDPR outlines the factors that the controller and processor must consider when conducting the assessment on which measures are \"appropriate\" to contain the risks. These factors are the state of the art, the implementation costs, the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing, as well as the varying likelihood and severity of risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals. It should be noted that these factors include the state of the art and the cost of implementation which are not specifically mentioned in the more general obligation of the controller to implement appropriate TOMs under Article 24 GDPR. Article 32(1) GDPR makes use of the same concept - \"state of the art\" - that was already used in Article 25(1) GDPR (notably, not in Article 24(1) GDPR ). Therefore, see comment on Article 25(1) GDPR for more information. Another criterion for selecting appropriate TOMs are the implementation costs. Also this factor was already subject to consideration in the parallel assessment under Article 25(1) GDPR (but not under Article 24(1) GDPR ). Therefore, see comment on Article 25(1) GDPR for more information. the controller has to take into account the nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing. For these terms, see commentary on Article 24 GDPR which also includes this factors as a necessary consideration. Finally, controllers and processors have to consider the the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons when deciding on appropriate TOMs. In other words, they should complete a risk assessment before carrying out a processing operation. Since such an assessment is also necessary under other provisions, it is recommended to perform one holistic risk assessment, covering all the requirements. See Article 24 GDPR for more information. It should be noted, however, that Article 32(2) GDPR requires specific attention on certain categories of risk, such as the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed. However, the risk should always be considered with the potential harm (i.e. damage); therefore it could be argued that a potential risk of e.g. \u201c destruction \u201d will not be (very) relevant if it causes no tangible harm to a data subject. For further elements, see commentary under Article 32(2) GDPR below. The word 'appropriate' appears not less than three times in Article 32(1): \" the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia as appropriate\" . This indicates that controllers and processors must identify the situation specific risks, assess their potential impact having regard to the particular circumstances of the processing and implement measures to mitigate (at least) those risks which are the most likely to materialise and those whose impact would be the most severe. [ 9 ] In other words, the appropriateness refers to the aim of ensuring the security of the personal data by reducing risks connected to the processing activity. [ 10 ] While the level of security must not be less than what is appropriate, it is completely valid to implement measures that go even further than what would normally be considered appropriate. However, it should be noted that a complete certainty of security will in most cases be impossible to achieve and it would in any case be not proportionate to demand such a level of security. [ 11 ] Reference to appropriateness follows from the principle of proportionality under Article 52(1) CFR. [ 12 ] See commentary on Article 24(1) GDPR for more information. Article 32 GDPR is one of various provisions in the GDPR (e.g. Articles 24 and 25 GDPR) that obliges controllers (and in this case also processors) to implement technical and organisational measures. In the implementation of these measures, these provisions should be read and applied together. More information on TOMs, see commentary on Article 24(1) GDPR . Article 32 GDPR provides a list of examples of TOMs which are supposed to increase the level of security of the processing of personal data (see below for more information on these examples). But an appropriate level of security will never be realised by just one isolated security measures; rather, the combination of all TOMs should ensure an appropriate level of security. [ 13 ] Since the security of processing has to be ensured at all times when personal data is processed, the respective TOMs should be chosen and implemented before the processing takes place. [ 14 ] The controller and the processor are required to implement suitable TOMs within their respective domains. They must document the rationale behind their selection of these measures and how they evaluated the mentioned criteria. [ 15 ] The aim of the implementation of TOMs is to achieve a level of security which is appropriate to the risk. In other words, the TOMs under this provisions should improve and ensure the security of the personal data processed by the controller or processor. As mentioned above, the appropriate level of security demanded by this provision stems from the general principle of 'integrity and confidentiality\u2019 under Article 5(1)(f) GDPR . And it should be noted that this principle should be interpreted in the context of the other principles in order to strike a balance between these goals, e.g. the having of redundant storage as a security measure needing to be balanced with the data minimisation principle. [ 16 ] Article 32(1) GDPR enumerates four examples of technical security measures [ 17 ] that controllers and processors should implement \" as appropriate \". These include pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data; the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems; the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in case of an incident; and a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of security measures. As this list is purely exemplary, it does not provide for any certainty on the side of the processor or controller. Even implementing all measures stated in the list does not guarantee that the requirements outlined Article 32(1) GDPR could be considered fulfilled. This provision functions as an incomplete catalogue of measures, serving only as guidance for the controller or processor. [ 18 ] According to Article 4(5) GDPR, \"pseudonymisation\" means the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person. See commentary on Article 4(5) GDPR for more information on pseudonymisation. \"Pseudonymisation may lower the severity of the consequences of unauthorised access to data.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 1/2025 on Pseudonymisation\u2019, 16 January 2025 (Version for public consultation), margin number 59. For example: A controller's marketing department runs an analysis of the efficiency of different advertisements sent out to different customer segments. Therefore, the department receives the new sales numbers following the ad campaign. However, in order to reduce the risk for data subjects the department receives only pseudonymised numbers without any means to identify specific data subjects. Only with additional information, it would be possible to attribute the numbers to data subjects. Although the GDPR does not explicitly define the concept of encryption, it is described in Article 34(3)(a) GDPR according to which encryption is an effective method for rendering personal data inaccessible to unauthorised individuals. [ 19 ] The cryptographic techniques employed for encryption, in accordance with the current state of the art, play a vital role in ensuring information security in line with the provisions of Article 32 GDPR. Symmetric encryption methods, such as AES, Blowfish, IDEA, RC6, and Twofish, employ the same parameter (key) for both encryption and decryption. They are well-suited for tasks like disk or file encryption. On the other hand, asymmetric cryptographic methods, like ECC, ElGamal, and RSA, rely on a key pair consisting of a public key and a private key. The private key is known only to the authorized person. When sending a message to that person, the public key is used to encrypt it, and only the authorized person can decrypt the message using the corresponding private key. Asymmetric cryptographic methods can also be used for electronic signing, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of data. [ 20 ] Controllers and processors must implement measures which are able to ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, [ 21 ] and resilience of the processing systems and services used. The objective is to continuously  maintain security requirements over the entire duration of processing (\" ongoing... \"). This ensures that security measures are consistently applied in a dynamic and ongoing manner. The term \" systems \" should be interpreted broadly, encompassing not only technical systems for automated processing but also systems supporting paper-based processing. Similarly, the concept of \" services \" falls under the same understanding. The individuals involved in handling these systems and services play a role in the processing of personal data. Regular training to maintain an ongoing awareness of risks and the importance of adhering to established rules for data protection are also essential and must not be bypassed. [ 22 ] \" Confidentiality \" is not only a technical notion but a GDPR principle established in Article 5(1)(f) GDPR . It entails safeguarding information from unauthorized disclosure, allowing access to confidential data and information solely by authorized individuals through approved means. Measures implemented to ensure or facilitate confidentiality include data encryption, access control systems, permissions, and authentication based on one or multiple factors. [ 23 ] \" Integrity \" is also referred to as a principle in Article 5(1)(f) GDPR . Various references to integrity can be found in different contexts, such as the completeness or authenticity of data (Recital 49) and the right to rectification ( Article 16 GDPR ). Integrity encompasses both the integrity of data and the proper functioning of systems. Unauthorised modifications constitute a breach of information integrity, impacting not only the actual content but also meta-data such as the author, sender, and creation timestamp. To protect integrity, measures such as electronic signatures or check digits, input controls (logging) to track who accessed, modified, or deleted personal data and when, as well as authorization systems for managing access, are employed. [ 24 ] One big risk factor comes from computer viruses which could be reduced by the implementation of firewalls, antivirus software or email filters. [ 25 ] The term \" availability \" refers to the likelihood that a technical system will fulfill specific requests within an agreed-upon time-frame. Systems and services are considered available if they can be used at any given time. When systems and services are unavailable, controllers and processors are unable to maintain control over the personal data processed through them. Impairments to availability can range from minor delays in usability to complete system failures that last for an extended period. Various factors can contribute to such impairments, including defective hardware, faulty software, power supply issues, or disrupted network connections. To ensure availability, diverse security measures may need to be implemented, such as providing complete replacement systems or individual backup systems, emergency power supplies, and conducting regular functional tests. [ 26 ] Companies will also have to ensure the \" resilience \" of the systems and services related to processing. The GDPR does not describe which measures contribute positively to resilience. In IT, resilience is the ability of an information system to continue to: (i) operate under adverse conditions or stress, even if in a degraded or debilitated state, while maintaining essential operational capabilities; and (ii) recover to an effective operational posture in a time frame consistent with mission needs. [ 27 ] In other words, it is about the tolerance and compensatory ability of a system against disturbances. For example: Suppose there is a network consisting of multiple nodes. If one of the network nodes is targeted and disrupted by an attack, the system demonstrates resilience if the overall functionality of the network remains unaffected because another network node seamlessly takes over its function. In this scenario, the system's resilience is evaluated based on its ability to withstand a certain number of attacks without experiencing significant functional limitations. This measurement, known as \"k-resilience,\" quantifies the system's capability to handle multiple attacks while maintaining its operational integrity. [ 28 ] Resilience measures involve minimising attack possibilities, such as by implementing essential functionality and promptly installing security updates to improve systems security. Additionally, detecting attacks or disruptions and responding appropriately is crucial. Training employees to identify issues and learn from mistakes is also important. Processing should be designed to minimise damage during incidents, such as by transitioning to a fail-safe mode or automatically disconnecting from the Internet in given cases. Creating opportunities for intervention, including human intervention, can further enhance resilience. [ 29 ] Article 32(1)(c) GDPR requires that systems and services be capable of restoring the availability and access to personal data in the event of a physical or technical incident. Unlike in the preceding provision (Article 32(1)(b) GDPR), in this case the incident has occurred (and it must have a technical or physical nature). For example, one can consider scenarios such as physical destruction or loss of storage devices, unauthorised data encryption resulting from a ransomware attack (technical incident), or the destruction of system components due to fire, flooding, or devastation (physical incident). In such cases, controllers and processors must be able to restore availability and access to personal data. [ 30 ] In practice, this security measures have to be implemented before the incident occurred to be effective. Examples of measures include regular backups or even the necessity to store data on multiple in different locations. [ 31 ] The expression \" in a timely manner \" does not establish a specific deadline, as the timeline depends on the factual circumstances and the seriousness of the issues the controller is dealing with. However, this wording must be understood as indicating that the controller shall restore availability and access as soon as possible. [ 32 ] Article 30(1)(d) GDPR mentions, as an example of a security measure, the implementation of a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of TOMs for ensuring the security of the processing. This example is related to the accountability principle stipulated in Article 5(2) GDPR. [ 33 ] As the wording of this provision suggests, these are not measures that directly protect data and systems security. These are instead \"meta-measures\" aiming at guaranteeing that security systems continue to be effective from a dynamic perspective, namely through time. Typical example here is a test where IT experts simulate an external attack, in order to evaluate the response of pre-existing security mechanisms. [ 34 ] The GDPR does not specify a time framework for such testing operations. However, frequency in checks mainly depends on the type of risks that a given system must face and the ongoing technological developments in the field concerned. [ 35 ] Article 32(2) GDPR stipulates that the assessment of the appropriate level of security, as described in Article 32(1) GDPR, has to take into account the risks that are presented by processing, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to the processed personal data. The second paragraph therefore builds on Article 32(1) GDPR in the sense that it provides examples of the risks that are most likely to occur, and/or the most severe. Notably, the risks mentioned here are the risks described in case of a personal data breach under Article 4(12) GDPR. [ 36 ] These risks are further somewhat similar to the criteria that need to be considered when a Data Protection Impact Assessment (\"DPIA\") is carried out in accordance with Article 35 GDPR . [ 37 ] The risks refer to failures that happen either per accident or unlawful. See commentary on Article 4(12) GDPR for more information. For example: The purposeful deletion of personal data when it is no longer necessary for the processing is not a risk that has to be considered under this provision. The specific risks mentioned in this provision are identical to those listed in the definition of a personal data breach under Article 4(12) GDPR . Therefore, see commentary on Article 4(12) GDPR for more information. Article 32(3) GDPR stipulates that adherence to codes of conduct or certification mechanisms (Articles 40 and 42 GDPR respectively) can be used as an element to demonstrate compliance with the controller's or processor's obligation to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. This provision is supposed to support compliance with the accountability principle established in Article 5(2) GDPR and Article 24(1) GDPR . It should be noted that neither of these options reduce the controller or processor\u2019s responsibility. However, if asked to prove they took all possible measures to avoid the violation, adherence to these would undoubtedly play an important role. [ 38 ] This provision is basically identical to Article 24(3) GDPR , therefore see commentary on this provision for more information. See also commentary on Article 42(4) GDPR . Most processing operations involve the use of human resources (i.e. the involvement of a natural person in the processing activity). Whenever a person is authorised to access personal data, a data security issue arises. For these reasons, Article 32(4) GDPR requires the controller and processor to ensure that such persons act solely and exclusively on the instructions of the controller, [ 39 ] with the only exception of those individual operations that are imposed by EU or national law. The verb 'ensure' indicates that controllers and processors must provide some form of guarantee with respect to the result. The provision also speaks of \" any natural person [...] who has access to personal data \". This includes employees, freelancers, interns, external consultants or employees of service companies, insofar as they have access to personal data (see commentary on Article 29 GDPR ). In contrast, other third parties, including visitors or customers who access the data unlawfully, are not included in the definition, as they do not act \" under the authority of the controller or processor \". [ 40 ] To comply with this obligation, controllers and processors should establish clear rules of conduct, internal instructions and sanctioning procedures. Technical measures that prevent unauthorised access are also essential in certain cases. Controllers and processors must also regularly check whether these measures are effective and actually followed. [ 41 ] For example: Potential measures include the selection of trustworthy employees who will reliable follow the controller's or processor's instructions as well as implementing clear internal procedures and instructions and regular training for employees.

In the case of a personal data breach, the controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority competent in accordance with Article 55, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Where the notification to the supervisory authority is not made within 72 hours, it shall be accompanied by reasons for the delay. 2.   The processor shall notify the controller without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach. 3.   The notification referred to in paragraph 1 shall at least: 4.   Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide the information at the same time, the information may be provided in phases without undue further delay. 5.   The controller shall document any personal data breaches, comprising the facts relating to the personal data breach, its effects and the remedial action taken. That documentation shall enable the supervisory authority to verify compliance with this Article. Article 33 GDPR regulates the controller and processor's obligations in case of a personal data breach (as defined in Article 4(12) GDPR ). [ 1 ] Specifically this provision provides for the controller's obligation to notify the supervisory authority (\"SA\") about personal data breaches. This obligations is therefore closely related to the parallel obligation in Article 34 GDPR to notify data subjects of a personal data breach. It is also closely connected to Article 32 GDPR which obliges controllers and processors to implement technical and organisational measures ensuring an appropriate risk and should therefore prevent personal data breaches in the first place and also make sure that personal data breaches are detected as early as possible. The obligations in connection with the notification of the SA are manifestations of the transparency principle ( Article 5(1)(a) GDPR ) as well as the accountability principle ( Article 5(2) GDPR ) since it obliges the controller to be transparent with the SA regarding its deficiencies. At the same time, this obligation can be expected to have a preventive function as controllers may try to avoid notifying SAs about their shortcomings regarding the security of processing of personal data. [ 2 ] All this is also the case in connection with the obligation to notify data subjects provided by Article 34 GDPR . In order to ensure the controller's capacity to investigate personal data breaches in time and to notify the SA without undue delay, the controller should implement appropriate procedures and train its employees. Such a procedure is regularly referred to as Incident Response Plan and includes topics like internal responsibilities and departments to which incidents should be reported internally, templates for the investigation and notifications to the SA as well as data subjects and how personal data breaches should be documented. [ 3 ] Ideally, the Incident Response Plan should also provide for a mechanism in order to assess the the risks to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. Obviously, this procedure should also cover the notification to data subjects under Article 34 GDPR . Paragraph 1 imposes an obligation on controllers to notify the competent SA of a personal data breach without undue delay (not later than 72 hours) unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Paragraph 2 imposes a corresponding obligation on the processor, with the only difference being that the recipient of the notification should be the controller. Paragraph 3 lays out a non-exhaustive list of information that must be provided to the SA. Paragraph 4 grants controllers the possibility of sharing details about the breach in different phases when all the information cannot be provided at the same time. Finally, under paragraph 5, and in line with the accountability principle, the controller must document any data breach including the facts, effects, and the remedial action taken. EDPB Guidelines : EDPB, 'Guidelines 01/2021 on Examples regarding Personal Data Breach Notification', 14 December 2021 (Version 2.0) ; and EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 9/2022 on personal data breach notification under GDPR\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.0). Article 33(1) GDPR introduces the controller's obligation to notify the SA without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours in case of a personal data breach. This provision also provides for an exception from this obligation in case the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. In case the notification is not possible within 72 hours, the controller has to include the reason for this delay in the notification to the SA. The notification of a data breach serves several purposes. Primarily it should make the SA aware of the personal data breach and enable it to assess the personal data breach for itself. [ 4 ] By establishing contact with the SA, it also allows controllers to identify potential solutions and, if necessary, receive instructions on how to inform the affected data subjects. The EDPB emphasizes that a data breach is ultimately a matter of data security directly affecting the data subjects' interests. Therefore, it is essentially a measure aimed at protecting individual interests. However, failure to report a breach to a SA (or a data subject - see Article 34 GDPR) is subject to sanctions under Article 83 GDPR. [ 5 ] It should be recalled that according to Article 32 GDPR , both controllers and processors are obligated to implement suitable technical and organisational measures to ensure an adequate level of security in relation to the risks associated with the processing of personal data. These measures should consider factors such as the current state of technology, the implementation costs, the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing, as well as the varying likelihood and severity of risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals. Furthermore, the GDPR mandates the implementation of appropriate technological and organisational measures to promptly detect and determine whether a personal data breach has occurred. The occurrence of a breach triggers the notification obligation. [ 6 ] The notification obligation stipulated in this provision refers to the notion of a personal data breach defined in Article 4(12) GDPR , i.e. \u201c a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed \u201d. For more information, see commentary on Article 4(12) GDPR . The reporting obligation outlined in Article 33(1) GDPR applies to the data controller, encompassing both natural persons and public or non-public entities as defined in Article 4(7) GDPR. In cases where multiple controllers jointly determine the purposes and means of processing as defined in Article 26 GDPR , each controller is responsible for reporting their own data breaches as well as those of the other controller(s). However, it is possible for the controllers to establish a different arrangement regarding the reporting obligations through an agreement on joint responsibility as required under Article 26(1) GDPR . [ 7 ] The obligation in Article 33(1) GDPR does not address a processor of the controller. However, according to Article 33(2) GDPR, the processor has to inform the controller in case they become aware of a personal data breach (see commentary on paragraph 2). [ 8 ] Notably, the GDPR imposes no obligation on manufacturers of hard or software to inform SAs about (potential) personal data breaches. [ 9 ] Article 33(1) GDPR outlines that controllers have an obligation to notify the competent SA of a personal data breach once they have become \" aware \" of it. \"[A] controller should be regarded as having become \u201caware\u201d when that controller has a reasonable degree of certainty that a security incident has occurred that has led to personal data being compromised.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 9/2022 on personal data breach notification under GDPR\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.0), margin number 31. It is not necessary that the controller has absolute certainty about the occurrence of a personal data breach; a reasonable degree is sufficient. [ 10 ] Therefore, a controller does not have to notify the SA of a mere suspicion that a personal data breach might occurred. [ 11 ] In certain cases, the occurrence of personal data breach may be evident from the beginning, while in other instances, it may take some time until a controller can be reasonable certain. Nevertheless, the focus should be on promptly initiating an investigation into the incident to determine if there has been a breach of personal data. If a breach is confirmed, appropriate remedial actions should be taken, and if necessary, notifications should be provided without delay. As recalled above, the GDPR requires the controller to implement all appropriate technical protection and organisational measures to establish immediately whether a breach has taken place and to inform promptly the supervisory authority and the data subjects. [ 12 ] After first being informed of a potential breach by an individual, a media organisation, or another source, or when it has itself detected a security incident, the controller may undertake a short period of investigation in order to establish whether or not a breach has in fact occurred. During this period of investigation the controller may not be regarded as being \u201caware\u201d. However, it is expected that the initial investigation should begin as soon as possible and establish with a reasonable degree of certainty whether a breach has taken place; a more detailed investigation can then follow. EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 9/2022 on personal data breach notification under GDPR\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.0), margin number 34. The EDPB's approach regarding the term \"being aware\" suggests a rather high threshold to prove awareness, as it must be established that the controller has \u201c reasonable certainty \u201d. Accordingly, there is a distinction between awareness as defined by the EDPB and being informed of a potential breach. Whilst being informed of a potential breach does not amount to \u201c awareness \u201d, it does trigger an obligation on the controller to investigate further to determine (i.e., to gain \"awareness\") whether a breach of personal data has occurred. [ 13 ] However, it is important to emphasise that once the controller has reasonably established that a breach has occurred and the conditions specified in Article 33(1) of the GDPR have been met, they must promptly notify the SA, preferably within 72 hours, unless there are exceptional circumstances. Failure to act in a timely manner and subsequently failing to notify the SA of a confirmed breach could be considered a violation of the notification requirement outlined in Article 33 of the GDPR. [ 14 ] There is some debate around the question of whether the knowledge of the controller's processor is also attributable to the controller, i.e. if the controller should be considered aware, at the time the processor becomes aware of a personal data breach. According to the EDPB, this is not the case and the controller can only be considered aware of the personal data breach once it is informed by the processor or it becomes aware by other means. [ 15 ] Once the controller has become aware of a personal data breach likely to \u201c result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons \u201d (see below), it must notify the SA competent in accordance with Article 55 GDPR . [ 16 ] However, where there is cross-border processing under Article 56 GDPR , the competent SA for the notification is the one of the main establishment or of the single establishment of the controller or processor. [ 17 ] \"This means that whenever a breach takes place in the context of cross-border processing and notification is required, the controller will need to notify the lead supervisory authority. Therefore, when drafting its breach response plan, a controller must make an assessment as to which supervisory authority is the lead supervisory authority that it will need to notify. This will allow the controller to respond promptly to a breach and to meet its obligations in respect of Article 33. It should be clear that in the event of a breach involving cross-border processing, notification must be made to the lead supervisory authority, which is not necessarily where the affected data subjects are located, or indeed where the breach has taken place. When notifying the lead authority, the controller should indicate, where appropriate, whether the breach involves establishments located in other Member States, and in which Member States data subjects are likely to have been affected by the breach. If the controller has any doubt as to the identity of the lead supervisory authority then it should, at a minimum, notify the local supervisory authority where the breach has taken place\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 9/2022 on personal data breach notification under GDPR\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.0), margin number 69 footnotes omitted. If a controller who is not established in the Union but falls under the scope of Article 3(2) or Article 3(3) GDPR experiences a personal data breach, they are still obligated to fulfill the notification requirements outlined in Articles 33 and 34 of the GDPR. In such cases, the controller is required to notify each SA in the Member State where affected data subjects reside. [ 18 ] It is worth recalling that in the handling of a data breach, a controller should not only consider the notification of the competent SA in accordance with this provision, but also the notification of affected data subjects ( Article 34 GDPR ). Further, it can be reasonable to also inform processors involved, business partners or other stakeholder even if such obligation is not directly stipulated in the GDPR. It is questionable what consequences a notification to a SA has, that is not the competent one and whether the SA would be obliged to forward the notification to another SA or at least notify the controller of any doubts regarding its competence. [ 19 ] Notifying the relevant SA must occur \u201c without undue delay \u201d from the moment controllers become \u201c aware \u201d of a personal data breach and unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. The notification of the SA has to happen without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after the controller became aware of it. It is crucial that controllers comply with this deadline, as its core purpose is to limit the damage to natural persons affected by the data breach. [ 20 ] According to Recital 87 GDPR, the assessment of whether the controller acted without undue delay \u201c should [take] into account in particular the nature and gravity of the personal data breach and its consequences and adverse effects \u201d. Although this suggests that the qualifier \u201c without undue delay \u201d is circumstance-specific, Article 33(1) GDPR provides a general rule to satisfy this obligation: \u201cwhere feasible \u201d, the controller must notify the relevant authority within a maximum of 72 hours. This suggests that, in some instances, they can take longer than 72 hours to do so. In that case, the controller has to provide the SA with the reasons for the delay (see below). \"Such a scenario might take place where, for example, a controller experiences multiple, similar confidentiality breaches over a short period of time, affecting large numbers of data subjects in the same way. A controller could become aware of a breach and, whilst beginning its investigation, and before notification, detect further similar breaches, which have different causes. Depending on the circumstances, it may take the controller some time to establish the extent of the breaches and, rather than notify each breach individually, the controller instead organises a meaningful notification that represents several very similar breaches, with possible different causes. This could lead to notification to the supervisory authority being delayed by more than 72 hours after the controller first becomes aware of these breaches.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 9/2022 on personal data breach notification under GDPR\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.0), margin number 63. Notification of data breaches is sometimes disregarded by controllers, since it could trigger an investigation by the competent SA, especially with regard to controller's duties pursuant to Article 32 GDPR . However, it must be considered that the controller's inactivity could also lead to sanctions, including fines pursuant to Article 83(4)(a) GDPR. The obligation to notify the competent SA of a personal data breach is not triggered where the breach is \" unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons \u201d. The GDPR does not define what constitutes a \u201c risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons \u201d. [ 21 ] Recital 75 GDPR only outlines potential situations where such a risk is likely to materialise, such as in cases of identity theft, data subjects\u2019 loss of control over their personal data or where they are unable to exercise related rights, amongst other situations. [ 22 ] Some of these are reiterated in Recital 85 GDPR, which labels these as \u201c physical, material or non-material damage to natural persons \u201d. [ 23 ] \"This means that immediately upon becoming aware of a breach, it is vitally important that the controller should not only seek to contain the incident but it should also assess the risk that could result from it. There are two important reasons for this: firstly, knowing the likelihood and the potential severity of the impact on the individual will help the controller to take effective steps to contain and address the breach; secondly, it will help it to determine whether notification is required to the supervisory authority and, if necessary, to the individuals concerned.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 9/2022 on personal data breach notification under GDPR\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.0), margin number 101. That said, controllers must objectively consider the likelihood and severity of the impact of the breach on rights and freedoms by taking into account the following: Type of breach : For instance, a breach of confidentiality in which unauthorised parties gain access to medical information may have different consequences for an individual compared to a breach where an individual's medical details have been lost and are no longer accessible. [ 24 ] Nature, sensitivity, and volume of personal data : Typically, the level of risk to individuals affected increases with the sensitivity of the data involved. Breaches that involve health data, identity documents, or financial information like credit card details have the potential to cause harm individually. However, when these types of data are used together, they can increase the risk of identity theft. The combination of multiple personal data elements is generally more sensitive and poses a greater risk than a single piece of personal data. However, it is important to consider other personal data that may already be accessible about the data subject. For instance, the disclosure of an individual's name and address under normal circumstances is unlikely to result in significant harm. However, if the name and address of an adoptive parent are disclosed to a birth parent, the consequences could be extremely severe for both the adoptive parent and the child. [ 25 ] In any case, it is not necessary that special categories of data are involved in order to be a risk for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. [ 26 ] How easily individuals can be identified : The breached data can potentially enable direct or indirect identification, although the likelihood may vary depending on the specific circumstances of the breach and the public availability of related personal information. This aspect becomes particularly significant in the context of breaches affecting confidentiality and availability of data. [ 27 ] How serious the consequences of the breach are to individuals : When breaches involve certain categories of personal data, the potential harm to individuals can be particularly severe. This is especially true when the breach has the potential to lead to identity theft or fraud, physical harm, psychological distress, humiliation, or damage to reputation. Additionally, if the breached data pertains to vulnerable individuals, they may be at an even greater risk of experiencing harm. [ 28 ] Whether individuals affected are particularly vulnerable : For example children or other individuals who may be subject to greater risk. [ 29 ] Whether the controller has a particular role that may entail a higher risk : For example, a medical organisation which processes special categories of personal data. [ 30 ] The size of the breach in terms of numbers of individuals affected : The impact of a breach can vary depending on the number of individuals affected, ranging from just a few to potentially thousands or more. While it is generally true that a larger number of affected individuals can lead to a greater overall impact, it is important to recognize that even a breach affecting a single individual can have severe consequences. The extent of the impact depends on factors such as the nature of the compromised personal data and the specific circumstances surrounding the breach. Assessing the likelihood and severity of the impact on those affected is crucial in evaluating the significance of a breach. [ 31 ] Hence, when assessing the risk associated with a breach, the controller must consider both the potential severity of the impact on individuals' rights and freedoms and the likelihood of such impacts occurring. It is crucial to evaluate these factors together to determine the overall risk level. If the consequences of a breach are particularly severe, the risk level increases. Likewise, if the likelihood of those consequences happening is higher, the risk level is also elevated. In cases where there is uncertainty or doubt, it is recommended that the controller errs on the side of caution and proceeds with notification. Annex B of the Guidelines on data breach provides valuable examples of different breach scenarios that entail risks or high risks to individuals. [ 32 ] \"[I]f personal data have been made essentially unintelligible to unauthorised parties and where the data are a copy or a backup exists, a confidentiality breach involving properly encrypted personal data may not need to be notified to the supervisory authority. This is because such a breach is unlikely to pose a risk to individuals\u2019 rights and freedoms.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 9/2022 on personal data breach notification under GDPR\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.0), margin number 78. For example: \"A breach that would not require notification to the supervisory authority would be the loss of a securely encrypted mobile device, utilised by the controller and its staff. Provided the encryption key remains within the secure possession of the controller and this is not the sole copy of the personal data then the personal data would be inaccessible to an attacker. This means the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects in question. If it later becomes evident that the encryption key was compromised or that the encryption software or algorithm is vulnerable, then the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons will change and thus notification may now be required.\" [ 33 ] According to the last sentence of Article 33(1) GDPR, the controller must provide the SA with the reasons for the delay together with the notification, if the controller was not able to make the notification withing 72 hours. In other words, the controller must provide an explanation outlining why notifying the relevant authorities within 72 hours was not feasible. This provision does not contain any requirements for the justification of the delay; however, the reasons should be more detailed in cases with severe personal data breaches or longer delays. Purely personal reasons of the controller (e.g. sickness or vacation of people involved in the notification or investigation process) will not be sufficient since the controller's technical and organisational measures should provide for such eventualities. [ 34 ] \"Such a scenario might take place where, for example, a controller experiences multiple, similar confidentiality breaches over a short period of time, affecting large numbers of data subjects in the same way. A controller could become aware of a breach and, whilst beginning its investigation, and before notification, detect further similar breaches, which have different causes. Depending on the circumstances, it may take the controller some time to establish the extent of the breaches and, rather than notify each breach individually, the controller instead organises a meaningful notification that represents several very similar breaches, with possible different causes. This could lead to notification to the supervisory authority being delayed by more than 72 hours after the controller first becomes aware of these breaches\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 9/2022 on personal data breach notification under GDPR\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.0), margin number 63. However, whenever possible, the controller should make use of the possibility to notify in phases (see Article 33(4) GDPR) instead of not notifying the SA at all in the first 72 hours after becoming aware of the personal data breach. The controller bears the ultimate responsibility for safeguarding personal data, but the processor plays a crucial role in enabling the controller to fulfill its obligations. In case personal data processed by the processor is affected by a personal data breach in the sphere of the processor, it is likely that only the processor has the necessary knowledge to detect (and further investigate) a data breach. In other cases, the processor might just become aware of a personal data breach earlier than the controller. [ 35 ] Regarding the notification of a personal data breach, Article 33(2) of the GDPR clarifies that when the processor becomes aware of a breach concerning the personal data it processes on behalf of the controller, it must promptly notify the latter. Article 33(2) GDPR does not require the processor to assess the likelihood of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. [ 36 ] Instead, the processor must report any personal data breach to the controller. The latter will then assess the risk and, according to the criteria established in Article 33(1), possibly notify the SA, should the required threshold be met. The controller can impose a contractual obligation on the processor to assess the risk level pursuant to Article 28(3) GDPR . The legal responsibility will nonetheless ultimately remain with the controller. [ 37 ] It should also be recalled that in accordance with Article 28(3)(f) GDPR the processing agreement between the controller and the processor must include the processor's obligation to assist the controller in ensuring compliance with Article 33 GDPR. [ 38 ] However, the obligation under this provision is independent from the conclusion of a processing agreement. [ 39 ] The recipient of the provision is the processor ( Article 4(8) GDPR ) appointed under Article 28 of the GDPR. Article 33(2) GDPR instructs processors to notify controllers once they become \u201c aware \u201d of a personal data breach. The GDPR does not elaborate much on this provision, but the definition of \u201c aware \u201d likely reflects its meaning under Article 33(1) GDPR (see above). According to Article 33(2) GDPR, the processor has the obligation to notify the controller of a data breach it becomes aware of. There is no obligation of the processor to notify the competent SA. This obligations exists in parallel of the processor's (contractual) obligation to assist the controller under Article 28(3)(f) GDPR , \" in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor .\" The contract between controller and processor should further specify how the obligation under Article 33(2) GDPR must be complied with. It is possible for the controller to stipulate within its contract with the processor that the latter must notify the SA directly in the event of a breach. The contract between the controller and the processor pursuant to Article 28(3) GDPR may also stipulate a specific time frame in which the processor must notify the controller. However, the legal responsibility to notify the relevant SA will remain with the controller regardless of such a contract, which exclusively regulates obligations between private subjects. [ 40 ] The contribution of the processor is essential for the controller to fulfill its responsibility for the notification procedure to the SA, as stipulated in Article 33(1) GDPR. The longer the processor delays the notification, the shorter the time the controller has to comply with its notification duties under Article 33(1) GDPR. [ 41 ] The breach notification by the processor must occur \" without undue delay \". In other words, the controller must be immediately informed, without any specific maximum time limit of 72 hours in this situation. [ 42 ] \"The GDPR does not provide an explicit time limit within which the processor must alert the controller, except that it must do so \u201cwithout undue delay\u201d. Therefore, the EDPB recommends the processor promptly notifies the controller, with further information about the breach provided in phases as more details become available. This is important in order to help the controller to meet the requirement of notification to the supervisory authority within 72 hours.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 9/2022 on personal data breach notification under GDPR\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.0), margin number 45. Article 33(3) GDPR provides a list of details that the controller must include in a notification to a SA. The phrase \u201c shall at least \u201d indicates that the notification must include the elements enumerated from Article 33(3)(a) to (d) GDPR, but the controller may provide further information. With this information, the SA should be capable to assess the personal data breach on its own. [ 43 ] This list includes the following elements: According to Article 33(3)(a) GDPR, the controller must describe (i) the nature of the personal data breach to the SA, including, where possible, the categories of (ii) data subjects and (iii) data records concerned, as well as their (iv) respective approximate numbers. In other words, the notification should address the qualitative (nature and categories) and quantitative (numbers) aspects of the data breach, with regard to both the objective (data) and the subjective elements (data subjects). As mentioned above, the EDPB outlines three distinct categories of personal data breaches. These include a \u201c confidentiality breach \u201d, where there is an unauthorised or accidental disclosure of, or access to, personal data; an \u201c integrity breach \u201d, where there is an unauthorised or accidental alteration of personal data; or an \u201c availability breach \u201d, where there is an accidental or unauthorised loss of access to, or destruction of, personal data. This is, in essence, the \" nature \" of the personal data breach. [ 44 ] The GDPR does not provide additional information as to what \u201c categories of data subjects \u201d mean in this context. The EDPB suggests a flexible approach, inspired by the actual objective of the notification, which is primarily to mitigate harm to the rights of the individuals affected. In other words, this information should describe the type of individuals involved  such as children, vulnerable groups, people with disabilities, employees or customers. A data breach involving personal data related to the health of underage users, for instance, necessitates significantly different actions compared to the disclosure of email addresses. [ 45 ] This refers to the different types of records that the controller may process, such as health data, educational records, social care information, financial details, bank account numbers, passport numbers and so on. [ 46 ] The numbers should be as specific as possible. However, in situations where precise information is unavailable, such as the exact number of affected data subjects or records, it should not hinder the timely notification of a breach. The GDPR permits the use of approximations when determining the number of individuals impacted and the number of personal data records involved. The emphasis should be on addressing the negative consequences of the breach rather than solely providing precise figures. To guarantee both effectiveness and preciseness, the controller can carry out a notification in phases under Article 33(4) GDPR (see below). [ 47 ] \"Recital 85 GDPR makes it clear that one of the purposes of notification is limiting damage to individuals. Accordingly, if the types of data subjects or the types of personal data indicate a risk of particular damage occurring as a result of a breach (e.g. identity theft, fraud, financial loss, threat to professional secrecy), then it is important the notification indicates these categories. In this way, it is linked to the requirement of describing the likely consequences of the breach.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 9/2022 on personal data breach notification under GDPR\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.0), margin number 51. Under Article 33(3)(b) GDPR, the SA must be given the contact details of the data protection officer or other contact point where further information can be obtained. The name and contact details of the controller\u2019s data protection officer are therefore required. In the absence of a DPO, the controller may provide details of a \u201c point of contact \u201d capable of sharing further information should the SA require it. [ 48 ] Article 33(3)(c) GDPR requires the controller to describe the \u201c likely consequences\u201d of the data breach in its notification to the SA. It is important to note that such consequences do not need to have materialised at that point. Thus, controllers should consider the potential adverse effects listed in Recital 85 GDPR, which enumerates various examples of \u201c physical, material or non-material damage to natural persons \u201d caused by a personal data breach. [ 49 ] This requirement is likely to be a challenge for companies in practice, as these consequences are usually difficult to assess and usually depend on a number of factors. [ 50 ] Finally, Article 33(3)(d) GDPR stipulates that the controller must outline any measures it has taken or plans to take to remedy the personal data breach. The controller must also describe the measures taken or planned to mitigate possible adverse effects. The controller is not required to wait for feedback from the SA regarding the implementation of the \"planned\" measures. [ 51 ] As mentioned, the controller can provide further information than that required pursuant to Article 33(3)(a) to (d) GDPR. It is important to note that Recital 88 GDPR indicates that the \u201c rules concerning format and procedures applicable to the notification of personal data breaches \u201d depend on the particular circumstances of each breach. [ 52 ] Any additional information that should be provided will therefore differ according to each breach. For example, the controller can name the processor responsible for the personal data breach. This may help other controllers, which rely on services provided by the same processor, to take necessary measures against additional personal data breaches. Nevertheless, the SA might request on its on further details on the personal data breach in the course of an investigation. [ 53 ] It should be noted that, in general, the notification will not have to include details on a level that would entail the disclosure of trade secrets or the breached data itself. However, it cannot be excluded that that might be the case. [ 54 ] There are also circumstances where the controller can only notify the competent authority in phases. This option, outlined in Article 33(4) GDPR, is only permissible \u201c in so far as, it is not possible to provide the information at the same time \u201d. This indicates that the GDPR acknowledges that controllers may not always possess all the required information about a breach during the first investigation and within 72 hours of becoming aware of it, as complete and comprehensive details of the incident may not be immediately accessible during this initial time frame. This scenario is more likely to occur in the case of complex breaches, such as certain types of cybersecurity incidents, where conducting an in-depth forensic investigation may be necessary to accurately determine the nature of the breach and the extent of personal data compromise. As a result, in many instances, the controller will need to conduct further investigations and provide additional information at a later stage. Consequently, it permits a phased approach to notification. [ 55 ] \"The EDPB recommends that when the controller first notifies the supervisory authority, the controller should also inform the supervisory authority if the controller does not yet have all the required information and will provide more details later on. The supervisory authority should agree how and when additional information should be provided. This does not prevent the controller from providing further information at any other stage, if it becomes aware of additional relevant details about the breach that need to be provided to the supervisory authority\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 9/2022 on personal data breach notification under GDPR\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.0), margin number 57. Again, this should occur \u201c without undue further delay \u201d and does not release the controller from the obligation to notify the SA, where feasible, in 72 hours, even if this information cannot contain all the necessary information. [ 56 ] The controller should also indicate that there will be a follow-up and provide reasons as to why it had notified the SA in phases. In any case, the possibility of notifying the SA in phases should not become common practice for controllers. [ 57 ] \"It should also be clear that after making an initial notification, a controller could update the supervisory authority if a follow-up investigation uncovers evidence that the security incident was contained and no breach actually occurred. This information could then be added to the information already given to the supervisory authority and the incident recorded accordingly as not being a breach. There is no penalty for reporting an incident that ultimately transpires not to be a breach.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 9/2022 on personal data breach notification under GDPR\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.0), margin number 60. The need to provide the information to the SA in phases should be considered objectively. The providing of information in phases should be considered unreasonable if it hinders the implementation of mitigating measures in due time. [ 58 ] Article 33(5) GDPR requires controllers to always document personal data breaches they are aware of. This obligation should, inter alia , enable the SA to verify the controller's compliance with the notification obligation provided by Article 33 GDPR. The documentation must include: the facts of the breach; the effects it has; and the remedial action taken by the controller. It is important to note that this applies to \u201c all \u201d breaches, regardless of the potential risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons; therefore also regardless of whether the SA was notified or not. [ 59 ] This obligation is linked to the accountability principle under Article 5(2) GDPR . [ 60 ] Whilst this documentation exists to help the SA in its duties, it can also benefit the controller itself. Indeed, it may rely on it to justify its decision not to notify the SA of a breach where it considers that there is no likely risk. Moreover, as the principle of accountability requires the controller not only to comply with, but also to be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR, keeping records about data breaches means that it will be easier for the controller to prove that they complied with the relevant security obligations, even if these were not sufficient to avoid the breach. For example: In order to assess whether a controller has implemented technical and organisational measures to detect personal data breaches, the SA could ask for the record of personal data breaches. If the controller is a big company with numerous data processing activities, it is unlikely that there are no entries. If that is still the case, the controller probably has implemented insufficient measures to detect personal data breaches or failed to document them accordingly. In any case, the SA might consider it necessary to investigate further. \"In addition to these details, the EDPB recommends that the controller also document its reasoning for the decisions taken in response to a breach. In particular, if a breach is not notified, a justification for that decision should be documented. This should include reasons why the controller considers the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 9/2022 on personal data breach notification under GDPR\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.0), margin number 125. As is the case for other documentation obligations, the GDPR does not provide a retention period for this documentation. The controller should determine an appropriate period of retention considering the fact that such documentation will normally not contain any personal data itself. [ 61 ] Not covered by this documentation obligation are security incidents that were assessed but did not constitute personal data breaches. However, controllers could also decide to document such instances. [ 62 ] \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 33 GDPR \u2191 There was no equivalent to Article 33 GDPR under the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. Indeed, Article 17 of the Directive only required controllers to take adequate measures to protect personal data from breaches. However, Member States such as Germany (Section 42(a) German Federal Data Protection Act 2017) as well as Spain (Article 88 Spanish Data Protection Law 2007 provided for a similar obligation under their national law. See, Burton , in Kuner, Bygrave, Docksey, The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): A Commentary, Article 33 GDPR, p. 642-643 (Oxford University Press 2020). According to Bensoussan , the drafting of Article 33 GDPR drew inspiration from Article 4 ePrivacy Directive 2002/58/EC. The latter imposes a notification obligation on providers of electronic communication services. However, unlike Article 33 GDPR, the ePrivacy Directive imposes a broader obligation on electronic communication services as they must notify authorities of all breaches rather than only those which pose a risk to natural persons. See, Bensoussan , Reglement europeen sur la protection des donnees, p. 250 (Bruylant 2017). \u2191 Jandt , in K\u00fchling, Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 33 GDPR, margin number 1 (C.H.

When the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall communicate the personal data breach to the data subject without undue delay. 2.   The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall describe in clear and plain language the nature of the personal data breach and contain at least the information and measures referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 33(3). 3.   The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 shall not be required if any of the following conditions are met: 4.   If the controller has not already communicated the personal data breach to the data subject, the supervisory authority, having considered the likelihood of the personal data breach resulting in a high risk, may require it to do so or may decide that any of the conditions referred to in paragraph 3 are met. Article 34 GDPR implements the new [ 1 ] obligation of the controller to inform data subjects about a personal data breach (as defined in Article 4(12) GDPR ) where it is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. This obligation to notify data subjects is therefore closely connected to and supplements the controller's independent obligation to notify the relevant supervisory authority (\"SA\") under Article 33 GDPR . See therefore also the Commentary on Article 33 GDPR . [ 2 ] As described there, Article 33 and 34 are also closely linked with Article 32 GDPR which obliges controllers as well as processors to implement appropriate security measures. Further, the assessment of whether a notification of the data subject is necessary (due to the resulting high risk to the rights and freedoms of the natural person) as well as the notification itself should be covered by the controllers respective policy ( Incident Response Plan ) as described in more detail in the commentary on Article 33 GDPR . Paragraph 1 of this provision imposes an obligation on controllers to notify data subjects without undue delay about a personal data breach where such breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Paragraph 2 describes linguistic requirements the information to the data subjects should have (\" clear and plain language \"), its purpose (describing \" the nature of the personal data breach \") and minimum content (contact points, consequences, actions taken or otherwise planned). Paragraph 3 provides for exceptions to the information obligation in specific circumstances. For example, where the controller has implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures to exclude any harm. Finally, paragraph 4 authorises the SA to require the controller to inform the data subjects about a personal data breach in case it did not already did so. Also, the SA might decide that one of the exemptions of Article 34(3) are applicable. EDPB Guidelines: EDPB, 'Guidelines 01/2021 on Examples regarding Personal Data Breach Notification', 14 December 2021 (Version 2.0) ; and EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 9/2022 on personal data breach notification under GDPR\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.0 ). Article 34(1) GDPR obliges the controller to communicate, without undue delay, the personal data breach to data subjects when the breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. This means that not all personal data breaches have to be communicated to the data subjects - not even all personal data breaches have to be reported to the SA under Article 33 GDPR. This provision carries both theoretical and practical importance. On one hand, it acknowledges the individual's subjective right to be informed about the (failed) security of their personal data. On the other hand, it enables data subjects to make strategic choices to safeguard their personal sphere. For example: After learning about a personal data breach involving its phone number, a data subject could swith number or pay more attention when they are contacted in a suspicious way. Similarly, a data subject might decide to close their account with its bank and look for a more secure financial institution after a personal data breach shows significant vulnerabilities of the bank's security measures. Further, a data subject might just block their credit card  after learning that it has been compromised in a personal data breach. The obligation to notify data subjects of a personal data breach stipulated in this provision refers to the notion of a personal data breach defined in Article 4(12) GDPR , i.e. \u201c a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed \u201d. For more information, see commentary on Article 4(12) GDPR . However, as mentioned above, the obligation to communicate the personal data breach to data subjects only arises where there is a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, likely resulting from the personal data breach (see below). [ 3 ] Article 34(1) GDPR differs in an important respect from the obligation to notify the SA about a personal data breach in accordance with Article 33 GDPR . Instead of having to notify the SA of a breach that leads to any kind of risk to data subjects, the controller only has the obligation to communicate a personal data breach to data subjects where it is likely to lead to a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons . The threshold for communicating the breach to data subjects concerned is therefore higher than in Article 33 GDPR . [ 4 ] In any event, the controller needs to perform an assessment considering the risks for data subjects resulting from the personal data breach. For this risk assessment (consideration of the likelihood and severity of the impact of the personal data breach on the rights and freedoms of the data subjects) and the factors to consider, see commentary on Article 33(1) GDPR . \"[...] This risk exists when the breach may lead to physical, material or non-material damage for the individuals whose data have been breached. Examples of such damage are discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss and damage to reputation. When the breach involves personal data that reveals racial or ethnic origin, political opinion, religion or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, or includes genetic data, data concerning health or data concerning sex life, or criminal convictions and offences or related security measures, such damage should be considered likely to occur.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 9/2022 on personal data breach notification under GDPR\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.0), margin number 102. Examples of \" high risk \" situations include, inter alia , a cyberattack on an online marketplace where usernames, passwords and purchase history are made public; a cyberattack on a hospital resulting in medical records being made inaccessible; or where personal data was mistakenly sent to a wrong mailing list (with over a thousand recipients). [ 5 ] The fact that controllers only have to communicate personal data breaches likely resulting in a high risks to natural persons should strike a balance between the controllers interest not to notify data subjects (often customers or business partners) about circumstances that might very well be harmful for their reputation and not overloading data subjects with too much information about only limited risks on the one hand with the necessity to give data subjects the ability to take measures to reduce harm that might result from a personal data breach on the other side. [ 6 ] Controllers might be incentivised to perform this assessment in a way that shows no high risk for data subjects in order to avoid the communication stipulated in this provision. Therefore, the SA has the authority to require the controller to communicate the personal data breach to the affected data subjects. [ 7 ] The obligation set forth in this provision addresses controllers as defined in Article 4(7) GDPR . Please see the commentary on Article 33(1) GDPR on this point including notes on joint-controllership, the relationship with processors and with manufacturers. Its worth highlighting that the processor's obligation in Article 33(2) GDPR to notify controllers \u201c without undue delay \u201d in case they identify a personal data breach is also essential for the controller's obligation to notify data subjects under this provision (see commentary on Article 33(1) and (2) GDPR ). However, the processor is neither obliged to communicate the personal data breach to data subjects, nor supposed to assess the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons; this is the obligation of the controller. [ 8 ] The affected data subjects should be directly notified of the relevant breach by the controller. When communicating a breach to data subjects, dedicated messages should be utilised, separate from regular updates, newsletters, or standard messages. Otherwise the affected data subjects might not realise the relevance of the communication which should be a clear and transparent communication of the personal data breach. [ 9 ] Recital 86 states in this regard that the communication to the data subjects should \" describe the nature of the personal data breach as well as recommendations for the natural person concerned to mitigate potential adverse effects \". In case a direct notification to the affected data subjects would involve an disproportionate effort , the communication of a personal data breach could also be done via public communication or similar measures, ensuring that data subjects are informed in an equally effective manner (see exemption in Article 34(3)(c) GDPR below). [ 10 ] \"Examples of transparent communication methods include direct messaging (e.g. email, SMS, direct message), prominent website banners or notification, postal communications and prominent advertisements in print media. A notification solely confined within a press release or corporate blog would not be an effective means of communicating a breach to an individual. The EDPB recommends that controllers should choose a means that maximizes the chance of properly communicating information to all affected individuals. Depending on the circumstances, this may mean the controller employs several methods of communication, as opposed to using a single contact channel.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 9/2022 on personal data breach notification under GDPR\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.0), margin number 90. Controllers will generally be in the best position to determine the most suitable contact channel and method for communicating a breach to individuals, especially if they have regular interactions with their customers. However, it is crucial for controllers to exercise caution when selecting a contact channel, as using a channel compromised by the breach could potentially enable attackers to impersonate the controller. [ 11 ] The communication should take place in a language understand by the data subjects. This could be the language in which the previous communication with the data subject took place or the local national language of the data subjects. It could be appropriate to provide the communication in various languages. [ 12 ] In some cases, it might also be appropriate for the controller to consult the SA regarding the communication to data subjects about a personal data breach as well as how to formulate an appropriate message and what the most appropriate way would be to contact the affected natural persons. [ 13 ] This could be the case if the controller is unable to assess whether the personal data breach will likely result in a high risk for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. [ 14 ] Moreover, according to Recital 88, the legitimate interests of law-enforcement authorities is also something to consider in case the early disclosure of a personal data breach could unnecessarily hamper investigations connected to the breach. [ 15 ] \"Whenever it is not possible for the controller to communicate a breach to an individual because there is insufficient data stored to contact the individual, in that particular circumstance the controller should inform the individual as soon as it is reasonably feasible to do so (e.g. when an individual exercises their Article 15 right to access personal data and provides the controller with necessary additional information to contact them).\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 9/2022 on personal data breach notification under GDPR\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.0), margin number 96. Article 34(1) GDPR stipulates that controllers must notify data subjects of a data breach \u201c without undue delay \u201d - in other words, given the likelihood of high risks for the data subject (see above), as soon as possible , considering that such a communication should enable data subjects to take individual steps to protect themselves from any negative consequences of the breach of their personal data. [ 16 ] However, Article 34 GDPR does not provide a specific deadline of 72 hours as is the case in Article 33 GDPR ; nevertheless, for more information on the term \"without undue delay\" also compare commentary on Article 33 GDPR. Instead, timelines should be assessed depending on the nature and gravity of the breach itself, the level of risk to natural persons and the need to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures before the communication; e.g. Recital 86 GDPR provides examples of issues to take into account when assessing the timeliness of a notification to data subjects: \u201c the need to mitigate an immediate risk of damage would call for prompt communication with data subjects whereas the need to implement appropriate measures against continuing or similar personal data breaches may justify more time for communication. \u201d Similarly, Recital 88 GDPR indicates that communication to data subjects may be delayed to preserve the integrity of an investigation led by a law-enforcement authority into the circumstances of the breach. [ 17 ] The communication to the data subjects should enable them to take any steps to protect themselves. [ 18 ] Article 34(2) GDPR therefore requires that the communication to the data subject (Article 34(1) GDPR) must contain a description in clear and plain language of the nature of the breach as well as the elements outlined in Article 33(3)(b)-(d) GDPR . Namely, the name and contact details of the data protection officer or other contact point where more information can be obtained; the likely consequences of the data breach; and the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the controller to address the personal data breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. This wording is already used in Article 12(1) GDPR requiring controllers to provide any communication under Articles 13 to 22 and 34 \" in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in particular for any information addressed specifically to a child \". Due to the use of the term \"clear and in plain language\", reference can be made to this provision which is also directly applicable to the communication to affected data subjects under this provision. See therefore commentary on Article 12(1) GDPR . Regarding the language the controller should use for the communication, see commentary on Article 34(1) GDPR above. See commentary on Article 33(3) GDPR which already describes the controller's obligation to provide the SA with \" the nature of the personal data breach including where possible, the categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned and the categories and approximate number of personal data records concerned \". However, it should be noted that the additional elements mentioned there are not required in the communication to the data subjects under Article 34(2) GDPR. This is a reasonable choice since, generally, data subjects do not need to know these specific details in order to make informed decisions regarding the breach. [ 19 ] Article 34(2) GDPR provides for the obligation to include information about the name and contact details of the data protection officer or other contact point where more information can be obtained by referencing to Article 33(3)(a) GDPR. See, therefore, commentary on Article 33(3)(a) GDPR . In case of the communication to the affected data subject, special consideration should be given to the urgent nature of the communication - considering that it is mandatory only in cases of \"high risk\" to the data subject. The contact point for data subject should therefore be easily and directly reachable. Consequently, obstructive methods that, for example, require the requester to navigate complex online systems to establish contact are not permissible at this stage. In such cases, an email address seems more appropriate. Again, reference can be made to commentary on the provision in Article 33(3)(c) GDPR . However, it should be recalled that the communication to the data subject has to use clear and plain language. The use of examples and accessible terminology allows the data subject to immediately understand the risks they are facing and the most appropriate actions to take. For example: An e-commerce platform experiences a cyber attack resulting in the disclosure of user passwords on the web. The communication under Article 34 GDPR should explain to the user, in clear and plain language, that, due to the breach, it will be necessary to change their service password and ensure that the same value is not used to access other services. In such case, the user should be advised to change those passwords as well to prevent further unauthorised access. Also regarding the description of measures taken or proposed to be taken by the controller to address the personal data breach (including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects), reference can be made to the commentary on Article 33(3)(d) GDPR . It should be considered, however, that the information on measures to mitigate the potential adverse effects will probably be especially important for the affected data subjects. As indicated by the phrase \u201c at least \u201d found under Article 34(2) GDPR, this list of information to be provided to data subjects is non-exhaustive. Recital 86 GDPR outlines that the controller \u201cshould \u201d provide \u201c recommendations for the natural person concerned to mitigate potential adverse effects \u201d. The information given to data subjects should therefore enable them to take any \u201c necessary precautions \u201d, which, although not directly mentioned by Article 33(3)(b)-(d) GDPR could be shared as additional information by the controller Article 34(3) GDPR lists three exemptions from the controller\u2019s obligation to communicate the breach to data subjects. It should be noted that, as per the accountability principle, controllers are required to provide evidence to the SA to demonstrate the applicability of one or more of the specified conditions if they rely upon them. The EDPB also notes that, although the communication may not be immediately necessary (if there is no risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals), the situation may evolve over time, and the risk assessment would need to be reassessed accordingly. [ 20 ] \"If a controller decides not to communicate a breach to the individual, Article 34(4) GDPR explains that the supervisory authority can require it to do so, if it considers the breach is likely to result in a high risk to individuals. Alternatively, it may consider that the conditions in Article 34(3) GDPR have been met in which case notification to individuals is not required. If the supervisory authority determines that the decision not to notify data subjects is not well founded, it may consider employing its available powers and sanctions\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 9/2022 on personal data breach notification under GDPR\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.0), margin number 99. The first exception from the obligation to communicate a personal data breach to the affected data subjects is applicable if the controller has implemented appropriate technical and organisational protection measures, and those measures were applied to the personal data affected by the personal data breach. This provision specifically mentions measures that render the personal data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it, such as encryption. In other word, the exception applies if, prior to the breach , the controller had implemented suitable technical and organizational measures to safeguard the personal data. In particular, these measures aim to make the personal data incomprehensible to unauthorized individuals. One effective approach is the use of pseudonymisation, advanced encryption techniques or tokenisation to protect the personal data. These security measures ensure that even if the data is accessed unlawfully, it remains unintelligible and therefore protected. [ 21 ] Since effective pseudonymisation can mitigate adverse effects of data breaches, it may also be considered when assessing the obligations a controller has under Art. 33 and 34 GDPR. In particular, it may be regarded as an appropriate technical and organisational measure that limits the impact of a personal data breach in the sense of Art. 34(3)(a) GDPR. However, the content of data that was accessed without authorisation can still be analysed by the actor who accessed it. Careful analysis is required in this case to establish whether the pseudonymisation has reduced the risks resulting from the data breach sufficiently to render communication of the breach to the affected data subjects unnecessary, Art. 34(1) and (3) GDPR. EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 1/2025 on Pseudonymisation\u2019, 16 January 2025 (Version for public consultation), margin number 62. For example: An unauthorised person got access to a device where highly sensitive personal data are stored. However, the content of such a device in encrypted. Therefore, even if a data breach occurred theoretically entailing high risks for data subject, the obligation under Article 34(1) is not triggered, as the authorised party will not be able to make use of the data obtained. The second exception applies in case the controller has taken subsequent measures ensuring that the high risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects is no longer likely to materialise. \u201c Subsequent \u201d measures should therefore be interpreted as measures, adopted immediately following a personal data breach, which are able to mitigate the likelihood of the high risk to individuals' rights and freedoms from materialising. For instance, in certain situations, the controller may have promptly identified and addressed the unauthorized access to personal data, preventing any further misuse. However, it is essential to consider the potential consequences of a breach of confidentiality, taking into account the nature of the data involved. [ 22 ] In addition, it must be stressed that after a risk actually materialised, the controller can no longer invoke subsequent measures to avoid communication to the data subject. Even if subsequent measures could mitigate damages and reduce further risks, the controller is no longer in the position to evaluate what kind of negative consequences could stem from the original data breach. Therefore, a communication to the people concerned is the most effective way to prevent an even greater impact on their rights and freedoms. [ 23 ] The last exception in this provision applies if the communication of the personal data breach would involve a disproportionate effort. In that case, the controller must instead make a public communication or similar measure whereby the data subjects are informed in an equally effective manner. In other words, in cases where notifying the data subject would require a disproportionate effort, the controller is not obligated to inform the individual. The concept of \" disproportionate effort \" is not explicitly defined in the GDPR. However, it is understood that the effort involved in notifying data subjects relates to the scope of the breach, particularly the number of individuals affected. As the number of affected individuals increases, the communication process becomes proportionally more complex. Nevertheless, since this exception should be interpreted restrictively, the notion of disproportionate effort should be evaluated in relation to the size of the organisation and the availability of technical tools for conducting notifications. In other words, a large-scale controller will be expected to allocate greater resources, including the adoption of electronic communication tools capable of handling the notification burden. In such cases, the effort required cannot be deemed \"disproportionate\". [ 24 ] If the effort is in fact \" disproportionate \", an alternative obligation exists, namely the requirement to publicly disclose the breach, which should be equally effective in ensuring transparency and accountability. The EDPB suggests that \u201c technical arrangements \u201d could nonetheless be taken to ensure that data subjects can access further information upon request. [ 25 ] It is important to highlight that according to Article 23 GDPR , Union or Member State law may restrict the obligations and rights outlined in Article 34 GDPR. As mentioned previously, Article 34(4) GDPR authorises the SA to require the controller to communicate a personal data breach to the affected data subjects in case the controller did not already do so. Moreover, the SA might also decide that any of the conditions listed in Article 33(3) GDPR are met which means that no communication of the personal data breach is necessary. In that regard, it should be recalled that the threshold triggering the communication of a personal data breach to the affected data subjects under Article 34 GDPR is higher than for the notification obligation to the SA under Article 33 GDPR . Therefore, in all cases where a communication to the affected data subjects is necessary, the notification to the SA is also necessary. Thus, since the SA should be aware of the data breach, it can also be involved in the controller\u2019s procedure for communicating the breach to affected data subjects as required under Article 34(1) GDPR. Accordingly, Article 34(4) GDPR suggests that the SA can play a determinative role in indicating that there is a \u201c high risk \u201d to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. It should also be noted that the SA can also provide advice to the controller. This advice can relate to the assessment of the risk to the data subjects or on the method of communicating the breach to data subjects, such as how to identify an adequate channel to notify them, the language to communicate in, and what kind of message to send. [ 26 ] Obviously, this provision only applies in situations in which the controller did not already communicate the breach to the affected data subjects. However, it is questionable to what extent the authority could use its power to require the controller to communicate a personal data breach to the affected data subjects in cases where it considers a prior communication of the controller to be incomplete or insufficient. It would make sense for the SA to also require improved communication in those cases. While Article 33(1) GDPR specifically mentions the SA competent in accordance with Article 55 GDPR regarding the controller's notification obligation, Article 34(4) GDPR only mentions the SA. However, it is reasonable to consider this provision referring to the SA which got notified under Article 33(1) GDPR. In order for the SA to use its power to request the controller to communicate a personal data breach to the affected data subjects, it must consider the likelihood of the data breach resulting in a high risk. Therefore, it can correct a faulty risk assessment by the controller in case the controller came to the conclusion that no high risk for the rights and freedoms of the data subjects are likely to result from the personal data breach. [ 27 ] In such case, the authority can instruct the controller to communicate the breach to the affected data subjects. \"[...] If the supervisory authority determines that the decision not to notify data subjects is not well founded, it may consider employing its available powers and sanctions.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 9/2022 on personal data breach notification under GDPR\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.0), margin number 99. However, the SA is not authorised under this provision to communicate the personal data breach to the affected data subjects directly. [ 28 ] The SA can also decide whether any of the exemptions under Article 34(3) GDPR apply, relieving the controller of its obligation to communicate the personal data breach to affected individuals. This can be very helpful for a controller who is uncertain whether or not one of the exceptions might apply. For example: The notification of the affected data subjects could involve a significant effort and the controller could be uncertain if this could already be considered a disproportionate effort and a public communication of the personal data breach would suffice. A decision by the SA might help to provide the controller with clearity. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 34 GDPR \u2191 There was no equivalent to Article 34 GDPR in the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. Article 17 thereof only required controllers to take adequate measures to protect personal data from breaches.

Decisions 5 References 1.   Where a type of processing in particular using new technologies, and taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall, prior to the processing, carry out an assessment of the impact of the envisaged processing operations on the protection of personal data. A single assessment may address a set of similar processing operations that present similar high risks. 2.   The controller shall seek the advice of the data protection officer, where designated, when carrying out a data protection impact assessment. 3.   A data protection impact assessment referred to in paragraph 1 shall in particular be required in the case of: 4.   The supervisory authority shall establish and make public a list of the kind of processing operations which are subject to the requirement for a data protection impact assessment pursuant to paragraph 1. The supervisory authority shall communicate those lists to the Board referred to in Article 68. 5.   The supervisory authority may also establish and make public a list of the kind of processing operations for which no data protection impact assessment is required. The supervisory authority shall communicate those lists to the Board. 6.   Prior to the adoption of the lists referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5, the competent supervisory authority shall apply the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63 where such lists involve processing activities which are related to the offering of goods or services to data subjects or to the monitoring of their behaviour in several Member States, or may substantially affect the free movement of personal data within the Union. 7.   The assessment shall contain at least: 8.   Compliance with approved codes of conduct referred to in Article 40 by the relevant controllers or processors shall be taken into due account in assessing the impact of the processing operations performed by such controllers or processors, in particular for the purposes of a data protection impact assessment. 9.   Where appropriate, the controller shall seek the views of data subjects or their representatives on the intended processing, without prejudice to the protection of commercial or public interests or the security of processing operations. 10.   Where processing pursuant to point (c) or (e) of Article 6(1) has a legal basis in Union law or in the law of the Member State to which the controller is subject, that law regulates the specific processing operation or set of operations in question, and a data protection impact assessment has already been carried out as part of a general impact assessment in the context of the adoption of that legal basis, paragraphs 1 to 7 shall not apply unless Member States deem it to be necessary to carry out such an assessment prior to processing activities. 11.   Where necessary, the controller shall carry out a review to assess if processing is performed in accordance with the data protection impact assessment at least when there is a change of the risk represented by processing operations. Article 35 GDPR requires the controller to carry out a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) when a certain processing operation (or a set of operations with similar characteristics) presents a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. The performance of a DPIA is therefore an important tool to manage the risks connected to the processing as well as to demonstrate compliance with the respective obligations of the GDPR. [ 1 ] The provisions regarding the performance of a DPIA are closely related to the accountability principle (see also Articles 5(2) and 24 GDPR ). It is also connected to the general risk assessment the controller has to perform under Articles 24 , 25 and 32 GDPR since this risk assessment provides the controller with the information whether the processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. [ 2 ] If the DPIA indicates that the processing results in a high risk, the controller is obliged to consult the DPA regarding the processing operation before it can start with the processing. [ 3 ] Article 35(1) GDPR provides for the general obligation to perform a DPIA prior to the processing in case the processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Article 35(2) GDPR obliges the controller to consult the data protection officer when carrying out a DPIA. Article 35(3) GDPR lists scenarios in which a DPIA needs to be performed. Articles 35(4) to (6) GDPR handle black- and whitelists; i.e. lists provided by DPAs declaring which kind of processing operations are subject to an DPIA. Article 35(7) GDPR lists minimum requirements for the performance of a DPIA. Article 35(8) GDPR provides for the consideration of codes of conducts in the course of the performance of a DPIA. Article 35(9) GDPR requires the controller to consult, where appropriate, data subjects or their representatives on the intended processing. Article 35(10) GDPR exempts certain processing operations based on Union or Member State law from the requirement to perform a DPIA. Finally, Article 35(11) GDPR provides for the controller's obligation to continuously reevaluate a DPIA after it was performed. EDPB and WP29 Guidelines : on this Article, please see WP29, 'Guidelines on Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and determining whether processing is \u201clikely to result in a high risk\u201d for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679' 17/EN WP248 rev.01, 4 April 2017 (available here). A DPIA is necessary whenever controllers intend to conduct processing activities that, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the respective processing are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. This requirement becomes particularly relevant in situations involving the use of new or innovative technologies, for which no previous data protection impact assessment has been conducted or when the existing assessment was performed some time ago, necessitating a fresh evaluation (see Recital 89 of the GDPR). It is the controller\u2019s responsibility to perform a DPIA. Processors and device manufacturers are therefore not responsible for carrying out this analysis. [ 4 ] However, under Article 28(3)(f) GDPR , the processor shall assist the controller by providing any information available to them. The Data Protection Officer (DPO) must also be involved in the drafting of the DPIA under Article 35(2) GDPR and Article 39(1)(c) GDPR , and their advice should be recorded by the controller. Data subjects can also be involved in the preparation of the document, as stipulated by Article 35(9) GDPR. [ 5 ] \"The controller is responsible for ensuring that the DPIA is carried out [...]. Carrying out the DPIA may be done by someone else, inside or outside the organization, but the controller remains ultimately accountable for that task\" WP29, 'Guidelines on Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and determining whether processing is \u201clikely to result in a high risk\u201d for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679' 17/EN WP248 rev.01, 4 April 2017, p. 14. Due to the identical wording, see Commentary on Article 24 GDPR on the interpretation of the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing. In general, the controller has to take into account the details of the processing activity when assessing the risk of the processing activity. Performing a DPIA is not obligatory for every processing operation that may pose risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals. [ 6 ] The requirement for a DPIA arises only when the processing is expected to lead to a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals [ 7 ] . Article 35(3) provides for a list of aspects that are considered to pose a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals and can therefore serve as some kind of benchmark for what the legislator considers a high risk. [ 8 ] \"A 'risk' is a scenario describing an event and its consequences, estimated in terms of severity and likelihood. 'Risk management', on the other hand, can be defined as the coordinated activities to direct and control an organization with regard to risk.\" WP29, 'Guidelines on Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and determining whether processing is \u201clikely to result in a high risk\u201d for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679' 17/EN WP248 rev.01, 4 April 2017, p. 6. The WP29 developed a list of criteria for assessing the high risk involved in certain types of processing, including, among others: the existence of assessment or scoring operations, the presence of automated decision-making, systematic monitoring, the use of special categories of data, the existence of large-scale data processing, matching operations between different databases, personal data relating to vulnerable individuals, the use of new technologies, the fact that the processing may inhibit the data subject from either exercising their rights, or using a particular service. [ 9 ] In the WP29\u2019s view, regardless of the mitigating measures which a controller may adopt, as more of these criteria are met, it will be more likely that the processing will present a high risk for data subjects\u2019 rights and freedoms, and thus require a DPIA. In most cases, when a processing operation meets more than one of this criteria, the controller should consider the processing to pose a high risk and perform a DPIA. However, \" in some cases, a data controller can consider that a processing meeting only one of these criteria requires a DPIA \". Conversely, a processing operation may correspond to the aforementioned cases and still be considered by the controller not to be \u201c likely to result in a high risk \u201d. In such cases \" the controller should justify and document the reasons for not carrying out a DPIA \". However, according to the WP29, in most cases, the meeting of two criteria would suffice to justify a DPIA requirement. [ 10 ] For example: An address publisher plans to collect information on as many data subjects as possible by scraping public sources for data subject's address data. It wants to combine the address data with statistical income and wealth data which is also publicly available and create profiles for each data subject. The controller assumes that informing the data subjects would involve a disproportionate effort and plans to invoke the respective exemption from its information obligation. Since the processing involves, inter alia, an assessment operation, large-scale data processing and the inhibitions of data subjects to exercise their rights due to the lack of information, the controller can be confident that the processing is likely to result in a high risk for the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Therefore, it has to conduct a DPIA. The purpose of a DPIA is to systematically analyse a processing operation that may entail high risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals. Conceptually, a DPIA is a tool through which the controller, potentially supported by a DPO, processor, and other experts, establishes the context of observation (\"taking into account the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing and the sources of the risk\"), assesses the risks of the processing activity (\"assess the particular likelihood and severity of the high risk\"), and identifies ways to manage that risk (\"mitigating that risk\"), ensure the protection of personal data, demonstrate GDPR compliance. [ 11 ] Apart from what is stipulated in Article 35(7) GDPR in terms of content (to which the commentary refers), the GDPR provides data controllers with the flexibility to determine the precise structure and form of the DPIA in order to allow for the DPIA to fit with existing working practices. [ 12 ] However, whatever its form, a DPIA must be a genuine assessment of risks, allowing controllers to take measures to address them. In this view, and in order to ensure consistency, the WP29 has identified a list of \" common criteria \" which \" clarify the basic requirements of the Regulation, but provide enough scope for different forms of implementation. \" [ 13 ] These \"C riteria for an acceptable DPIA \" are the following: a systematic description of the processing is provided (Article 35(7)(a) GDPR): nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing are taken into account (Recital 90); personal data, recipients and period for which the personal data will be stored are recorded; a functional description of the processing operation is provided; the assets on which personal data rely (hardware, software, networks, people, paper or paper transmission channels) are identified; compliance with approved codes of conduct is taken into account (Article 35(8 GDPR)); necessity and proportionality are assessed (Article 35(7)(b) GDPR): measures envisaged to comply with the Regulation are determined (Article 35(7)(d) GDPR and Recital 90), taking into account: measures contributing to the proportionality and the necessity of the processing on the basis of: specified, explicit and legitimate purpose(s) ( Article 5(1)(b) GDPR ); lawfulness of processing ( Article 6 GDPR ); adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary data ( Article 5(1)(c) GDPR ); limited storage duration ( Article 5(1)(e) GDPR ); measures contributing to the rights of the data subjects: information provided to the data subject (Articles 12 , 13 and 14 GDPR); right of access and to data portability (Articles 15 and 20 GDPR); right to rectification and to erasure (Articles 16 , 17 and 19 GDPR); right to object and to restriction of processing (Articles 18 , 19 and 21 ); relationships with processors ( Article 28 GDPR ); safeguards surrounding international transfer(s) ( Chapter V ); prior consultation ( Article 36 GDPR ). measures contributing to the proportionality and the necessity of the processing on the basis of: specified, explicit and legitimate purpose(s) ( Article 5(1)(b) GDPR ); lawfulness of processing ( Article 6 GDPR ); adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary data ( Article 5(1)(c) GDPR ); limited storage duration ( Article 5(1)(e) GDPR ); specified, explicit and legitimate purpose(s) ( Article 5(1)(b) GDPR ); lawfulness of processing ( Article 6 GDPR ); adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary data ( Article 5(1)(c) GDPR ); limited storage duration ( Article 5(1)(e) GDPR ); measures contributing to the rights of the data subjects: information provided to the data subject (Articles 12 , 13 and 14 GDPR); right of access and to data portability (Articles 15 and 20 GDPR); right to rectification and to erasure (Articles 16 , 17 and 19 GDPR); right to object and to restriction of processing (Articles 18 , 19 and 21 ); relationships with processors ( Article 28 GDPR ); safeguards surrounding international transfer(s) ( Chapter V ); prior consultation ( Article 36 GDPR ). information provided to the data subject (Articles 12 , 13 and 14 GDPR); right of access and to data portability (Articles 15 and 20 GDPR); right to rectification and to erasure (Articles 16 , 17 and 19 GDPR); right to object and to restriction of processing (Articles 18 , 19 and 21 ); relationships with processors ( Article 28 GDPR ); safeguards surrounding international transfer(s) ( Chapter V ); prior consultation ( Article 36 GDPR ). risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects are managed (Article 35(7)(c) GDPR; origin, nature, particularity and severity of the risks are appreciated (cf. Recital 84) or, more specifically, for each risk (illegitimate access, undesired modification, and disappearance of data) from the perspective of the data subjects: risks sources are taken into account (Recital 90); potential impacts to the rights and freedoms of data subjects are identified in case of events including illegitimate access, undesired modification and disappearance of data; threats that could lead to illegitimate access, undesired modification and disappearance of data are identified; likelihood and severity are estimated (Recital 90); risks sources are taken into account (Recital 90); potential impacts to the rights and freedoms of data subjects are identified in case of events including illegitimate access, undesired modification and disappearance of data; threats that could lead to illegitimate access, undesired modification and disappearance of data are identified; likelihood and severity are estimated (Recital 90); measures envisaged to treat those risks are determined (Article 35(7)(d) and Recital 90) interested parties are involved: the advice of the DPO is sought (Article 35(2) GDPR); the views of data subjects or their representatives are sought, where appropriate (Article 35(9) GDPR). [ 14 ] Finally, as a matter of good practice, a DPIA should be continuously reviewed and regularly re-assessed (see Commentary on Article 35(11) GDPR). The DPIA should be conducted prior to the processing in accordance with Articles 35(1) and 35(10), as well as Recitals 90 and 93 of the GDPR. This requirement is in line with the principles of data protection by design and by default, as outlined in Article 25 GDPR and Recital 78. The DPIA can serve as a valuable tool to assist in decision-making regarding the processing of personal data. By conducting a DPIA at an early stage, organizations can proactively identify and address any potential risks or privacy concerns associated with the processing activities. [ 15 ] \"The DPIA should be started as early as is practicable in the design of the processing operation even if some of the processing operations are still unknown. Updating the DPIA throughout the lifecycle project will ensure that data protection and privacy are considered and will encourage the creation of solutions which promote compliance. It can also be necessary to repeat individual steps of the assessment as the development process progresses because the selection of certain technical or organizational measures may affect the severity or likelihood of the risks posed by the processing.\" WP29, 'Guidelines on Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and determining whether processing is \u201clikely to result in a high risk\u201d for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679' 17/EN WP248 rev.01, 4 April 2017, p. 14. If the processing began before the GDPR came into force there is logically no possibility of a prior impact assessment. [ 16 ] Regarding the obligation to perform a DPIA for existing processing activities implemented before the GDPR's applicability, see Commentary on Article 35(11) GDPR. In any case, DPIAs should be seen as a continuous process rather than as a one-time exercise. [ 17 ] A DPIA may concern a single data processing operation. However, Article 35(1) states that a single assessment may also address a set of similar processing operations that present similar high risks. Hence, a single DPIA can be utilized to evaluate multiple processing operations that share similarities in terms of their nature, scope, context, purpose, and risks. \"A single DPIA could be used to assess multiple processing operations that are similar in terms of nature, scope, context, purpose, and risks. Indeed, DPIAs aim at systematically studying new situations that could lead to high risks on the rights and freedoms of natural persons, and there is no need to carry out a DPIA in cases (i.e. processing operations performed in a specific context and for a specific purpose) that have already been studied. This might be the case where similar technology is used to collect the same sort of data for the same purposes. For example, a group of municipal authorities that are each setting up a similar CCTV system could carry out a single DPIA covering the processing by these separate controllers, or a railway operator (single controller) could cover video surveillance in all its train stations with one DPIA. This may also be applicable to similar processing operations implemented by various data controllers. In those cases, a reference DPIA should be shared or made publicly accessible, measures described in the DPIA must be implemented, and a justification for conducting a single DPIA has to be provided.\" WP29, 'Guidelines on Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and determining whether processing is \u201clikely to result in a high risk\u201d for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679' 17/EN WP248 rev.01, 4 April 2017, p. 7. Hence, controllers must carry out a DPIA only if the processing \u201c is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons \u201d. Accordingly, a DPIA is not required [ 18 ] when: (i) the processing is not \"likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons\" ; (ii) the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing are very similar to the processing for which a DPIA has been carried out; [ 19 ] (iii) the processing operations have been checked by a Data Protection Authority (DPA) before May 2018 and the specific conditions have not changed (recital 171); [ 20 ] (iv) a processing operation pursuant to Article 6(1)(c) or (e) has a legal basis in EU or Member State law, where the law regulates the specific processing operation, and a DPIA has already been carried out as part of the establishment of that legal basis (Article 35(10) GDPR); [ 21 ] (v) the processing is included on an optional list (established by a DPA) of processing operations for which no DPIA is required (Article 35(5) GDPR). [ 22 ] As per Article 35(1), the responsibility for conducting a DPIA lies with the controller and not with the DPO. However, the DPO can play a crucial and valuable role in supporting the controller during the performance of a DPIA. In line with the principle of data protection by design (see Article 25 GDPR ), Article 35(2) GDPR explicitly states that the controller \" shall seek advice \" from the DPO when performing a DPIA. Accordingly, where an obligation to carry out a DPIA exists and a DPO is appointed, the DPO must be involved in the procedure, and the controller must consult them for their advice. [ 23 ] It should be noted that Article 39(1)(c) GDPR provides for the corresponding duty to the DPO to \"p rovide advice where requested regarding the [DPIA] and monitor its performance pursuant to Article 35 \". [ 24 ] The involvement of the DPO should include (but is not limited to) [ 25 ] determining whether a DPIA is necessary, selecting the appropriate methodology for conducting the assessment, deciding whether to perform it internally or outsource it, identifying safeguards to mitigate risks to data subjects' rights and interests, and ensuring the correct execution of the DPIA in compliance with the GDPR. The DPO's input will regularly provide valuable insights and help ensuring the effectiveness and accuracy of the DPIA process. [ 26 ] The DPO involvement should be documented in writing in order to demonstrate that the advice has been sought. Although the controller is not obliged to follow the DPO\u2019s opinion it should document its reasons if it chooses not to. [ 27 ] Due to the controller's obligation to seek advice from the DPO and the DPO's corresponding duties, it should be considered inadmissible for the controller to delegate the performance of a DPIA to the DPO. [ 28 ] Article 35(3) GDPR provides a list of inherently risky processing operations which always require the performance of a DPIA. This is the case when a processing operation involves: a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural persons which is based on automated processing, including profiling, and on which decisions are based that produce legal effects concerning the natural person or similarly significantly affect the natural person; processing on a large scale of special categories of data referred to in Article 9(1) GDPR , or of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10 GDPR ; or a systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale. The use of the phrase \" in particular \" means that the above-mentioned circumstances, however, do not constitute an exhaustive list and a DPIA may also be required for other types of processing, likely to result in a high risk for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, which are not mentioned in the list provided in this provision. [ 29 ] If one of the criteria listed in Article 35(3) GDPR applies to a processing operation, a DPIA is necessary to assess and mitigate the potential risks to individuals' rights and freedoms. Based on these specific examples of high-risk processing operations, the WP29 has developed a list of criteria to assess such likelihood of high-risk (see Commentary on Article 35(1) GDPR for this list established by the WP29). The first characteristic that makes an processing operation inherently risky, is a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural persons which is based on automated processing, including profiling [ 30 ] , and on which decisions are based that produce legal effects concerning the natural person or similarly significantly affect the natural person. This example is closely related to automated individual decision making under Article 22(1) GDPR [ 31 ] and is particularly relevant for profiling, evaluations and predicting based on aspects concerning the data subject's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences or interests, reliability or behavior, location or movements. [ 32 ] An example of this could include a financial institution that screens its customers against a credit reference database or against an anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CTF) or fraud database. Another example is a biotechnology company offering genetic tests directly to consumers in order to assess and predict the disease/health risks, or a company building behavioural or marketing profiles based on usage or navigation on its website. [ 33 ] However, it should be noted that this example refers to the systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects. [ 34 ] The WP29 interprets systematic as meaning one or more of the following: occurring according to a system; pre-arranged, organised or methodical; taking place as part of a general plan for data collection; or carried out as part of a strategy. [ 35 ] The criteria of extensive ness implies that profiling based on one single aspect of a data subject might not be sufficient to result in a high-risk of a processing operation. [ 36 ] The second example of a characteristic that confers high risk to a processing operation is the processing on a large scale of special categories of data referred to in Article 9(1) GDPR , or of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10 GDPR . Regarding the categories of data, reference can be made to Articles 9 and 10 GDPR , providing for the relevant definitions. However, it is unclear, when a processing operation should be considered to be large scale . This should be considered by the controller on a case to case basis. [ 37 ] \"[T]he WP29 recommends that the following factors, in particular, be considered when determining whether the processing is carried out on a large scale: a. the number of data subjects concerned, either as a specific number or as a proportion of the relevant population; b. the volume of data and/or the range of different data items being processed; c. the duration, or permanence, of the data processing activity; d. the geographical extent of the processing activity.\" WP29, 'Guidelines on Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and determining whether processing is \u201clikely to result in a high risk\u201d for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679' 17/EN WP248 rev.01, 4 April 2017, p. 10. Lastly, another characteristic that makes a processing operation inherently risky is the systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale. Regarding the criterium of the large scale of such processing, see commentary on Article 35(3)(b) GDPR. For the qualification of a processing operation as systematic, see Commentary on Article 35(3)(a) GDPR. \"This type of monitoring is a criterion because the personal data may be collected in circumstances where data subjects may not be aware of who is collecting their data and how they will be used. Additionally, it may be impossible for individuals to avoid being subject to such processing in public (or publicly accessible) space(s).\" WP29, 'Guidelines on Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and determining whether processing is \u201clikely to result in a high risk\u201d for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679' 17/EN WP248 rev.01, 4 April 2017, p. 9. A area should be considered publicly accessible in case it is open to the public, i.e. it can (and is designated to) be accessed by an unknown number of individuals. [ 38 ] Article 35(4) GDPR requires [ 39 ] DPAs to establish and make public a list of the kind of processing operations which are subject to the requirement for a data protection impact assessment pursuant to Article 35(1) GDPR. Such lists of processing operations drafted by DPAs requiring the performance of a DPIA are commonly referred to as \"blacklists \" or \"positive lists\". [ 40 ] This lists describe processing operations which, in the view of the respective DPA pose a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons and always require the performance of a DPIA. [ 41 ] Such list must be communicated by the DPA to the EDPB in accordance with Article 68 GDPR . The DPA's corresponding task can be found in Article 57(1)(k) GDPR . [ 42 ] Blacklists established by DPAs are available online on the EDPB's website. [ 43 ] However, if a processing operation is not included in a list in accordance with this provision, or in case the DPA does not draft or publish such list, this does not mean (and has no indicative value in this regard) that the processing operation does not pose a high risk and that no DPIA has to be performed. [ 44 ] The consistency mechanism described in Article 35(6) GDPR must be applied in the cases listed in Article 35(6) GDPR; i.e. if such lists involve processing activities which are related to the offering of goods or services to data subjects or to the monitoring of their behaviour in several Member States, or may substantially affect the free movement of personal data within the Union. [ 45 ] Article 35(5) GDPR provides for the option of the DPA to establish and make public a list of the kind of processing operations for which no data protection impact assessment is required. Such list is commonly referred to as \"whitelist\" or \"negative list\". [ 46 ] While this provision is similar to the DPA's obligation to draft a blacklist (see Article 34(4) GDPR), drafting and publishing a whitelist is not an obligation of the DPA. [ 47 ] However, if the DPA establishes and makes public such a list, it is required to communicate the list to the EDPB (see respective obligation in Article 35(4) GDPR). As it is the case for a blacklist, the fact that a processing operation is not included in a whitelist (or that the DPA did not establish a whitelist) does not mean that such processing operation poses a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. [ 48 ] Where a DPA draws up such a negative list, attention should be paid to the detailed description of the processing operations so that the controller does not run the risk of misunderstanding the entries and thus refrains from carrying out the data protection impact assessment and possibly also taking the necessary remedial measures despite a likely high risk. [ 49 ] Just as in case of blacklists, the consistency mechanism described in Article 35(6) GDPR must be applied for white lists as well if said list contains processing operations falling under Article 35(6) GDPR (i.e. if such lists involve processing activities which are related to the offering of goods or services to data subjects or to the monitoring of their behaviour in several Member States, or may substantially affect the free movement of personal data within the Union). [ 45 ] In case the lists referred to in Article 35(4) and (5) GDPR involve processing activities which are related to the offering of goods or services to data subjects, or to the monitoring of their behaviour in several Member States, or may substantially affect the free movement of personal data within the Union, The competent DPA shall communicate the list to the EDPB and apply the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63 GDPR prior to the adoption of the respective list. It should be noted that the corresponding provision in the GDPR's section on the consistency mechanism only specifically lists the adoption of a list of the processing operations subject to the requirement for a DPIA pursuant to Article 35(4) GDPR (i.e. blacklists). [ 50 ] However, any DPA can refer to Article 64(2) GDPR, in order to request an opinion of the EDPB. [ 51 ] Article 35(7) GDPR sets out a list of minimum requirements which shall be dealt with in the DPIA. According to this provision, the DPIA must contain at least: a systematic description of the envisaged processing operations and the purposes of the processing, including, where applicable, the legitimate interest pursued by the controller (Article 35(7)(a) GDPR); an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing operations in relation to the purposes (Article 35(7)(b) GDPR); an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in Article 35(1) GDPR (Article 35(7)(c) GDPR); and the measures envisaged to address the risks, including safeguards, security measures and mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal data and to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation taking into account the rights and legitimate interests of data subjects and other persons concerned (Article 35(7)(d) GDPR). To begin with, under Article 35(7)(a) GDPR, the assessment must provide a systematic description of the envisaged processing operations and its purposes. In practice, this first step includes the description of the data flow and the systematic indication of the legal basis of the processing, including any legitimate interests pursued by the controller. This description should also include the area of application of the envisaged processing and the controller's relationship with the data subjects. [ 52 ] In accordance with Article 35(7)(b) GDPR, the assessment will then have to ponder and explain the necessity and proportionality of each processing with regard to each purpose pursued. The controller shall explain for which reason a processing, or a set of processing activities, is necessary to pursue a specific purpose. In doing so, it also has to justify why other less intrusive processing is not suitable for the purpose. Article 35(7)(c) GDPR requires the controller to include an assessment of the risks to the data subjects\u2019 rights and freedoms. A \u201crisk\u201d is a scenario describing an event and its consequences, estimated in terms of severity and likelihood. [ 53 ] Risks can exist both within the controller's organization (e.g. employees, trainees, consultants) as well as externally (e.g. hackers, suppliers), and do not have to be caused exclusively by humans (e.g. harmful computer code, animals, fire, natural disasters). An individual risk is calculated by comparing the potential damage with the probability of its occurrence. [ 54 ] It is generally possible to distinguish between \u201cimplied risk\u201d and \u201cresidual risk\u201d. The former refers to the probability of detrimental consequences if no preventive measures are taken by the controller. The latter, on the contrary, is related to the negative impacts which may still occur despite the fact that certain mitigation measures may have been adopted. [ 55 ] Under Article 35(7)(d) GDPR, the DPIA must include the appropriate measures the controller has adopted to mitigate potential risks. These measures may be technical or organisational in nature, including legal safeguards arising from contracts or other legal sources. The controller shall then apply these measures to the previously identified risks and verify the extent to which they contribute to risk reduction. This makes it possible to calculate the aforementioned 'residual risk'. [ 56 ] The DPIA must be documented, otherwise the controller would not be able to \"systematically describe\" the envisaged processing (Article 35(7)(a) GDPR) or share the assessment with the data protection authority under Article 36 GDPR . In general, the written form is the only way to provide proof of compliance. The GDPR does not explicitly require the publication of the assessment. However, in the interest of transparency towards data subjects, the essential parts of the DPIA can and should be published, or at least made available to the interested parties. [ 57 ] Finally, Article 35(7) GDPR does not provide specific guidance on the structure, content and methodology the DPIA should follow. Nevertheless, in order to facilitate the controller's task, some DPAs have provided DPIA templates. [ 58 ] Although there is no obligation to use any of these models, they may serve as useful methodological or content related guides. It is worth noticing that the choice of measures mitigating risks could in practice lead the controller to change the nature of the processing operations. In this case, it is reasonable to argue that the controller should perform all the steps described in Article 35(7) again, as the new processing is substantially different from the one originally envisaged. [ 59 ] Compliance with approved codes of conduct referred to in Article 40 GDPR shall be taken into due account in assessing the impact of the processing operations performed by the relevant controllers or processors, in particular for the purposes of a DPIA. Although adhering to an approved code of conduct does not automatically guarantee sufficient risk reduction for processing activities in specific cases, it does, however, make it significantly easier to conduct a DPIA and demonstrate compliance with GDPR. [ 60 ] This provisions is based on the idea that it might be easier for associations or organisations representing a whole sector to assess the risks and find appropriate safeguards then for each controller to perform such assessment completely on its own. [ 61 ] For example, it could be easier to consult with data subjects when this is done in a coordinated manner for a whole sector. \"Compliance with a code of conduct (Article 40) has to be taken into account (Article 35(8)) when assessing the impact of a data processing operation. This can be useful to demonstrate that adequate measures have been chosen or put in place, provided that the code of conduct is appropriate to the processing operation. Certifications, seals and marks for the purpose of demonstrating compliance with the GDPR of processing operations by controllers and processors (Article 42), as well as Binding Corporate Rules (BCR), should be taken into account as well.\" WP29, 'Guidelines on Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and determining whether processing is \u201clikely to result in a high risk\u201d for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679' 17/EN WP248 rev.01, 4 April 2017, p. 16. Under Article 35(9) GDPR, the controller, where appropriate, may seek the views of data subjects or their representatives on the intended processing . The reference to the data subjects is to be understood as referring to the data subjects potentially subject to the envisioned processing operation. [ 62 ] Representatives could be, for example, workers and staff councils, trade unions, consumer protection associations or civil society groups. Unless there is a legal or contractual obligation of the data subject to participate in this process, it it up to the controller to ensure participation of the data subjects in order to consider their views. [ 63 ] \"[Data subjects'] views could be sought through a variety of means, depending on the context (e.g. a generic study related to the purpose and means of the processing operation, a question to the staff representatives, or usual surveys sent to the data controller\u2019s future customers) ensuring that the controller has a lawful basis for processing any personal data involved in seeking such views. Although it should be noted that consent to processing is obviously not a way for seeking the views of the data subjects\". WP29, 'Guidelines on Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and determining whether processing is \u201clikely to result in a high risk\u201d for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679' 17/EN WP248 rev.01, 4 April 2017, p. 15. The controller is only obliged to seek the view of data subjects (or their representatives) in case, where appropriate . This leaves it rather open, when the controller is actually obliged to consult data subjects and when this is simply voluntary. [ 64 ] The controller has some level of discretion in this regard. However, in case the controller has no other means to effectively consider the view of data subjects, it should be required to initiate such a consultation. [ 65 ] If the controller decides not to seek the view of data subjects, the controller should document its respective justification and how it assessed that the consultation of data subjects would be not appropriate, e.g. because doing so would compromise the confidentiality of companies\u2019 business plans, or would be disproportionate or impracticable. [ 66 ] In particular, this provisions states that the consultation of data subjects and their representatives is without prejudice to the protection of commercial or public interests or the security of processing operations. Therefore, the protection of those interests could limit the scope of information the controller provides to data subjects or their representatives in course of such a consultation, or the controller considers the interests when evaluating whether the consultation of data subjects is appropriate. [ 67 ] However, its on the controller to find a balance between their interest in confidentiality and the data subjects' capability to provide their view on the envisioned processing operation. [ 68 ] Similarly unclear is how the controller has to consider the data subject's view in the performance of the DPIA after it consulted them. [ 69 ] The WP29 working group highlights that the controller should document its reasons for going ahead (or not going ahead) in case this decision differs from the views of the consulted data subjects. [ 70 ] In case a processing operation is based on Article 6(1)(c) or (e) GDPR (i.e. compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject to, or performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller) and the respective law the controller is subject to regulates the specific processing operation or set of operations in question, and a DPIA has already been carried out as part of a general impact assessment in the context of the adoption of that legal basis, Article 35(1) to (7) GDPR do not apply. In other words, there is no obligation to conduct a DPIA when the processing relies on Article 6(1)(c) or (e) GDPR as a legal basis, which in turn is based on European or Member State law for which the lawmaker has already conducted a general impact assessment (see also Recital 93 GDPR). In this regard, the lawmaker can effectively shift the DPIA to the law-making process, in order to reduce the resulting bureaucracy for public institutions relying on these laws to carry out their processing activities. [ 71 ] However, the lawmaker is not obliged to do so, and can still require controllers to carry out their own DPIA despite having already conducted one during the law-making process. In such cases, the exemption provided in this provision does not apply. The fact that the exemption in this provision only lists Article 35(1) to (7) GDPR as inapplicable leaves some doubt regarding the application of Article 35(8), (9) and (11) GDPR in such cases. While some consider that this provisions similarly do not apply in case the requirements in this provision are met, [ 72 ] it can also be argued that (i) codes of conduct should still be taken into account (Article 35(8) GDPR), (ii) the view of data subjects or their representatives should still be considered (Article 35(9) GDPR), and (iii) a continues monitoring, whether the processing is performed in accordance with the DPIA must be performed (Article 35(11) GDPR). [ 73 ] Article 35(11) GDPR requires the controller to reassess if the processing is performed in accordance with the DPIA. This requirement is supposed to ensure that the DPIA not just produces paperwork but that it is actually implemented in lived in practice. [ 74 ] Therefore, carrying out a DPIA is an continual ongoing process and not a one-time exercise, especially where a processing operation or the underlying risks are dynamic and subject to change. [ 75 ] However, the fact that the DPIA may need to be updated once the processing has actually started is not a valid reason for postponing or not carrying out a DPIA. [ 75 ] \"[I]t should be noted that the revision of a DPIA is not only useful for continuous improvement, but also critical to maintain the level of data protection in a changing environment over time.\" WP29, 'Guidelines on Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and determining whether processing is \u201clikely to result in a high risk\u201d for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679' 17/EN WP248 rev.01, 4 April 2017, p. 14. While the wording of the provision (\"where necessary\") implies that a review of a DPIA is not always necessary, such an evaluation is required, at least , when there is a change of the risk represented by the processing operation. For example, such a change of the risk could be the result of technological development (e.g. change in the state of the art of encryption technology). But also changes in the in the regulatory assessment (e.g. amendments in applicable legal provisions or changes in the case law) could trigger the obligation to reassess a DPIA. [ 76 ] In order to identify any changes requiring a reassessment of the DPIA, the controller needs to continuously monitor the processing activities. Such an obligation for the continuous monitoring of the processing activity is provided in Article 24 GDPR , irrespective of the requirement to perform a DPIA. [ 77 ] In any case, the reassessment of a DPIA should not be limited to the question whether the processing operation is performed in accordance with the DPIA. Rather, the DPIA itself should be reassessed; e.g. the assessment could show that other or further mitigating measures are necessary. [ 78 ] Finally, the obligation to continuously reassess a DPIA leads to the conclusion that a DPIA is also required for processing activities implemented before the GDPR was applicable.

Decisions 5 References 1.   The controller shall consult the supervisory authority prior to processing where a data protection impact assessment under Article 35 indicates that the processing would result in a high risk in the absence of measures taken by the controller to mitigate the risk. 2.   Where the supervisory authority is of the opinion that the intended processing referred to in paragraph 1 would infringe this Regulation, in particular where the controller has insufficiently identified or mitigated the risk, the supervisory authority shall, within period of up to eight weeks of receipt of the request for consultation, provide written advice to the controller and, where applicable to the processor, and may use any of its powers referred to in Article 58. That period may be extended by six weeks, taking into account the complexity of the intended processing. The supervisory authority shall inform the controller and, where applicable, the processor, of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request for consultation together with the reasons for the delay. Those periods may be suspended until the supervisory authority has obtained information it has requested for the purposes of the consultation. 3.   When consulting the supervisory authority pursuant to paragraph 1, the controller shall provide the supervisory authority with: 4.   Member States shall consult the supervisory authority during the preparation of a proposal for a legislative measure to be adopted by a national parliament, or of a regulatory measure based on such a legislative measure, which relates to processing. 5.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, Member State law may require controllers to consult with, and obtain prior authorisation from, the supervisory authority in relation to processing by a controller for the performance of a task carried out by the controller in the public interest, including processing in relation to social protection and public health. Article 36 GDPR obliges the controller to consult the Data Protection Authority (DPA) in case a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) performed in accordance with Article 35 GDPR indicates that a processing operation would result in a high risk in the absence of measures taken by the controller to mitigate the risk. This consultation with the DPA is referred to as \"prior consultation\". The prior consultation is therefore closely connected to the provisions regarding the general risk assessment by the controller (see Article 24 , 25 and 32 GDPR), the performance of a DPIA ( Article 35 GDPR ) and is in stark contrast to the former concept in the Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC) which imposed a general obligation to notify the DPA of processing operation involving personal data. The rationale behind the earlier provision was that the DPAs would conduct an assessment prior to the start of the processing operation and thereby manage certain potentially high risks. However, this general notification obligation did not always lead to a higher level of protection of personal data, and instead produced significant administrative and financial burdens. [ 1 ] Therefore, this provision is an expression of the of the risk based approach visible in some of the provisions of the GPDR as well as of the principle of accountability in Article 5(2) GDPR . [ 2 ] It should be pointed out that the practical relevance of this provisions seems to be quite limited. [ 3 ] Article 36 GDPR further provides for some procedural aspects regarding the prior consultation; e.g. it lists information the controller has to provide to the DPA when consulting it as well as deadlines for the DPA in which it has to respond to the controller with guidance regarding the processing operation. It should also be noted that Article 36 GDPR provides for some provisions not directly connected to the performance of a DPIA. On the one hand, it obliges Member States to consult with DPAs when preparing a proposal for a legislative measure which relates to processing. On the other hand, Article 36 GDPR encompasses an opening clause, allowing Member States to require a prior consultation and even authorisation by the DPA in certain processing situations. Article 36(1) GDPR provides for the controller's obligation to consult the DPA prior to processing where the DPIA indicates that the processing would result in a high risk. Article 36(2) GDPR addresses the DPA which has to provide the controller, and where applicable the processor, with written guidance in case it is of the opinion that the intended processing evaluated by a DPIA would infringe the GDPR. Further, the DPA may use any of its powers under Article 58 GDPR . Article 36(2) GDPR also also provides for a deadline for the DPA of 8 weeks, which can be extended by six weeks and can be suspended in case the controller fails to provide information requested by the DPA. Article 36(3) GDPR clarifies the elements that the controller must provide when consulting the supervisory authority. These include the roles assigned to any joint controllers or processors, the purposes and methods of the processing, measures and safeguards taken to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects, the contact details of the data protection officer (DPO), the DPIA itself, as well as any other information requested by the DPA. Article 36(4) GDPR imposes on Member States an obligation to consult the supervisory authority when adopting legislative measures involving the processing of personal data or a regulatory measure based on the law. Finally, Article 36(5) GDPR allows Member States to subject certain controllers to prior consultation and even authorization, irrespective of the requirements of Article 36(1) GDPR (i.e. the high residual risk after the performance of a DPIA). However, this opening clause is limited to the processing by a controller for the performance of a task carried out by the controller in the public interest, including processing in relation to social protection and public health. EDPB and WP29 Guidelines : on this Article, please see WP29, 'Guidelines on Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and determining whether processing is \u201clikely to result in a high risk\u201d for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679' 17/EN WP248 rev.01, 4 April 2017 (available here ). Article 36(1) GDPR\u00a0 establishes an obligation for the controller to consult the DPA if the DPIA indicates that the processing would result in a high risk in the absence of measures taken by the controller to mitigate the risk. Addressee of the obligation to perform a prior consultation under Article 36(1) GDPR is the controller for the involved processing operation. [ 4 ] This means that, similar to the prior performance of the DPIA, neither the processor nor the controller's DPO are responsible for the conducting the prior consultation with the DPA. However, where applicable, both should support the controller not just in conducting the DPIA but also in course of the DPA's consultation. [ 5 ] In particular, in accordance with Article 39(1)(e) GDPR , the controller's DPO has to act as the contact point for the DPA on issues relating to the prior consultation. However, the responsibility to consult with the DPA continues to lie with the controller. [ 6 ] In case of joint controllership (see Article 26 GDPR ), each joint controller is obliged to consult the DPA in accordance with this provision. [ 7 ] \"Every DPIA must include measures envisaged to address the risks, including safeguards, security measures and mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal data, and to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR taking into account the rights and legitimate interests of data subjects and other persons concerned. If the identified risks cannot be sufficiently addressed (i.e. the residual risks remain high), the joint controllers are each responsible for ensuring a prior consultation with the relevant supervisory authorities.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 8/2020 on the targeting of social media users\u2019, 13 April 2021 (Version 2.0), margin number 110. Obviously, the joint controller should act in a coordinated manner and implement provisions in the joint controllership agreement dealing with the performance of a DPIA as well as the DPA's potential prior consultation. [ 8 ] The controller should consult the DPA competent for the controller in accordance with Article 55 GDPR . [ 9 ] In most cases, the DPA competent for the controller's establishment will be competent; however, in case the controller has no establishment in the Union, a reasonable approach would be in considering the rules set fourth in Article 27 GDPR regarding the appointment of a representative of the controller. [ 10 ] Under Article 36(1), the controller needs to consult the DPA after having conducted a DPIA but prior to processing. Due to the identical wording, see Commentary on Article 35(1) GDPR . However, there can be exceptional cases when a controller needs to consult the DPA after the start of the processing operation. Such a situation could occur when technical or organisational changes alter the risk assessment and lead to residual risks which cannot be mitigated by the controller. [ 11 ] Article 36(1) GDPR requires the DPA's prior consultation in case the DPIA performed by the controller \" indicates that the processing would result in a high risk in the absence of measures taken by the controller to mitigate the risk \". This wording is problematic as it is unclear, how the mitigating measures implemented by the controller should be considered during the assessment of the resulting risk. On the one hand, this provision seems to imply that the consultation should always take place whenever a high risk is indicated by the DPIA, irrespective of the measures and safeguards incorporated by the controller to mitigate these risks in this assessment (ie. in their \u201c absence \u201d). [ 12 ] In other words, the obligation would also apply, in case the controller has taken sufficient risk mitigation measures capable to reduce the processing operation's risk to an acceptable level. [ 13 ] On the other hand, an interpretation of this provision could also lead to the conclusion that a prior consultation is only required when the high risk cannot be mitigated through appropriate\u00a0measures . [ 14 ] This interpretation is supported by Recital 94 GDPR according to which a prior consultation is necessary when \" a data protection impact assessment indicates that the processing would, in the absence of safeguards, security measures and mechanisms to mitigate the risk, result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons and the controller is of the opinion that the risk cannot be mitigated by reasonable means in terms of available technologies and costs of implementation \". The Article 29 Working Party (WP29) further elaborates on this point, clarifying that the controller is required to consult the DPA in case the controller cannot find sufficient measures to reduce the risks to an acceptable level, with the effect that the residual risks are still high. [ 15 ] \"Whenever the data controller cannot find sufficient measures to reduce the risks to an acceptable level (i.e. the residual risks are still high), consultation with the supervisory authority is required.\" WP29, 'Guidelines on Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and determining whether processing is \u201clikely to result in a high risk\u201d for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679' 17/EN WP248 rev.01, 4 April 2017, p. 19 footnotes omitted. For example: A controller plans to implement a new processing activity and first conducts a general risk assessment of the envisaged processing activity. Since the risk assessment showed that the processing activity is likely to result in a high risk for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller performed a DPIA in accordance with Article 35 GDPR. During the DPIA, the controller considered various mitigating measures substantially reducing the risk connected to the processing activity. Therefore, the controller considers that the obligation to consult the DPA prior to the processing does not apply for the planned processing activity. Therefore, there are essentially two conditions for the application of the rules. First, the processing must present a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject as defined in Articles 35(1) , (3) and (4) GDPR . Second, after a DPIA has been carried out, the controller cannot find reasonable and sufficient\u00a0mitigating measures\u00a0to bring the risk to an acceptable level. It may of course be the case that, from a technical point of view, no containment measures exist. [ 16 ] However, it may also happen that some measures exist but the controller decides not to adopt them because they are, according to the controller, economically unfeasible. [ 17 ] In both cases, the prior consultation procedure is triggered and the DPA must provide guidance to the controller. In addition, the DPA may adopt further measures under Article 58 GDPR , such as the prohibition of the processing. In this case, that may be understood as a second, merely potential phase, the prior consultation procedure de facto works as an authorisation. [ 18 ] \"An example of an unacceptable high residual risk includes instances where the data subjects may encounter significant, or even irreversible, consequences, which they may not overcome (e.g.: an illegitimate access to data leading to a threat on the life of the data subjects, a layoff, a financial jeopardy) and/or when it seems obvious that the risk will occur (e.g.: by not being able to reduce the number of people accessing the data because of its sharing, use or distribution modes, or when a well-known vulnerability is not patched).\" WP29, 'Guidelines on Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and determining whether processing is \u201clikely to result in a high risk\u201d for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679' 17/EN WP248 rev.01, 4 April 2017, p. 19. According to Article 36(2) GDPR, where the DPA is of the opinion that the intended processing referred to in Article 36(1) GDPR would infringe the GDPR, in particular where the controller has insufficiently identified or mitigated the risk, the DPA has to provide written advice to the controller within eight weeks, which can be extended by another six weeks if the processing operation is especially complex. The DPA shall inform the controller and, where applicable, the processor, of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request for consultation together with the reasons for the delay. In application of Article 36(1) GDPR, the controller's obligation regarding the prior consultation is triggered when there is a remaining risk after the implementation of measures (see above). However, for the DPA's consideration, it first has to assess whether the intended processing, subject to the DPIA and prior consultation, would infringe the GDPR, in particular in case the controller has insufficiently identified or mitigated the risk. In other words, in a first step, the DPA assesses whether the controller correctly assessed the risk of the processing operation and considered sufficient mitigating measures. [ 19 ] Therefore, the subject of the DPA's assessment is compliance of the processing operation with the GDPR; i.e. the DPA's assessment is not limited to evaluating the controller's risk assessment and considered mitigation measures. [ 20 ] On the contrary, the authority can assess whether the indicated processing is fully compliant with the entire GDPR. While the question whether the controller has insufficiently identified and mitigated the risk will often be central to such assessment, the scope of the assessment can also extend to compliance with the processing principles outlined in Article 5 GDPR and any other specific requirements imposed by the GDPR. These include transparency obligations (Articles 13 and 14 GDPR), the ability to exercise data subject rights (Articles 15 - 22 GDPR), and any other elements mandated by the GDPR. [ 21 ] In context of the mitigation measures, the DPA must look at the latest available technologies that would help mitigate the risks. [ 22 ] In addition, the DPA would need to look at the broader societal context of the processing operation and decide whether the potentially high risks it entails are proportionate even\u00a0when appropriate (even if not sufficient) mitigation measures have been adopted, or according to the interests at stake (for e.g. an underlying public or private interest, and no objective possibility of mitigation). [ 23 ] If the DPA considers the intended processing to infringe the GDPR, it has to provide the controller, and where applicable the processor, with written advice. Further, it may use any of its powers under Article 58 GDPR . The use of a written form for the DPA's advice allows for later verification of the complete implementation by the controller, ensuring compliance with the DPA's guidance. A contested point about the nature of the consultation procedure is whether the advice of the DPA is indeed merely an advice, or whether it can be seen as an approval on moving forward with the processing operation. [ 24 ] The use of the term \" advice \", however, leaves little doubt in this respect. Therefore, although the submission of the consultation must be carried out before the processing starts, it does not actually prevent the controller from carrying out the processing despite the high risks involved. [ 25 ] The controller is free to ignore\u00a0 the advice received in the consultation, but assumes all responsibility if the DPA subsequently decides to sanction it for an eventual violation related to the processing it was advised on. [ 26 ] However, the practical relevance of the matter is limited. Under Article 36(2) GDPR, the DPA may, in fact, exercise any power provided under Article 58 GDPR in addition to providing advice. This includes the possibility of imposing measures such as blocking processing activities in the case of particularly significant violations. Therefore, the practical enforceability of the advice depends on any additional actions that the authority decides to take. The DPA has to respond to the consultation within an eight-week period, starting with the controller's request to conduct a prior consolidation. [ 27 ] Such timeframe represents a compromise in the consultation process. On one hand, the DPA needs a certain amount of time to make its assessment. On the other hand, the data controller has an interest in receiving a prompt response, as delays can have economic implications. [ 28 ] The DPA may be granted a six-week extension if the activities are particularly complex, which can often be the case when new technologies are involved. However, if the DPA extends its deadline, it must inform the controller within one month. These deadlines may be suspended until the supervisory authority has obtained all the necessary information it requested. Article 36(3) GDPR specifies the information the controller has to provide the DPA when in initiates a prior consultation under Article 36 GDPR. Specifically, this is: the responsibilities of the controller, joint controllers and processors involved in the processing, where applicable and in particular for processing within a group of undertakings (Article 36(3)(a) GDPR); the purposes and means of the intended processing (Article 36(3)(b) GDPR); the measures and safeguards provided to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects, including all technical, organisational or legal safeguards that mitigate the risks of processing (Article 36(3)(c) GDPR); the contact details of the DPO if the controller appointed one (Article 36(3)(d) GDPR); a copy of the DPIA (Article 36(3)(e) GDPR); as well as any other information requested by the DPA (Article 36(3)(f) GDPR). Hoever, it should be noted that, as per Article 36(3)(f) GDPR this is cannot be considered comprehensive since the DPA can always request further information. Generally, the information the controller compiles in accordance with Article 35(7) GDPR during the performance of the DPIA will include all the listed information. [ 29 ] It should be recalled that tin accordance with Article 39(1)(e) GDPR the DPO, if one is appointed by the controller, acts as the contact point throughout the consultation process. Article 36(4) GDPR provides for a different scenario for the consultation of the DPA. According to this provisions, Member States must consult the DPA during the preparation of a proposal for a legislative measure to be adopted by a national parliament, or of a regulatory measure based on such a legislative measure, which relates to processing. In other words, when preparing a proposal for primary or secondary legislation under national law related to processing, Member States have to carry out a prior consultation process with the DPA. However, this procedure is different in nature and scope than the one in Article 36(1) GDPR, since it involves the law maker and not controllers, and it could be related to processing operations which do not necessarily result in high risks for data subjects\u2019 rights and freedoms. As a matter of fact, unlike Article 36(1) GDPR, the text of the provision does not mention any \"high risk\" for the rights and freedoms of data subjects as a requirement for this consultation obligation. Furthermore, from a procedural perspective, it is not subject to the same deadline of Article 36(2) GDPR, and it is still disputed whether the outcome of the procedure rather resembles that of Article 58(3)(a) GDPR (i.e. advising controllers in accordance with the prior consultation procedure referred to in Article 36 GDPR) or Article 58(3)(b) GDPR (i.e. issuing, on request, opinions to the national parliament, the Member State government or in accordance with Member State law, to other institutions and bodies as well as to the public on any issue related to the protection of personal data). [ 30 ] This provision is particularly relevant in case the national legislator utilises an opening clause of the GDPR or regulates specific processing situations under Chapter IX of the GDPR. [ 31 ] Article 36(1) GDPR provides for an opening clause, allowing Member State law to require controllers to consult with, and obtain prior authorisation from, the supervisory authority in relation to processing by a controller for the performance of a task carried out by the controller in the public interest, including processing in relation to social protection and public health. Unlike the obligatory consultation process under Article 36(1) GDPR such a law could therefore oblige controllers to seek not only advice, but also to obtain a prior authorisation from the DPA. However, this opening clause is limited to certain types of processing, i.e. processing operations carried out by the controller in the public interest. Therefore, such national laws can address some of the processing operations based on the legal basis of Article 6(1)(e) GDPR. [ 32 ] In particular, Article 36(1) GDPR mentions processing in relation to social protection and public health. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 36 GDPR \u2191 Recital 89 GDPR. \u2191 Regarding the risk based approach see Jandt , in K\u00fchling, Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 36 GDPR, margin number 1 (C.H.

The DPA would then assess whether the operation is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society (suitable to achieving a legitimate aim, the least intrusive yet equally effective mean, as well as properly balancing the risks to individuals against the interest of the controller and society).

The controller and the processor shall designate a data protection officer in any case where: 2.   A group of undertakings may appoint a single data protection officer provided that a data protection officer is easily accessible from each establishment. 3.   Where the controller or the processor is a public authority or body, a single data protection officer may be designated for several such authorities or bodies, taking account of their organisational structure and size. 4.   In cases other than those referred to in paragraph 1, the controller or processor or associations and other bodies representing categories of controllers or processors may or, where required by Union or Member State law shall, designate a data protection officer. The data protection officer may act for such associations and other bodies representing controllers or processors. 5.   The data protection officer shall be designated on the basis of professional qualities and, in particular, expert knowledge of data protection law and practices and the ability to fulfil the tasks referred to in Article 39. 6.   The data protection officer may be a staff member of the controller or processor, or fulfil the tasks on the basis of a service contract. 7.   The controller or the processor shall publish the contact details of the data protection officer and communicate them to the supervisory authority. Article 37 GDPR imposes on the controller or processor the obligation to appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) for its organisation. The DPO is a person with expert knowledge of data protection law appointed by the controller or processor in order to, inter alia, advice on data protection related issues and monitor compliance with data protection provisions. Therefore, Article 37 GDPR strongly affirms [ 1 ] the importance of the role of the DPO. [ 2 ] The role of the DPO is especially important for demonstrating compliance with data protection principles, which lies at the heart of the principle of accountability ( Articles 5(2) and 24 GDPR ). [ 3 ] Article 37 GDPR is closely connected to the rules stipulating the DPO's position ( Article 38 GDPR ) and tasks ( Article 39 GDPR ). Article 37(1) GDPR imposes on controllers and processors the obligation to appoint a DPO and lists the condition under which this obligation applies. Article 37(2) GDPR provides for the possibility of appointing a DPO for the entire group of undertakings, while Article 37(3) GDPR establishes a similar rule for public authorities. Article 37(4) GDPR extends the requirement of appointing a DPO beyond the cases specified in paragraph 1, where this is mandated by the legislation of the Union or Member States. Article 37(5) GDPR lists the required competences of the DPO, while Article 37(6) GDPR clarifies that the position of a DPO can be be held either by individuals already part of the controller's or processor's staff or external subjects on the basis of a service contract. Finally, Article 37(7) GDPR mandates the controller to publish the DPO's contact details and communicate them to the relevant data protection authority (DPA). EDPB and WP29 Guidelines : WP29, 'Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u201cDPOs\u201d)', WP 243 rev.01, 5 April 2017 (available here ); EDPS, \u2018Supervisory Guidance Role of the Data Protection Officers in EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies\u2019, 18 December 2025 (available here ). Article 37(1) GDPR outlines the cases that mandate the appointment of a DPO. This provision applies to both controllers and processors whose data processing activities entail higher risks compared to other processing operations, necessitating the appointment of a DPO as a safeguard for data subjects and to facilitate potential interventions by DPAs. The DPO plays a crucial role in ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and in proactively addressing data privacy and security concerns within organisations engaged in more sensitive or high-risk data processing activities. Article 37 GDPR concerns the designation of a DPO and applies to both controllers and processors. The obligation to appoint a DPO depends on whether the specific criteria for mandatory designation are met (see below, In any case where ). In certain cases, either the controller or the processor alone may be required to appoint a DPO, while in other situations, both the controller and its processor must appoint one and ensure their cooperation. For example: A small family business active in the distribution of household appliances in a single town uses the services of a processor whose core activity is to provide website analytics services and assistance with targeted advertising and marketing. The activities of the family business and its customers do not generate processing of data on a \u2018large scale\u2019, considering the small number of customers and the relatively limited activities. However, the activities of the processor, having many customers like this small enterprise, taken together, are carrying out large-scale processing. The processor must therefore designate a DPO under Article 37(1)(b) GDPR. At the same time, the family business itself is not under an obligation to designate a DPO. It is essential to note that even if the controller meets the criteria for mandatory DPO designation, its processor may not be obligated to appoint a DPO. Nevertheless, it is considered a best practice for the processor to appoint a DPO voluntarily. [ 4 ] The designation of a DPO is an action carried out by the controller or the processor. The GDPR does not require a specific form for the designation of a DPA; therefore, the form of the designation is flexible. Consequently, at least in theory, the absence of a written form does not render the designation invalid. However, this lack of a formal record creates evident challenges concerning accountability and the ability to demonstrate compliance as required by Article 24 GDPR . \"Unless it is obvious that an organisation is not required to designate a DPO, the WP29 recommends that controllers and processors document the internal analysis carried out to determine whether or not a DPO is to be appointed, in order to be able to demonstrate that the relevant factors have been taken into account properly.\" WP29, Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u201cDPOs\u201d)\u201d, WP 243 rev.01, 5 April 2017, p. 5. The DPO does not necessarily need to be a new, additional specialist hired by the controller or processor. Instead, an existing employee can also fulfil this role. Similarly, it is possible to appoint an external DPO (see Article 37(6) GDPR). Also, the role of a DPO does not necessarily be a full-time position but can also be a part-time role. [ 5 ] The specific resources allocated to the role of the DPO will depend on the specific situation (e.g. size, type and extend of the processing activities) of the controller or processor. [ 6 ] The GDPR does not specifically regulate the employment or service contract with an external DPO under labour or civil service law, including the establishment and termination of this relationship. Therefore, it should be pointed out that the appointment to the role of DPO should be differentiated from the employment contract; and can, inter alia, be concluded and terminated separately. [ 7 ] In particular, it should be noted that the prohibition of dismissal, as stated in Article 38(3) GDPR specifically pertains to the performance of DPO duties and does not extend to unrelated reasons beyond the scope of the DPO's responsibilities. [ 8 ] Article 37(1) GDPR specifies three conditions in which the designation of a DPO is mandatory. First, when processing is carried out by a public authority or body. Second, when the core activities of a controller or processor involve the regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large-scale. Third, when the core activities of a controller or processor involve the processing of Article 9 GDPR or Article 10 GDPR data on a large-scale. The requirement to designate a DPO in case of private organisations is therefore subject to a risk based approach; the requirement only applies in case. [ 9 ] However, the controller or processor can also designate a DPO when it is not required to do so, i.e. it is possible to voluntarily appoint a DPO. [ 10 ] According to Article 37(1)(a) GDPR, a DPO is always required when processing is carried out by a public authority or body. The GDPR does not define what constitutes a public authority or body. The WP29, endorsed by the EDPB, states that the notion is to be determined under national law. In this view, public authorities and bodies may include national, regional, and local authorities, but the term may also stretch to include other bodies that are governed by public law; In such case, the designation of a DPO is mandatory. [ 11 ] However, there are cases where a public task may also be carried out by other natural or legal persons in certain regulated sectors such as public transport services, water and energy supply, road infrastructure, public service broadcasting, public housing or disciplinary bodies for regulated professions. In these cases, data subjects may be in a very similar situation to when their data are processed by a public authority or body. In particular, \" data can be processed for similar purposes and individuals often have similarly little or no choice over whether and how their data will be processed and may thus require the additional protection that the designation of a DPO can bring .\" Here, the designation of a DPO is not mandatory but recommended. [ 12 ] Finally, Article 37(1)(a) GDPR makes clear that judicial authorities are excluded from the requirement to have a DPO, the reason for this being the principle that the judiciary is not subject to the authority of the DPA pursuant to Article 55(3) GDPR . [ 13 ] However, this derogation does not apply in instances where personal data processing is carried out by court administrations when they act as public authorities in a way that is linked to their judicial mandate. [ 14 ] Article 37(1)(b) GDPR imposes the obligation of appointing a DPO on controllers or processors whose core activities consist of processing operations which, by virtue of their nature, their scope and/or their purposes, require regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale . For the Commentary regarding these terms, see below. For example: A company provides employers with a tool allowing for the monitoring of the productivity of employees in a call centre. The company acts as a processor for the involved processing of the personal data of the employees. Such a processing activity will likely be considered to involve the regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale. The company, acting as a processor, will therefore be required to appoint a DPO. In a similar fashion to Article 37(1)(b) GDPR, Article 37(1)(c) GDPR imposes the obligation of appointing a DPO on controllers or processors whose core activities involve, on a large scale , the processing of special categories of data under Article 9 GDPR or data relating to criminal convictions and offences under Article 10 GDPR . See also Commentary below on the terms \"core activities\" and \"on a large scale\"; see Commentary on Article Article 9 GDPR and Article 10 GDPR for more information on special categories of data and data relating to criminal convictions. Article 37(1)(b) GDPR as well as Article 37(1)(c) GDPR refer to the core activity of the controller or processor regarding the requirement to appoint a DPO. In case of Article 37(1)(b) GDPR, the appointment of a DPO is required in case the controller's or processor's core activity consist of the regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale, while Article 37(1)(c) GDPR applies in case of the core activity consists of large scale processing of special categories of data related to criminal convictions and offences. In both cases, it is essential to consider whether the described processing constitute a core activity of the controller or processor. Recital 97 GDPR clarifies that the core activities of a controller are those relating to \u201c primary activities and do not relate to the processing of personal data as ancillary activities \u201d. The WP29 has clarified that the notion of core activities can be considered as \u201c the key operations necessary to achieve the controller\u2019s or processor\u2019s goals \u201d. [ 15 ] \"However, \u2018core activities\u2019 should not be interpreted as excluding activities where the processing of data forms an inextricable part of the controller\u2019s or processor\u2019s activity. For example, the core activity of a hospital is to provide health care. However, a hospital could not provide healthcare safely and effectively without processing health data, such as patients\u2019 health records. Therefore, processing these data should be considered to be one of any hospital\u2019s core activities and hospitals must therefore designate DPOs.\" WP29, Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u201cDPOs\u201d)\u201d, WP 243 rev.01, 5 April 2017, p. 7. Mere support functions (e.g. maintaining time employees' time records) do not constitute core activities of the controller or processor and do not trigger the obligation to appoint a DPO. [ 16 ] Article 37(1)(b) GDPR refers to the concept of regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects. This concept is mentioned in Recital 24 GDPR, and includes all forms of tracking and profiling on the internet, including for the purposes of behavioral advertising. [ 17 ] Monitoring of data subjects can also take place outside of the context of an online environment. Specifically, the WP29 has interpreted \u201c regular \u201d to mean: Ongoing or occurring at particular intervals for a particular period; Recurring or repeated at fixed times; or Constantly or periodically taking place. [ 18 ] \u201c Systematic \u201d, according to the WP29  should be interpreted as meaning Occurring according to a system; Pre-arranged, organized or methodical; Taking place as part of a general plan for data collection; or Carried out as part of a strategy. [ 19 ] \"Examples of activities that may constitute a regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects: operating a telecommunications network; providing telecommunications services; email retargeting; data-driven marketing activities; profiling and scoring for purposes of risk assessment (e.g. for purposes of credit scoring, establishment of insurance premiums, fraud prevention, detection of money-laundering); location tracking, for example, by mobile apps; loyalty programs; behavioural advertising; monitoring of wellness, fitness and health data via wearable devices; closed circuit television; connected devices e.g. smart meters, smart cars, home automation, etc.\" WP29, Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u201cDPOs\u201d)\u201d, WP 243 rev.01, 5 April 2017, p. 9. The term \u2018 large-scale \u2019 with regards to processing is also not defined in the GDPR. However, Recital 91 GDPR sheds some light on it, noting that large-scale processing operations might aim to \u201c process a considerable amount of personal data at regional, national, or supranational level \u201d and might \u201c affect a large number of data subjects \u201d. In this regard, the WP29 Guidelines mention four criteria with which the large-scale nature of processing operations can be assessed: the number of data subjects concerned, the volume and range of data being processed, the duration or permanence of the processing, and the geographical extent of the processing activities. [ 20 ] Examples of large-scale processing include: Examples of large-scale processing include: processing of patient data in the regular course of business by a hospital; processing of travel data of individuals using a city\u2019s public transport system (e.g. tracking via travel cards); processing of real time geo-location data of customers of an international fast food chain for statistical purposes by a processor specialised in providing these services; processing of customer data in the regular course of business by an insurance company or a bank; processing of personal data for behavioural advertising by a search engine; processing of data (content, traffic, location) by telephone or internet service providers [ 21 ] Article 37(2) GDPR allows for the designation of a single DPO for a group of undertakings (\"Group DPO\") as long as the DPO is easily accessible from each establishment. This enables the undertakings in the group to leverage synergy effects and ensure consistent handling of data protection issues. [ 22 ] The Group DPO acts as a DPO for different controllers, each of which has to inform the competent DPA about the appointment of the DPA and publish the DPO's contact details in accordance with Article 37(7) GDPR. [ 23 ] The accessibility specifically required in Article 37(2) GDPR must be read in conjunction with the other provisions relating to the tasks and position of the DPO; therefore, it must be recalled that the DPO serves as a contact point for data subjects (see Article 38(4) GDPR , DPAs (see Article 39(1)(e) GDPR ) and internally for the organisation itself (see Article 39(1)(a) GDPR ). [ 24 ] It is therefore compliant for a group of undertakings to appoint a single DPO as a Group DPO in case they are, first and foremost, reachable. The contact details of the Group DPO must therefore be available both externally and internally. [ 25 ] While it is unclear what specific requirements have to be fulfilled in order to assume the DPO's accessibility, simply disclosing the Group DPO's contact information alone cannot be considered to be sufficient. Rather, it must be possible for the controller, the data subjects and the DPA, to engage in a genuine exchange with the DPO which implies a physical proximity to the organisation as well as a short-term availability in case (e.g. in case of a personal data breach in accordance with Article 33 GDPR ). [ 26 ] To be \" accessible \" also implies that any communication should occur in the language(s) utilized by the supervisory authorities, the affected data subjects and controller or processor's staff. [ 27 ] The DPO must act as a primary point of contact. While the language proficiency of the DPO's employees can provide some support, it cannot fully replace the language competence of the DPO. This is because the DPO must have the ability to grasp the overall situation and possess at least a basic understanding of all relevant national laws, including a basic knowledge of the respective languages. [ 28 ] \"He or she, with the help of a team if necessary, must be in a position to efficiently communicate with data subjects and cooperate with the supervisory authorities concerned. This also means that this communication must take place in the language or languages used by the supervisory authorities and the data subjects concerned. The availability of a DPO (whether physically on the same premises as employees, via a hotline or other secure means of communication) is essential to ensure that data subjects will be able to contact the DPO.\" WP29, Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u201cDPOs\u201d)\u201d, WP 243 rev.01, 5 April 2017, p. 10 footnotes omitted. It should be recalled that in accordance with Article 38(2) GDPR, the DPO has to be provided with the necessary resources to carry out their tasks; for a Group DPO, this regularly means that they must be provided with a team supporting them in their role. [ 29 ] Similar to the preceding paragraph 2, Article 37(3) GDPR allows for the designation of a single DPO for several public authorities or bodies, taking into account their organisational structure and size. If a single DPO is to be appointed for a variety of tasks and across such entities, it is the task of the controller or processor (i.e. public authority or body) to ensure that the DPO can perform their activities efficiently. In other words, their acting in capacity for multiple entities must not hinder the effective execution of their tasks (see Commentary on Article 37(2) GDPR above). \"According to Article 37(3), a single DPO may be designated for several public authorities or bodies, taking account of their organisational structure and size. The same considerations with regard to resources and communication apply. Given that the DPO is in charge of a variety of tasks, the controller or the processor must ensure that a single DPO, with the help of a team if necessary, can perform these efficiently despite being designated for several public authorities and bodies.\" [WP29, Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u201cDPOs\u201d)\u201d, WP 243 rev.01, 5 April 2017, p. 6 (available here). WP29, Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u201cDPOs\u201d)\u201d, WP 243 rev.01, 5 April 2017, p. 10.] To ensure that a DPO is effective, the WP29 recommends that they be located within the European Union, regardless of whether the controller or processor themselves is also established in the Union. [ 30 ] The first part of Article 37(4) GDPR clarifies that a controller, processor, association and other bodies representing categories of controllers or processors can also appoint a DPO in case it is not obliged to do so. In other words, it is possible to voluntarily designate a DPO even if the obligation in Article 37(1) GDPR does not apply. [ 31 ] A voluntarily appointed DPO has the same rights and obligations as a required one; therefore, as an alternative to this voluntary appointed DPO some controllers appoint a person monitoring compliance with the GDPR but not formally acting as a DPO (sometimes referred to as data protection manager). [ 32 ] For instance, an association or other body representing controllers or processors could appoint a DPO in this context in order to advise the group of controllers or processors on frequently encountered issues, and could also serve as a communication channel between the represented controllers and processors, and the competent DPAs. [ 33 ] However, it is debated whether this provisions allows for such an association representing controllers or processors to appoint one DPO for those controllers or processors, acting as the (external) DPO for all those controllers or rather only as the DPO for the association; without interfering with the potential obligation of the represented controllers or processors to appoint a DPO themselves. [ 34 ] Further, Article 37(4) GDPR stipulates that Union or Member State law can provide for additional situations in which the designation of a DPO is required. [ 35 ] Article 37(5) GDPR specifies that the DPO shall be designated on the basis of their professional qualities and in particular expert knowledge of data protection law and practices and the ability to fulfil the tasks referred to in Article 39 GDPR. While Article 37(5) GDPR does not explicitly outline the specific professional qualifications for appointing the DPO, it is crucial that DPOs possess expertise in both national and European data protection laws; in particular, a comprehensive understanding of the GDPR is required, alongside with an understanding of the controller and their tasks. Furthermore, having knowledge of the business sector and the organisation's structure is valuable. The DPO should also demonstrate a throughout comprehension of the processing activities conducted, information systems, and the controller's data security and data protection requirements. In the context of a public authority or body, the DPO should also possess a sound understanding of the organisation's administrative rules and procedures. [ 36 ] For example: The DPO of a financial institution with numerous branches in different Member States should have not only a thorough understanding of data protection law but should also understand the organisation and the processes of the financial institution. Further, the DPO should have some level of understanding regarding the regulatory background of the financial industry. The required level of expertise is not strictly defined but it must be commensurate with the sensitivity, complexity and amount of data an organisation processes. Recital 97 GDPR states that the necessary level of expert knowledge that the DPO should have should be determined according to what processing operations are being carried out, and what level of protection is necessary for the data that is being processed. The more complex the processing activities are, and the more measures of protection are needed, the more \u2018knowledgeable\u2019 the DPO will have to be. \"The required level of expertise is not strictly defined but it must be commensurate with the sensitivity, complexity and amount of data an organisation processes. For example, where a data processing activity is particularly complex, or where a large amount of sensitive data is involved, the DPO may need a higher level of expertise and support. There is also a difference depending on whether the organisation systematically transfers personal data outside the European Union or whether such transfers are occasional. The DPO should thus be chosen carefully, with due regard to the data protection issues that arise within the organisation.\" WP29, Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u201cDPOs\u201d)\u201d, WP 243 rev.01, 5 April 2017, p. 11. The data protection officer shall be designated on the basis of, among the others, the ability to fulfil the tasks referred to in Article 39 GDPR . These include, but are not limited to, tasks such as informing and advising the controller and processor of their obligations under the GDPR, monitoring compliance with the GDPR and assisting in assigning responsibilities and training staff involved in processing operations, providing assistance with Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) where needed and monitoring compliance with them, and finally, cooperating with the DPA and acting as a channel of communication. The WP29 recalls that the ability to fulfil the responsibilities entrusted to the DPO should be understood to encompass both their personal qualities and knowledge, as well as their position within the organization. [ 37 ] For example, the Luxembourg DPA fined a logistics company \u20ac15,000 for failing to ensure that its DPO could exercise its tasks as outlined in Articles 39(1)(b) GDPR, inter alia because the DPO was not invited to all relevant meetings, and did not report directly to the highest level of management. [ 38 ] Personal qualities should encompass attributes such as integrity and a strong commitment to professional ethics. The character and track record of a person designated as a data protection officer play a crucial role in their suitability for the role. Past breaches of confidentiality obligations, a known history of careless work, issues with alcohol or drug use, or relevant criminal convictions such as embezzlement or bribery are significant factors that need to be considered. Personal reliability can be seen as part of the broader requirement that the DPO is capable of effectively carrying out their responsibilities. Moreover, the data protection officer's personality traits are also important, ranging from the ability to collaborate constructively to the willingness to address data protection violations with management when necessary. [ 39 ] Article 37(6) GDPR allows a designated DPO to be either a controller or processor\u2019s staff member (i.e. internal DPO), or to alternatively be appointed on the basis of a service contract (i.e. external DPO). This provision can be interpreted as providing added flexibility to the controller or processor in deciding how to best employ a DPO for their organisation. Importantly, it does not require that the DPO is an entirely impartial body who is not associated with the controller or processor, much like an independent auditor might be. However, it is essential that the DPO fulfils the applicable requirements of Section 4 Chapter IV of the GDPR \u2013 for instance, that they have no conflict of interests. In particular, see Commentary on Article 37(5) and 38 GDPR for more information on the requirements. While it is subject to some debate, [ 40 ] the WP29 seems to consider it possible to designate a legal person as DPO: \"When the function of the DPO is exercised by an external service provider, a team of individuals working for that entity may effectively carry out the DPO tasks as a team, under the responsibility of a designated lead contact and \u2018person in charge\u2019 of the client. In this case, it is essential that each member of the external organisation exercising the functions of a DPO fulfils all applicable requirements of the GDPR.\" WP29, Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u201cDPOs\u201d)\u201d, WP 243 rev.01, 5 April 2017, p. 23. Finally, Article 37(7) GDPR requires that the controller or processor (i) publishes the contact details of the DPO, and (ii) communicates them to the competent DPA. \"The objective of these requirements is to ensure that data subjects (both inside and outside of the organisation) and the supervisory authorities can easily and directly contact the DPO without having to contact another part of the organisation. Confidentiality is equally important: for example, employees may be reluctant to complain to the DPO if the confidentiality of their communications is not guaranteed.\" WP29, Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u201cDPOs\u201d)\u201d, WP 243 rev.01, 5 April 2017, p. 12. The publication of the DPO's contact details will often be part of the information provided under Article 13 and 14 GDPR, i.e. in the controllers privacy policy. See therefore commentary on Article 13(1)(b) GDPR . In general, the published contact details must make it possible to reach the DPO in an easy way (e.g. a postal address, telephone number, and/or a dedicated e-mail address). [ 41 ] Since a postal address alone does not provide for an easy way to reach the DPO, in particular when the controller interacts with data subjects in an online context (e.g. providing services online), the contact details should at least contain a designated e-mail address. [ 42 ] While, it is not necessary to publish the DPO's name, internally, the employees of an organisation should be informed not just about the contact details of the DPO but also about the DPO's identity. [ 43 ] Controllers might also provide a contact form addressed to the DPO, but since this cannot be considered as \"contact details\" in the literal sense, it should only be provided in addition to the controller's contact details. The WP29 pointed out that , \"when appropriate, for purposes of communications with the public, other means of communications could also be provided, for example, a dedicated hotline, or a dedicated contact form addressed to the DPO on the organisation's website \u201d. [ 44 ] Hence, the use of alternative forms, although not excluded by the GDPR, is not sufficient to fulfil the legal obligation if the contact details of the DPO are not provided in the first place. The contact form may, however, be provided in addition to the contact details. Regarding the communication of the DPO's contact details to the DPA, the WP29 points out that the communication of the DPO's name can be considered necessary since the DPO serves as the contact point between the organisation and the supervisory authority (see Article 39(1)(e) GDPR); the communication of a mere department mail address could therefore be considered insufficient. [ 45 ] In case a group of undertakings jointly appoint one DPO in accordance with Article 37(2) GDPR, each undertaking has to communicate the contact details to the respective competent DPA. [ 46 ] \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 37 GDPR \u2191 The notion of appointing a DPO has its roots in Article 18(2) of the Data Protection Directive 1995 (Directive 95/46/EC) (DPD). However, although the DPD spoke about the designation of a DPO, it did not make this mandatory. With the GDPR\u2019s introduction of the requirement to appoint a DPO in certain instances, the importance of the role embodied by the DPO can be said to have become pivotal. \u2191 Indeed, the importance of appointing a DPO was confirmed by the European Data Protection Supervisor when they stated that \u201c the Data Protection Officer is fundamental in insuring the respect of data protection principles within institutions/bodies \u201d.

The controller and the processor shall ensure that the data protection officer is involved, properly and in a timely manner, in all issues which relate to the protection of personal data. 2.   The controller and processor shall support the data protection officer in performing the tasks referred to in Article 39 by providing resources necessary to carry out those tasks and access to personal data and processing operations, and to maintain his or her expert knowledge. 3.   The controller and processor shall ensure that the data protection officer does not receive any instructions regarding the exercise of those tasks. He or she shall not be dismissed or penalised by the controller or the processor for performing his tasks. The data protection officer shall directly report to the highest management level of the controller or the processor. 4.   Data subjects may contact the data protection officer with regard to all issues related to processing of their personal data and to the exercise of their rights under this Regulation. 5.   The data protection officer shall be bound by secrecy or confidentiality concerning the performance of his or her tasks, in accordance with Union or Member State law. 6.   The data protection officer may fulfil other tasks and duties. The controller or processor shall ensure that any such tasks and duties do not result in a conflict of interests. Article 38 GDPR sets out the position of the data protection officer (DPO) within an organisation. This provision is therefore closely connected to the other provisions governing the role of the DPO, i.e., Article 37 GDPR (designation of the data protection officer) and Article 39 GDPR (tasks of the data protection officer). In particular, Article 38 GDPR outlines that the position of the DPO has to be structured in an organisation in order to be able to fulfil its role. The requirements set out in this provision apply to mandatory DPOs ( Article 37(1) GDPR ) as well as to DPOs appointed voluntarily by a controller or processor ( Article 37(4) GDPR ). [ 1 ] Article 38(1) GDPR provides for the controller's and processor's obligation to ensure the DPO's timely and proper involvement in any data protection issues. Article 38(2) GDPR states that controllers and processors are required to support the DPO in the execution of their tasks by providing necessary resources. Article 38(3) GDPR highlights the independent nature of the DPO's role, ensuring they are free from any influence or retaliation from the controller in matters pertaining to their office. Article 38(4) GDPR ensures that data subjects have the right to contact the DPO regarding any issues concerning the processing of their personal data and the exercise of their data protection rights. Finally, Article 38(5) and (6) GDPR impose an obligation of confidentiality on the DPO and address rules concerning potential conflicts of interest. EDPB, EDPS and WP29 Guidelines : WP29, 'Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u201cDPOs\u201d)', WP 243 rev.01, 5 April 2017 (available here ), and EDPS, \u2018Supervisory Guidance - Role of the Data Protection Officers in EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies\u2019, 18 December 2025 (available here ). Article 38(1) GDPR obliges the controller and the processor to ensure that the DPO is involved, properly and in a timely manner, in all issues which relate to the protection of personal data. The addressee of this is provision is the controller or processor who appoints a DPO. It is irrelevant whether the controller or processor was obliged required to appoint a DPO or they were appointed voluntarily. [ 2 ] However, the controller or processor's obligation to involve the DPO in all data protection issues corresponds with an internal right of the DPO to demand such involvement. [ 3 ] Core of this provisions is the required involvement of the DPO whenever an issue relates to the protection of personal data. However, this does not mean that the DPO has to be involved in every processing step (i.e. every time the controller processes personal data), rather this should be considered as the DPO's involvement in the processing activities on a procedural level. [ 4 ] For example, this could be the design and development of a product, as well as the creation of a new service or modification of an existing one by adding new features. [ 5 ] While the appropriate involvement of the DPO in any processing operation can vary based on the respective complexity and risk, this should not be used as an excuse to avoid involving the DPO at all. [ 6 ] In any case the DPO has to be involved proactively by the controller or processor; it is not sufficient that the DPO has the option to request the necessary information. [ 7 ] DPOs should also be regularly involved in management meetings, and opinions of the DPO should be given due weight. In case management disagrees with the DPO\u2019s opinions, the Article 29 Working Party (WP29) recommends documenting the reasons for not following the DPO\u2019s position. [ 8 ] Indeed, this best practice seems also necessary to comply with the principle of accountability (Articles 5(2) and 24 GDPR). Regarding the question, what should be considered an adequate involvement of the DPO, reference can be made to the DPO's tasks set out in Article 39 GDPR . [ 9 ] This means that the involvement of the DPO must enable them to fulfill their tasks; e.g. the DPO must be in a position to inform and advice the controller or processor on data protection issues and to monitor compliance with data protection regulation. [ 10 ] In particular, the DPO's task to monitor the controller's or processor's compliance with data protection regulation requires that the DPO is made aware of all processing operations and is able to request all necessary information from the involved departments and employees. [ 11 ] However, it should be pointed out that the DPO does not make any management decisions regarding the controller's or processor's processing operations (in particular, regarding the purposes and means of the processing) and the controller or processor remains responsible for the compliance with data protection regulation. [ 12 ] Therefore, despite their involvement in management decisions, the DPO cannot be held personally liable for the non-compliance of the organisation, as liability always stays with the controller. [ 13 ] According to Article 38(1) GDPR, the DPO must be involved in a timely manner in all issues which relate to the protection of personal data. In this context, \" in timely manner \" means the earliest possible stage, ideally the design stage of processing operations. In any case, the DPO shall be involved at a stage when fundamental decisions can still be taken. [ 14 ] The early involvement of the DPO is also an important factor in complying with the privacy by design principle set out in Article 25 GDPR . [ 15 ] In any case, the DPO should be provided with sufficient time to appropriately asses any processing operation; it should not be expected from the DPO to provide any ad-hoc assessments. [ 16 ] Neither would it be compliant to only present the DPO with already final decisions without giving him the option to influence the outcome. [ 17 ] Among others, the early involvement is necessary in order to adequately conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). [ 18 ] \"It is crucial that the DPO, or his/her team, is involved from the earliest stage possible in all issues relating to data protection. In relation to data protection impact assessments, the GDPR explicitly provides for the early involvement of the DPO and specifies that the controller shall seek the advice of the DPO when carrying out such impact assessments. Ensuring that the DPO is informed and consulted at the outset will facilitate compliance with the GDPR, promote a privacy by design approach and should therefore be standard procedure within the organisation\u2019s governance. In addition, it is important that the DPO be seen as a discussion partner within the organisation and that he or she be part of the relevant working groups dealing with data processing activities within the organisation.\" WP29, Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u201cDPOs\u201d)\u201d, WP 243 rev.01, 5 April 2017, p. 13 (footnotes omitted). Article 38(2) GDPR obliges the controller or processor to support the DPO in performing their tasks (see Article 39 GDPR ) by (i) providing resources necessary to carry out those tasks and (ii) access to personal data and processing operations, and (iii) to maintain their expert knowledge. Just as Article 38(1) GDPR, this provision is addressed to the controller or processor who designated a DPO. See above for more information. Under Article 38(2) GDPR, the DPO must be provided with all necessary resources to carry out their tasks, including access to personal data and processing operations and the possibility to maintain the expert knowledge which is necessary to perform their tasks. Regarding the necessary resources the DPO should be provided with, the WP29 suggests considering certain elements: The active support of the DPO by senior management. Sufficient time for the DPO to fulfil their responsibilities set out in Article 39 GDPR ; in particular in case a DPO is employed only on a part-time basis and/or also has different duties in the organisation, as conflicting priorities could hinder their effectiveness. To address this, the person filling the DPO's role should dedicate an appropriate and sufficient amount of their time to this role. Adequate financial resources, infrastructure such as premises, facilities and equipment, and supportive staff where appropriate. Communication of the designation of the DPO to the organisation's staff in order to ensure that their existence and function are known within the organisation. Access to other services, such as Human Resources, legal, IT, security, etc., allowing the DPOs to receive support, input and information from those other services as well. Access to technical, and personnel resources. It is also essential to communicate the existence and contact details of the DPO to all staff members of the controller or processor to ensure accessibility. [ 19 ] \"In general, the more complex and/or sensitive the processing operations, the more resources must be given to the DPO. The data protection function must be effective and sufficiently well-resourced in relation to the data processing being carried out.\" WP29, Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u201cDPOs\u201d)\u201d, WP 243 rev.01, 5 April 2017, p. 14. In particular, the DPO must be provided with the basic information about the IT infrastructure of the controller or processor as well as with information about the processing operations which should not be limited to the information in the record of processing activities under Article 30 GDPR. [ 20 ] While all this is true for internal as well as for external DPOs, [ 21 ] external DPOs will generally allocate the necessary resources of time, personal and facilities themselves while the controller or processor only provides the required financial resources. However, the external DPO still needs all required access to and information about the processing operation as well as it needs to be involved in data protection issues in accordance with Article 38(1) GDPR. [ 22 ] The authority to access personal data and processing operations mentioned in the GDPR entails for example that the DPO must be allowed to enter all premises where personal data is or may be processed, including on the premises of data processors. [ 23 ] The DPO should similarly be provided with the necessary access rights in the controller's or processor's IT-system to fulfil its tasks. [ 24 ] It should be recalled that in accordance with Article 37(5) GDPR, the DPO should already have expert knowledge of data protection law when being appointed to this role. During the time of the appointment, the DPO should be provided with continuous training, allowing them to to stay up to date with regard to developments within the field of data protection. [ 25 ] Expert knowledge can be maintained through the institution of updating courses to keep the DPO and their team informed about data protection developments and related disciplines. Alternatively, the DPO must be put in the condition to autonomously catch up with the relevant updates, being the workload no justification to postpone or ignore such an obligation. According to Article 38(3) GDPR, the DPO\u2019s independence in the organisation must be guaranteed by the controller or processor. In particular, the DPO may not receive any instructions from either of them regarding their tasks, and may not be dismissed or sanctioned for performing these tasks. This extends to the personnel working under the DPO, which should only receive substantive directions from the DPO and not from the controller or processor. [ 26 ] Just as Article 38(1) and (2) GDPR, this provision is addressed to the controller or processor who designated a DPO. See above for more information regarding the addressee. The first part of Article 38(3) GDPR stipulates that the DPO must not receive any instructions from the controller or processor regarding the exercise of their tasks as DPO; in other words, it grants the DPO the right to carry out their duties with an adequate level of autonomy and independence . In essence, the DPO is empowered to perform their responsibilities without being subject to direct instructions or interference from the controller or processor. As DPOs fulfil their responsibilities under Article 39 GDPR , they must not receive any instructions on how to handle a matter, such as specifying the desired outcome, guiding the investigation of a complaint, or determining whether to consult the supervisory authority. Additionally, they should not be directed to adopt a particular perspective on issues related to data protection law, including a specific interpretation of the law. This provision ensures the DPO's independence and prevents any undue influence that could compromise their objective and impartial role in safeguarding data protection rights. [ 27 ] \"This means that, in fulfilling their tasks under Article 39, DPOs must not be instructed how to deal with a matter, for example, what result should be achieved, how to investigate a complaint or whether to consult the supervisory authority. Furthermore, they must not be instructed to take a certain view of an issue related to data protection law, for example, a particular interpretation of the law. The autonomy of DPOs does not, however, mean that they have decision-making powers extending beyond their tasks pursuant to Article 39. The controller or processor remains responsible for compliance with data protection law and must be able to demonstrate compliance.\" WP29, Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u201cDPOs\u201d)\u201d, WP 243 rev.01, 5 April 2017, p. 15. \"[T]he objective of ensuring the functional independence of the DPO, as it follows from the second sentence of Article 38(3) of the GDPR, is also apparent from the first and third sentences of that provision, which require that that DPO is not to receive any instructions regarding the exercise of those tasks and is to report directly to the highest level of management of the controller or processor, and from Article 38(5), which provides that, with regard to that exercise, that DPO is to be bound by secrecy or confidentiality [...]\" CJEU - C-453/21 - X-Fab Dresden GmbH & Co. KG , margin number 26 with further reference. Article 38(3) requires that DPOs should \" not be dismissed or penalised by the controller or the processor for performing [their] tasks .\" This measure strengthens the autonomy of the DPO by shielding them from possible retaliations by the employer, controller, or processor. In particular, it should enable the DPO to ask uncomfortable questions and provide unfavourable assessments concerning processing operations of the controller or processor. [ 28 ] Thus, the DPO's functional independence should be further strengthened by this provision. [ 29 ] While the terms \u2018dismissed\u2019, \u2018penalised\u2019 and \u2018for performing [their] tasks\u2019 are not defined in the GDPR, it means that that DPO must be protected against any decision terminating his or her duties, by which they would be placed at a disadvantage or which would constitute a penalty. [ 30 ] It should be noted that this provision only prohibits the dismissal of the DPO or penalties in case they are connected to the exercise of the DPO's functions. \"Penalties are only prohibited under the GDPR if they are imposed as a result of the DPO carrying out his or her duties as a DPO. For example, a DPO may consider that a particular processing is likely to result in a high risk and advise the controller or the processor to carry out a data protection impact assessment but the controller or the processor does not agree with the DPO\u2019s assessment. In such a situation, the DPO cannot be dismissed for providing this advice.\" WP29, Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u201cDPOs\u201d)\u201d, WP 243 rev.01, 5 April 2017, p. 15. However, just like any other employee or contractor under applicable national contract, labour, and criminal law, a DPO could still be legitimately dismissed for reasons unrelated to the performance of their DPO tasks. For example, grounds for dismissal might include theft, physical, psychological, or sexual harassment, or other forms of gross misconduct. [ 31 ] The burden of proof to show that that the reasons for a penalty or dismissal do not lie in the performance of the DPO's task lies with the controller or processor. [ 32 ] In particular, the fact that the DPO must not be dismissed for performing their task does not mean that they cannot be dismissed at all. While the GDPR does not specify specify how and when a DPO can be dismissed or replaced by another person, the contract with the DPO (i.e. the appointment) can be limited in time but should last long enough to enable the DPO to work effectively rather than only cover an onboarding period. [ 33 ] Also, it should be pointed out that the DPO can be dismissed in case they no longer fulfil the requirements of a DPO or in case they fail to fulfil their tasks as a DPO. [ 34 ] Penalties (i.e. sanctions) against the DPO can take various forms, both direct and indirect. These may include the absence or delay of promotions, hindrance in career advancement, or denial of benefits that other employees receive. Regarding penalties or sanctions related to the exercise of the DPO\u2019s functions, a broad interpretation must be followed. For example, the DPO shall not suffer disadvantages in the form of threats, absence or delay of promotion, or denial from benefits which other employees receive. In other words, it is not necessary for these penalties to be actually implemented; even a mere threat is sufficient as long as they are used to penalize the DPO based on their DPO activities. [ 35 ] It should be noted that this protection of the DPO is applicable for internal as well as for external DPOs. [ 36 ] \"[T]he second sentence of Article 38(3) of the GDPR applies without distinction both to the DPO who is a member of the staff of the controller or processor and to the person who fulfils the tasks on the basis of a service contract concluded with the latter, in accordance with Article 37(6) of the GDPR, with the result that the second sentence of Article 38(3) is intended to apply to relationships between a DPO and a controller or processor, irrespective of the nature of the relationship between that DPO and the latter [...]\" CJEU - C-453/21 - X-Fab Dresden GmbH & Co. KG , margin number 23 with further references. While each Member State generally is free to lay down more protective specific provisions regarding the dismissal of the DPO, such a provision must not undermine the GDPR; e.g. by preventing the dismissal of a DPO who no longer possesses the professional qualities required to perform their task in Accordance with Article 37(5) GDPR, or who does not fulfil those tasks in accordance with the provisions of that regulation. [ 37 ] \"[I]ncreased protection for the DPO which would prevent the dismissal of the DPO in the event that he or she is not, or is no longer, in a position to carry out his or her tasks in an independent manner on account of there being a conflict of interests would undermine the achievement of that objective.\" CJEU - C-453/21 - X-Fab Dresden GmbH & Co. KG , margin number 34. If the controller or processor takes decisions that are not in line with the GDPR and contradict the advice given by the DPO, the DPO should have the opportunity to express their dissenting opinion to the highest management level and decision-makers. Article 38(3) GDPR facilitates this process by stating that the DPO \" shall directly report to the highest management level of the controller or the processor .\" This direct reporting ensures that senior management, such as the board of directors, is informed of the DPO's advice and recommendations, as it is part of the DPO's role to inform and advise the controller or processor. Another example of direct reporting is the preparation of an annual report detailing the DPO's activities, which is submitted to the highest management level. [ 38 ] For example: A controller's DPO is integrated in the controller's legal department and only reports internally to the department head which in turn report to the highest management level. Such a structure would be incompatible with the requirements of Article 28(3) GDPR. Not just because the DPO must be able to directly report to the highest management level, but also such a structure would likely lack the necessary independence of the DPO. [ 39 ] Article 38(4) GDPR grants data subjects the right to contact the DPO on any issues related to (i) the processing of their personal data and (ii) the exercise of their rights under the GDPR. Obviously, this is limited to issues relating to the processing operations of the controller or processor. [ 40 ] It should be recalled that under Article 13(1)(b) and 14(1)(b) GDPR , the controller is obliged to inform data subjects about the contact details of the data protection officer; and under Article 37(7) GDPR the controller or processor has to publish the DPO's contact details. [ 41 ] Regarding the first aspect (i.e. the option to contact the DPO on issues relating to the processing of their personal data), the possibility of contacting the DPO implies their capability to conduct internal investigations to verify the existence of violations, if necessary, and report such findings to top management. Furthermore, the DPO should inform the data subject about the results of their investigation. [ 42 ] Concerning the exercise of data subject rights, it is worth noting that the DPO is not directly responsible for executing these rights. Instead, their role is to inform the data subject about the specific rights they possess, particularly in relation to the data subject's specific case. Nonetheless, the obligation to ensure the proper exercise of each right ultimately remains the responsibility of the controller. [ 43 ] The DPO must be directly reachable by the data subject. If the communication is directed to another recipient, it should be forwarded \"unopened\" to the DPO or a member of their team. This reinforces the notion that the contact details provided in accordance with Article 37(7) GDPR should enable direct communication with the DPO, possibly even through encrypted means. [ 44 ] Article 38(5) GDPR stipulates that the DPO is bound by secrecy or confidentiality concerning the performance of their tasks, in accordance with Union or Member State law. The phrasing of this provision is not entirely precise. Firstly, the distinction between \" secrecy \" and \" confidentiality \" is not entirely clear, as both terms involve containing information within a special relationship, withholding it from others. [ 45 ] More importantly, the provision does not clarify the exact scope of the confidentiality obligation and whether it is simply a referral to any European or national law that regulates such secrecy or confidentiality or whether it is supposed to set out a separate confidentiality obligation applicable even in the absence of such a provision in European or Member State law. [ 46 ] However, this provision should be understood as establishing a (separate) confidentiality obligation of the DPO. [ 47 ] The reference to European and Member State law can be considered as the option to further regulate and limit the confidentiality requirements (in particular, at the national level), as well as the legal consequences of breaching these requirements. [ 48 ] For instance, in the case of Article 39(1)(b) GDPR (monitoring the controller's compliance with the rules), confidentiality should protect the data subject, who is the passive subject of potential violations committed by the controller. Thus, the DPO shall be bound by secrecy or confidentiality regarding all elements of the request, including the data subject's identity. [ 49 ] Similarly, this provision is supposed to protect any confidential information of the controller such as business secrets and is a requirement for the DPO's capability to access all relevant information in connection with the controller's or processor's processing operations. [ 50 ] [T]he obligation of secrecy/confidentiality does not prohibit the DPO from contacting and seeking advice from the supervisory authority. Article 39(1)(e) provides that the DPO can consult the supervisory authority on any other matter, where appropriate. WP29, Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u201cDPOs\u201d)\u201d, WP 243 rev.01, 5 April 2017, p. 18. Tightly connected to the independence requirement is Article 38(6) GDPR which emphasises that while the DPO may fulfil other tasks and duties, these should not result in a conflict of interests. Therefore, the DPO must not be in positions which result in determining the purposes and means of the processing operations of the organisation which appointed the DPO. [ 51 ] \"As a rule of thumb, conflicting positions within the organisation may include senior management positions (such as chief executive, chief operating, chief financial, chief medical officer, head of marketing department, head of Human Resources or head of IT departments) but also other roles lower down in the organisational structure if such positions or roles lead to the determination of purposes and means of processing. In addition, a conflict of interests may also arise for example if an external DPO is asked to represent the controller or processor before the Courts in cases involving data protection issues.\" WP29, Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u201cDPOs\u201d)\u201d, WP 243 rev.01, 5 April 2017, p. 16. Similarly, a possible indicator of a conflict of interest is could be an (unusually high) economic interest in the economic success of the organisation they are working for (e.g. a co-owner of a partnership but not a negligible shareholder in a publicly traded company). [ 52 ] The same is generally true for family members of the organisation's owner. [ 53 ] \"[T]he GDPR does not establish that there is a fundamental incompatibility between, on the one hand, the performance of DPO\u2019s duties and, on the other hand, the performance of other duties within the controller or processor. Article 38(6) of that regulation specifically provides that the DPO may be entrusted with performing tasks and duties other than those for which it is responsible under Article 39 of the GDPR. [...] the controller or its processor must ensure that those other tasks and duties do not give rise to a \u2018conflict of interests\u2019. In the light of the meaning of those words in everyday language, it must be held that, in accordance with the objective pursued by Article 38(6) of the GDPR, the DPO cannot be entrusted with performing tasks or duties which could impair the execution of the functions performed by the DPO. [...] that provision is, in essence, intended [...] to preserve the functional independence of the DPO and, consequently, to ensure the effectiveness of the provisions of the GDPR. [...] according to Article 39(1)(b) of the GDPR, the task of the DPO is, inter alia, to monitor compliance with the GDPR, other provisions of EU law or of the law of the Member States on data protection and the policies of the controller or processor in relation to the protection of personal data, including the assignment of responsibilities, awareness-raising and training of staff involved in processing operations, and the related audits. It follows, in particular, that a DPO cannot be entrusted with tasks or duties which would result in him or her determining the objectives and methods of processing personal data on the part of the controller or its processor. Under EU law or the law of the Member States on data protection, the review of those objectives and methods must be carried out independently by the DPO. The determination of the existence of a conflict of interests, within the meaning of Article 38(6) of the GDPR, must be carried out, case by case, on the basis of an assessment of all the relevant circumstances, in particular the organisational structure of the controller or its processor and in the light of all the applicable rules, including any policies of the controller or its processor.\" CJEU - C-453/21 - X-Fab Dresden GmbH & Co.

The data protection officer shall have at least the following tasks: 2.   The data protection officer shall in the performance of his or her tasks have due regard to the risk associated with processing operations, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing. Article 39 GDPR, is titled \" Tasks of the data protection officer \" and accordingly outlines the primary responsibilities of the Data Protection Officer (DPO). This provision should therefore be read in conjunction with the other provisions provisions governing the role of the DPO; i.e. Article 37 GDPR (designation of the DPO) and Article 38 GDPR (position of the DPO). Article 39(1) GDPR provides for a list of the DPO's tasks which should be considered the minimum of tasks the DPO should be assigned. [ 1 ] Specifically, this list encompasses the task: to inform the controller, processor, and their staff about the obligations arising from the GDPR and other applicable data protection laws (Article 39(1)(a) GDPR); to monitor compliance with the GDPR within their organization, which includes ensuring adherence to relevant internal policies, staff training, and conducting audits as necessary (Article 39(1)(b) GDPR); to provide advice as regards the preparation of a Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) in accordance with Article 35 GDPR (Article 39(1)(c) GDPR). to cooperate with the Data Protection Authority (DPA) (Article 39(1)(d) GDPR); to act as the contact point for the supervisory authority on any matters or issues related to data protection, including the requirement for prior consultation as specified in Article 36 GDPR (Article 39(1)(e) GDPR). Finally, Article 39(2) GDPR emphasizes that, in fulfilling their duties, the DPO must take into account the risks associated with data processing operations, considering the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing. EDPB, EDPS and WP29 Guidelines : WP29, 'Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u201cDPOs\u201d)', WP 243 rev.01, 5 April 2017 (available here ), and EDPS, \u2018Supervisory Guidance - Role of the Data Protection Officers in EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies\u2019, 18 December 2025 (available here ). Article 39(1) GDPR provides a list of tasks that the DPO must perform according to the GDPR. These tasks cannot be restricted by national regulations. As highlighted by the phrase \" at least \", additional functions or duties may be assigned to the DPO, such as conducting training for the controller's employees. [ 2 ] To include such additional functions, they must be explicitly specified in the appointment document or in relevant updates. In accordance with Article 38(2) GDPR , the DPO must receive all necessary resources to fulfil their (original as well as supplementary) tasks effectively. This ensures that the DPO is adequately equipped and supported to carry out their responsibilities in a comprehensive and efficient manner. [ 3 ] Further, any additional tasks assigned to the controller must not diminish the DPO's independence. Therefore, it will generally not be possible to assign the DPO with any tasks of the senior management in addition to their role as DPO. [ 4 ] In accordance with Article 39(2) GDPR, the DPO should follow a risk based approach when fulfilling this task. [ 5 ] In any case, the DPO has to be assigned the following tasks: In accordance with Article 39(1)(a) GDPR, the DPO has to inform and advise the controller, processor, and employees about their respective obligations under the GDPR and other applicable data protection laws. It should be recalled that such information and advice has to be provided, in particular, to the highest management level of the controller or the processor. [ 6 ] The scope of the obligation to inform and advise covers the GDPR as well as other Union or Member State data protection provisions. In particular, all of Chapter IV of the GDPR, which covers the general obligations of the controller and processor, is particularly relevant in this regard. Notable elements include technical and organizational measures required to demonstrate compliance ( Article 24 GDPR ), the selection of technical capabilities and default settings to ensure compliance with rights and the GDPR from the outset of data processing ( Article 25 GDPR), obligations related to joint controllers and processors ( Articles 26 and 28 GDPR , respectively), maintaining records of processing activities ( Article 30 GDPR ), ensuring the security of processing ( Article 32 GDPR ), responsibilities of the DPO in case of data breaches ( Articles 33 and 34 GDPR), and preparation of data protection impact assessments and prior consultation ( Articles 35 and 36 GDPR). Similarly, the controller's or processor's obligations connected to the data subjects rights (Chapter III of the GDPR) and the principles set out in Article 5 GDPR are of massive importance for the DPO's advisory role. However, this does in no way exclude any other provisions of the GDPR or from other applicable laws, both at the European level (e.g., the e-Privacy Directive) or national level. The obligation to inform covers any legal matters or developments concerning data protection, such as new legislative requirements, innovative judicial interpretations, as well as technical developments that could change previous risk assessments. This obligation is proactive , meaning that it is up to the DPO to inform the recipient (controller or processor) about such elements. On the other hand, the obligation to advise relates to specific  issues arising during data processing operations. In such cases, the DPO clarifies the obligations that arise in a specific situation and provides solutions in line with applicable laws. In practice, the data protection officer's responsibility for informing and advising can be carried out through various approaches. [ 7 ] At this point it should be recalled that the DPO has to be provided with the necessary resources to fulfil this task (see Article 38(2) GDPR ); in particular, the DPO needs to be provided with the means to maintain an expert knowledge of data protection law. [ 8 ] A practical example could be the issuing a report to the management, authority, or key personnel within the company or organization, highlighting the latest developments in data protection laws. This report may also offer the assurance that the DPO is available to provide further elaboration and explanation on the raised issues if needed. [ 9 ] Article 39(1)(b) GDPR assigns DPOs the responsibility to monitor compliance with the GDPR, as further specified in Recital 97, which states that the DPO should assist the controller or processor in monitoring internal compliance with the GDPR. As part of their duty to monitor compliance, DPOs may engage in various activities, such as collecting information to identify processing operations, analysing and verifying the compliance of such operations, and providing information, advice, and recommendations to the controller or processor. [ 10 ] For example: In course of a continues improvement process, a DPO could, inter alia, perform a yearly audit of different departments, verifying whether the record of processing activity is still complete and corresponds with the processing operations employed in practice as well as whether compliance with the processing principles is ensured and processes for complying with data subject rights are in place. However, it should be noted that data protection compliance is ultimately a corporate responsibility of the controller and not that of the DPO. [ 11 ] \"Monitoring of compliance does not mean that it is the DPO who is personally responsible where there is an instance of non-compliance. The GDPR makes it clear that it is the controller, not the DPO, who is required to \u2018implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with this Regulation\u2019 (Article 24(1)). Data protection compliance is a corporate responsibility of the data controller, not of the DPO.\" WP29, Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u201cDPOs\u201d)\u201d, WP 243 rev.01, 5 April 2017, p. 17. As per Article 35(1) GDPR , conducting a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) is the responsibility of the controller, not the DPO. [ 12 ] Nonetheless, the DPO can still play a valuable role in assisting the controller. In line with the principle of data protection by design, Article 35(2) GDPR explicitly states that the controller must seek advice from the DPO when undertaking a DPIA. [ 13 ] Similarly, this Article 39(1)(c) GDPR assigns to the DPO the task of providing advice, upon request, concerning the DPIA and monitoring its execution as outlined in Article 35 GDPR . [ 14 ] It should be recalled that in accordance with Article 35(2) GDPR , the controller is obliged to seek the DPO's advice; therefore, irrespective of the usage of the wording \"upon request\" in Article 39(1)(c) GDPR the DPO (if one is appointed) must always be consulted when a DPIA is conducted. [ 15 ] It is doubtful, whether a DPO can be tasked - in addition to their consultation and monitoring - to conduct the DPIA by themselves, since this would mean that the DPO monitors their own performance. [ 16 ] While this provision does not go into more detail regarding the scope of the DPO's advice, the WP29 recommends that the controller seeks the advice of the DPO on the following issues in connection to the performance of a DPIA: whether or not to conduct a DPIA, the appropriate methodology for the performance of the DPIA, whether to perform the DPIA internally or outsource it, what safeguards to apply to address risks to data subjects' rights and interests, and whether the DPIA has been correctly carried out and its conclusions comply with the GDPR. [ 17 ] \"If the controller disagrees with the advice provided by the DPO, the DPIA documentation should specifically justify in writing why the advice has not been taken into account.\" WP29, Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u201cDPOs\u201d)\u201d, WP 243 rev.01, 5 April 2017, p. 18 footnotes omitted. Moreover, to the data protection officer is also assigned the responsibility to actively monitor the implementation of a DPIA, rather than solely upon request. The DPO is required to assess compliance with the requirements outlined in Article 35 GDPR and review the content of the assessments conducted. In doing so, the DPO must have access to the relevant documentation. Subsequently, the DPO should provide a report on the evaluation of the process, pointing out any significant deficiencies. [ 18 ] It should be recalled that the DPO must have the option to report directly to the highest management level. [ 19 ] Although the controller or processor is not obliged to follow the DPO\u2019s opinion or objections, it should document its reasons if it chooses not to do so. [ 20 ] Common mistake: Some controller consider it the obligation of the DPO to assess, on its own, whether a processing operation requires the performance of a prior DPIA as well as the performance of the DPIA itself. However, this is not the case. The DPO has a advising role in the performance of the DPIA and is not responsible for it. Articles 39(1)(d) and (e) GDPR lay down the DPO\u2019s obligations in relation to the DPAs. On the one hand, the DPO has to cooperate with the DPA (Article 39(1(e) GDPR); on the other hand, the DPO has to act as the contact point for the supervisory authority on issues relating to processing, including the prior consultation referred to in Article 36 GDPR , and to consult, where appropriate, with regard to any other matter. \"These tasks refer to the role of \u2018facilitator\u2019 of the DPO [...]. The DPO acts as a contact point to facilitate access by the supervisory authority to the documents and information for the performance of the tasks mentioned in Article 57, as well as for the exercise of its investigative, corrective, authorisation, and advisory powers mentioned in Article 58. As already mentioned, the DPO is bound by secrecy or confidentiality concerning the performance of his or her tasks, in accordance with Union or Member State law (Article 38(5)). However, the obligation of secrecy/confidentiality does not prohibit the DPO from contacting and seeking advice from the supervisory authority. Article 39(1)(e) provides that the DPO can consult the supervisory authority on any other matter, where appropriate.\" WP29, Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u201cDPOs\u201d)\u201d, WP 243 rev.01, 5 April 2017, p. 18. For example, the DPO could facilitate cooperation in prior consultation procedures or DPA investigations. [ 21 ] Due to this contact point function of the DPO, the controller should involve the DPO in any contact with the DPA. [ 22 ] However, while a DPA can always contact the DPO, contacting other members of\u00a0an organisation is also possible. [ 23 ] The controller or processor not limit the DPO's option to contact the DPA, e.g. by  requiring the DPO to always seek internal approval before contacting the DPA. [ 24 ] It should also be pointed out that generally, the DPO is not obliged to report any GDPR violations to the DPA. [ 25 ] Rather, in case the DPO considers a processing operation to violate the GDPR, they should initially bring this to the controller's or processor's attention and support them in bringing the processing in compliance. However, in particular if the controller or processor does not act after the DPO brings their concerns to the controller's or processor's attention, the DPO can inform the DPA accordingly. In case of particularly severe violations, the DPO might also directly approach the DPA without prior internal consultation. [ 26 ] According to Article 39(2) GDPR, the DPO must \u201c have due regard to the risk associated with the processing operations, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing. \u201d While this provision is meant to help DPOs in prioritising certain tasks or in choosing the most adequate DPIA methodology, it does not mean that low-risk areas may be completely neglected; a risk-based approach should never mean that processing activities which do not pose a high risk are exempt from any of the GDPR\u2019s protections. [ 27 ] \"[Article 39(2) GDPR] recalls a general and common sense principle, which may be relevant for many aspects of a DPO\u2019s day-to-day work. In essence, it requires DPOs to prioritise their activities and focus their efforts on issues that present higher data protection risks. This does not mean that they should neglect monitoring compliance of data processing operations that have comparatively lower level of risks, but it does indicate that they should focus, primarily, on the higher-risk areas. This selective and pragmatic approach should help DPOs advise the controller what methodology to use when carrying out a DPIA, which areas should be subject to an internal or external data protection audit, which internal training activities to provide to staff or management responsible for data processing activities, and which processing operations to devote more of his or her time and resources to.\" WP29, Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u201cDPOs\u201d)\u201d, WP 243 rev.01, 5 April 2017, p. 18. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 39 GDPR \u2191 Bergt, Herbort , in K\u00fchling, Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 39 GDPR, margin number 1 (C.H.

This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the Union, regardless of whether the processing takes place in the Union or not. 2. This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established in the Union, where the processing activities are related to: 3. This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data by a controller not established in the Union, but in a place where Member State law applies by virtue of public international law. The first two paragraphs of Article 3 GDPR define the territorial scope of the Regulation on the basis of two main criteria: the establishment of a controller or a processor in the Union; or being active on the EU market by offering services or goods or monitoring behavior. Where one of these two criteria is met, the relevant provisions of the GDPR will apply to the processing of personal data. The third paragraph confirms the application of the GDPR to processing activities to which \u201c Member State law applies by virtue of public international law \u201d, [ 1 ] such as an embassy of an EU Member State in a third country. EDPB Guidelines: for this Article, please see Guidelines 05/2021 on the Interplay between the application of Article 3 and the provisions on international transfers as per Chapter V of the GDPR ; and EDPB Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3) - version adopted after public consultation . The GDPR does not provide a definition of 'establishment' for the purpose of Article 3. The application of this provision depends on two rather broad concepts: the 'controller ' , which may include natural or legal persons, public authorities, agencies or other bodies (see details under Article 4(7) GDPR ); and one or more 'establishments' of said controller in the Union. Common mistake: It is important to note that the GDPR, like other EU law, merely uses the term 'Union', even if the GDPR applies to the entire European Economic Area (EEA), which includes not only the 27 EU Member States, but also Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein. EU law, including the GDPR, may also apply to overseas territories of Member States. The details differ per territory. An 'establishment' does not need to be a separate legal entity in the European Union. It may also be just an office or other form of activity in the Union. Recital 22 states that the \u201c [e]stablishment implies the effective and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements. The legal form of such arrangements, whether through a branch or a subsidiary with a legal personality, is not the determining factor in that respect \u201d. [ 2 ] According to the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), \" [t]his wording is identical to that found in Recital 19 of Directive 95/46/EC, to which reference has been made in several CJEU rulings broadening the interpretation of the term 'establishment', departing from a formalistic approach whereby undertakings are established solely in the place where they are registered \". [ 3 ] In particular, in C\u2011230/14 - Weltimmo the CJEU extended the definition of establishment \u201c to any real and effective activity - even a minimal one - exercised through stable arrangements \u201d. [ 4 ] For example: A subsidiary of a US car manufacturer in Belgium supervises its European activities, including marketing and advertising. The Belgian subsidiary operates through a 'stable arrangement' since it carries out activities which are genuine and instrumental to the main economic activity of the US headquarters. As such, it can be seen as an 'establishment' under the GDPR. [ 5 ] The EDPB pointed out that the threshold for 'stable arrangement' is quite low. Indeed, it could be met by the simple presence of a single employee or agent of a non-EU entity in the Union - if that employee or agent acts with a sufficient degree of stability. \"The threshold for \u201cstable arrangement\u201d can actually be quite low when the centre of activities of a controller concerns the provision of services online. As a result, in some circumstances, the presence of one single employee or agent of a non-EU entity in the Union may be sufficient to constitute a stable arrangement (amounting to an \u2018establishment\u2019 for the purposes of Art 3(1)) if that employee or agent acts with a sufficient degree of stability. Conversely, when an employee is based in the EU but the processing is not being carried out in the context of the activities of the EU-based employee in the Union (i.e. the processing relates to activities of the controller outside the EU), the mere presence of an employee in the EU will not result in that processing falling within the scope of the GDPR.\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3)', 12 November 2019 (Version 2.1), page 6. However, this concept is not 'without limit' and cannot lead to the conclusion that a \" non-EU entity has an establishment in the Union merely because the undertaking\u2019s website is accessible in the Union \u201d. [ 6 ] Equally, the mere placement of data processing equipment in the EU is not an 'establishment', as there is no human activity. In conclusion, if a controller or processor established outside the Union exercises \u201c a real and effective activity - even a minimal one \u201d - through 'stable arrangement', regardless of its legal form (e.g. subsidiary, branch, office), in the territory of a Member State, this controller or processor can be considered to have an establishment in that Member State. [ 7 ] Common mistake: The location of the processing itself is irrelevant to determine the geographical scope of Article 3(1) GDPR. As explained by the EDPB, geographical location is only relevant to answer whether a controller or processor is established within or outside the Union, and whether a non-EU controller or processor has an establishment in the Union. An establishment in the Union may be considered irrelevant if, and only if, the establishment is not related to the processing of personal data. For example: A Brazilian company operates in different areas. It has an IT operation that is only active in South America, but also owns a construction company in the EU. The IT operation does not fall under the GDPR, just because there is an unrelated establishment in the EU. Article 3(1) confirms that it is not necessary that the processing in question is carried out 'by' the relevant EU establishment itself. The controller or processor will be subject to obligations under the GDPR whenever the processing is carried out 'in the context of the activities' of its relevant establishment in the Union. In this regard, the CJEU has followed a broad interpretation and already provided some guidance. In C-210/16 - Wirtschaftsakademie , the CJEU stated (with regard to the previous Directive 95/46/EC) that processing carried out in the context of the activities of the controller\u2019s establishment \u201c cannot be interpreted restrictively \u201d and that processing \u201c does not require that such processing be carried out \u2018by\u2019 the establishment concerned itself, but only that it be carried out \u2018in the context of the activities of\u2019 the establishment \u201d. [ 8 ] In C\u2011230/14 - Weltimmo the CJEU confirmed that the concept \u201c cannot be interpreted restrictively \u201d. [ 9 ] In C\u2011131/12 - Google Spain Google US had a sales office in Spain, selling advertisement of the US mother company. While the local office was not itself processing personal data of users, nonethleless, the CJEU found that this was an establishment sufficiently linked with the search engine to make Directive 95/46/EG applicable. [ 8 ] EDPB Guidelines suggests that two factors may help in determining whether processing occurs in the context of an establishment in the Union: The first one is the relationship between the non-EU entity and its local establishment in the Union. If a case-by-case analysis on the facts shows that there is an 'inextricable link' between the processing of personal data carried out by a non-EU controller or processor and the activities of an EU establishment, EU law will apply to that processing by the non-EU entity, whether or not the EU establishment plays a role in that processing of data. The second factor concerns whether or not the local establishment in the EU contributes to the revenues of the non-EU entity. This may potentially be the case, for example, for any foreign operator with a sales office or some other presence in the EU, even if that office has no role in the actual data processing, in particular where the processing takes place in the context of the sales activity in the EU and the activities of the establishment are aimed at the inhabitants of the Member States in which the establishment is located. [ 10 ] At the same time, the EDPB has stated that this requirement should not be interpreted too broadly so as to conclude that the existence of any presence in the EU, with even the remotest links to the data processing activities of a non-EU entity, will be sufficient to bring this processing within the scope of EU data protection law. \"On the other hand, the existence of an establishment within the meaning of the GDPR should not be interpreted too broadly to conclude that the existence of any presence in the EU with even the remotest links to the data processing activities of a non-EU entity will be sufficient to bring this processing within the scope of EU data protection law. Some commercial activity carried out by a non-EU entity within a Member State may indeed be so far removed from the processing ofpersonal data by this entity that the existence of the commercial activity in the EU would not be sufficient to bring the data processing by the non-EU entity within the scope of EU data protection law.\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3)', 12 November 2019 (Version 2.1), page 7. For example: When an employee is based in the EU but the processing is not being carried out in the context of the activities of the EU-based employee in the Union (i.e. the processing relates to activities of the controller outside the EU), the mere presence of an employee in the EU will not result in that processing falling within the scope of the GDPR. [ 11 ] If the controller or the processor is not established in the EU, the GDPR can nonetheless be triggered if personal data of individuals located in the Union are being processed. For example: A Chinese citizen is located in Berlin. If their behaviour is monitored by an app, the GDPR applies. In light of Recital 14 GDPR and the EDPB guidelines, the targeting criterion covers any natural person located in the Union to the extent that they are subject to processing, as described in Article 3(2)(a) and (b) GDPR. Common mistake: The application of the GDPR does in no way depend on the citizenship of data subjects. Given that the fundamental right to data protection under Article 8 of the Charter is a human right, it applies to all humans equally. The requirement that the data subject be located in the Union must be assessed at the moment in time when the relevant trigger activity takes place, such as the moment when goods or services are offered, or the moment when the behavior of the data subject is being monitored (letters (a) and (b) below). The processing activities related to data subjects in the Union must have taken place intentionally, rather than inadvertently or incidentally. [ 12 ] Just having a data subject that is located in the Union is however not enough. In addition, the processing has to 'relate to' one of two alternatives to make the GDPR applicable. Merely relating to an activity is again calling for a wide interpretation. The processing must not be 'aimed at', be 'necessary for' or alike, but must merely 'relate to' one of the following activities: The concept of 'goods and services' has been clarified in EU law (e.g. Directive 2006/123/EC on services in the internal market ) and case law, inter alia on the interpretation of Articles 28 to 37 and 56 to 62 TFEU . 'Goods' are products which can be valued in money and which are capable, as such, of forming the subject of commercial and lawful transactions. [ 13 ] 'Services' are activities developed by the provider and directed to a recipient, typically for remuneration. [ 14 ] This includes \u201c any Information Society service, that is to say, any service normally provided for remuneration, at a distance, by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of services \u201d; [ 15 ] as also supported by the EDPB. [ 16 ] Recital 23 GDPR highlights that it must be 'apparent' that the controller or processor is offering goods or services in the EU. This limitation is not directly supported by the text of the GDPR. Typical signs that a controller or processor apparently offers goods and services in Europe are, for example: the offering of languages that are not typically spoken in third countries (like German, Polish, Italian or Scandinavian Languages); the option to pay in Euros or other local currencies in the Union; the use of a Top Level Domain that is linked to an EU Member State (such as \".fr\"); or the option to have goods delivered to the EU. The mere possibility that the website of a controller or processor can be visited is not in itself sufficient to prove intention to offer goods or services. For example: The website of a local newspaper in Canada can be accessed from the EU. The newspaper only covers local stories, does not offer subscriptions outside of the local province and does not have advertisement aimed at EU residents. The GDPR does not apply to the local newspaper. At the same time a major global newspaper like the New York Times would clearly serve the European market and must apply the GDPR in relation to data subjects based in the EU. For example: An online shop from Chile offers products worldwide. Products are offered to anyone in the EU and the goods are shipped to European addresses and payable in Euro. The shop is available in Spanish, but also in English, French, German, Polish and Italian. The GDPR applies to this online shop. The matter of sufficient targeting of a local market is debated in relation to Article 17(1)(c) of the Brussels-I-Regulation 1215/2012, which regulates the jurisdiction of national courts in consumer contracts. There is a body of case law defining if a company \"directs activities\" towards a Member State. This case law seems to be instructive in the interpretation of Recital 23 GDPR. Contrary to the usual definition of good and services, the GDPR clarifies that processing is covered \" irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required \". This is intended to ensure that many free services that use personal data as an alternative revenue stream are also covered by the GDPR, if these services are offered on the European market. For example: A small online games provider from Turkey offers a game that is free to use and makes profits with advertisement in the game. It is very popular in Germany among the large Turkish diaspora. The GDPR applies to the processing of personal data of these users. The GDPR also becomes applicable if the behaviour of persons based in the EU is monitored. This is especially relevant for online advertisement and other business models that are based on user tracking. The monitoring of data subjects\u2019 behaviour is not defined in the GDPR. Recital 24 GDPR nevertheless clarifies that \u201c [i]n order to determine whether a processing activity can be considered to monitor the behaviour of data subjects, it should be ascertained whether natural persons are tracked on the internet including potential subsequent use of personal data processing techniques which consist of profiling a natural person, particularly in order to take decisions concerning her or him or for analysing or predicting her or his personal preferences, behaviours and attitudes \u201d. The EDPB has expanded the scope of this to include not only tracking of a person on the internet, but also tracking through other kinds of network or technologies which involve personal data processing, for instance, tracking through the use of wearables or smart devices. [ 17 ] The GDPR applies to the processing of personal data by a controller not established in the Union if the Member State\u2019s legislation applies by virtue of public international law. Recital 25 GDPR gives the example of processing taking place in a \u201c Member State\u2019s diplomatic mission or consular post \u201d. The EDPB gives as a further example the case of a German cruise ship travelling in international waters. By virtue of public international law, the GDPR will apply even though the ship is in international waters. [ 18 ] The GDPR is not an isolated law. In many ways controllers, processors and data subjects are also subject to various other national, EU or even international laws. The GDPR sometimes provides for national 'opening clauses', so that Member States can regulate certain - especially sensitive - aspects of data processing nationally. For example, matters of freedom of speech, data processing in the employment context, or freedom of information are left to the Member States in Articles 85 to 91 GDPR. Equally, the Member States can implement restrictions on the rights under various Articles, if these restrictions are in the public interest of the Member State ( Article 23 GDPR ). Despite early criticism, the GDPR does not regulate the territorial application of such opening clauses or restrictions, but leaves them to national law itself. In the case of most national law that uses a restriction or opening clauses, you have to refer to the territorial scope of the national law, or even general rules of international law to determine its application. For example: The Austrian Data Protection Act ('Datenschutzgesetz') regulates the use of personal data by journalists in \u00a7 9 Data Protection Act, as made possible by the opening clause in Article 85 GDPR . The Austrian law does not, however, specify the geographic application of the Data Protection Act. Under Article 49 of the Austrian Constitution, Austrian laws generally apply to the territory of Austria. It is unclear if Austrian journalists can use this privilege when publishing personal data in other Member States, or if journalists of other Member States have to follow the law of Austria if their journalistic activity expands to the territory of Austria. Similar examples can be found in many situations where opening clauses are used in cross-border contexts and requires additional research on the territorial application of national laws using such opening clauses. A similar issue occurs when the GDPR simply refers to applicable national law as a preliminary question under a GDPR provision. In some situations where the GDPR refers to national law, such as contract law in Article 6(1)(b) GDPR there are existing EU law provisions, like the Rome-I-Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 on the applicable contractual law. For example: A controller is located in Germany, the data subject is a consumer and located in Spain. Under EU regulations, Spanish law provisions for consumer protection apply. To determine if processing is necessary for a specific contract under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, the controller has to determine if the contract it has formed with the consumer is even valid under Spanish consumer protection law. Equally, you would have to consider applicable Member State law to determine if any processing of personal data is 'necessary' to comply with such an obligation under Article 6(1)(c) or (e) GDPR . Usually provisions in national law, EU law, or international law regulate the scope of such laws. For example: A controller is located in Member State A for tax reasons, but has subsidiaries with workers in Member States B and C. The controller may have to apply the income tax of Member State A, but also the employment tax law as well as the worker protection laws of A, B and C. Different processing of personal data may be 'necessary' depending on the legal requirements in each Member State. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 3 GDPR \u2191 EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3)\u2019, 12 November 2019 (Version 2.1), p. 4 (available here ). \u2191 EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3)\u2019, 12 November 2019 (Version 2.1), p. 6 (available here ). \u2191 EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3)\u2019, 12 November 2019 (Version 2.1), p. 6 (available here ). \u2191 CJEU, Case C-230/14, , Weltimmo , 1 October 2015, margin number 31 (available here ). \u2191 EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3)\u2019, 12 November 2019 (Version 2.1), p. 7 (available here ). \u2191 CJEU, Case C-191/15, Verein f\u00fcr Konsumenteninformation , 28 July 2016, margin number 76 (available here ). \u2191 Klar , in K\u00fchling/Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 3 GDPR, margin number 46 (C.H.

Codes of Conduct 4 Decisions 5 References 1.   The Member States, the supervisory authorities, the Board and the Commission shall encourage the drawing up of codes of conduct intended to contribute to the proper application of this Regulation, taking account of the specific features of the various processing sectors and the specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. 2.   Associations and other bodies representing categories of controllers or processors may prepare codes of conduct, or amend or extend such codes, for the purpose of specifying the application of this Regulation, such as with regard to: 3.   In addition to adherence by controllers or processors subject to this Regulation, codes of conduct approved pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article and having general validity pursuant to paragraph 9 of this Article may also be adhered to by controllers or processors that are not subject to this Regulation pursuant to Article 3 in order to provide appropriate safeguards within the framework of personal data transfers to third countries or international organisations under the terms referred to in point (e) of Article 46(2). Such controllers or processors shall make binding and enforceable commitments, via contractual or other legally binding instruments, to apply those appropriate safeguards including with regard to the rights of data subjects. 4.   A code of conduct referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall contain mechanisms which enable the body referred to in Article 41(1) to carry out the mandatory monitoring of compliance with its provisions by the controllers or processors which undertake to apply it, without prejudice to the tasks and powers of supervisory authorities competent pursuant to Article 55 or 56. 5.   Associations and other bodies referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article which intend to prepare a code of conduct or to amend or extend an existing code shall submit the draft code, amendment or extension to the supervisory authority which is competent pursuant to Article 55. The supervisory authority shall provide an opinion on whether the draft code, amendment or extension complies with this Regulation and shall approve that draft code, amendment or extension if it finds that it provides sufficient appropriate safeguards. 6.   Where the draft code, or amendment or extension is approved in accordance with paragraph 5, and where the code of conduct concerned does not relate to processing activities in several Member States, the supervisory authority shall register and publish the code. 7.   Where a draft code of conduct relates to processing activities in several Member States, the supervisory authority which is competent pursuant to Article 55 shall, before approving the draft code, amendment or extension, submit it in the procedure referred to in Article 63 to the Board which shall provide an opinion on whether the draft code, amendment or extension complies with this Regulation or, in the situation referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, provides appropriate safeguards. 8.   Where the opinion referred to in paragraph 7 confirms that the draft code, amendment or extension complies with this Regulation, or, in the situation referred to in paragraph 3, provides appropriate safeguards, the Board shall submit its opinion to the Commission. 9.   The Commission may, by way of implementing acts, decide that the approved code of conduct, amendment or extension submitted to it pursuant to paragraph 8 of this Article have general validity within the Union. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure set out in Article 93(2). 10.   The Commission shall ensure appropriate publicity for the approved codes which have been decided as having general validity in accordance with paragraph 9. 11.   The Board shall collate all approved codes of conduct, amendments and extensions in a register and shall make them publicly available by way of appropriate means. Article 40 GDPR opens Section 5 (Codes of Conduct and Certification) of Chapter 4 (Controller and Processor) and outlines the possibility to prepare codes of conducts (CoC) for the effective application of the GDPR, taking into account the specific features of various sectors and the specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. Article 40 GDPR is closely connected to Article 41 GDPR which stipulates the monitoring of approved codes of conduct. CoC are a voluntary accountability tool providing for specific data protection rules for categories of controllers and processors. In other words, CoC can provide a rule book for a group of controllers and processors describing how a GDPR compliant processing operation looks like in the specific processing situation. [ 1 ] Various actors are involved in setting up, monitoring and adhering to CoC. First, an association or other body representing categories of controllers or processors (i.e. \"Code Owners\" [ 2 ] ) creates the CoC. Second, the competent supervisory authority (i.e. Data Protection Authority; \"DPA\") approves the CoC (potentially involving the European Data Protection Board (\"EDPB\"), and the European Commission (EC)). Third, the controllers and processors which voluntarily undertake to apply the CoC. And finally, the body under Article 41(1) GDPR (\"Monitoring Body\") which monitors the compliance with the CoC. For the controllers and processors undertaking to apply the CoC of a give sector, adherence to the CoC is a measure to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR. [ 3 ] Article 40(1) GDPR is directed to Member States, the DPAs, the EDPB, and the EC and requires the encouragement of the drawing up of CoC. Article 40(2) GDPR provides for the option of Code Owners to draw up CoC. Further, this provisions lists examples of the scope of such CoC such as how the collection of personal data and the information provided to the public and to data subjects should take place. Article 40(3) GDPR is directed at controllers and processors that are not subject to the territorial scope of the GDPR and provides them with the option to enter into binding agreements to apply certain CoC in order to provide for appropriate safeguards within the framework of personal data transfers to third countries or international organisations under Article 46(2)(e) GDPR . Article 40(4) GDPR requires CoC to contain mechanisms which enable the monitoring body under Article 41(1) GDPR to carry out the mandatory monitoring of compliance with the CoC. Article 40(5) GDPR describes the approval mechanism for CoC and obliges Code Owners to submit the a draft of CoC to the competent DPA. The DPA then has to provide an opinion on whether the draft CoC comply with the GDPR and approves the CoC if it finds that it provides sufficient appropriate safeguards. Article 40(6) GDPR requires the competent DPAs to register and publish approved CoC which do not relate to processing activities in several Member States. Article 40(7) to (10) GDPR deal with the case that CoC relate to processing activities in several Member States and requires the competent DPA under Article 55 GDPR to submit the draft CoC to the EDPB in accordance with the consistency mechanism in Article 63 GDPR ; then, the EDPB has to provide an opinion regarding the draft CoCs compliance with the GDPR (Article 40(7) GDPR). In case the EDPB's opinion is positive, it submits the draft CoC to the EC (Article 40(8) GDPR) which may decide that the approved CoC have general validity within the Union (Article 40(9) GDPR. The EC must ensure appropriate publicity of such CoC (Article 40(10) GDPR). Lastly, in accordance with Article 40(11) GDPR, the EDPB must collate all approved CoC and make them publicly available. EDPB Guidelines : EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 1/2019 on Codes of Conduct and Monitoring Bodies under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 4 June 2019 (Version 2.0) (available here ), and EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 04/2021 on Codes of Conduct as tools for transfers\u2019 22 February 2022 (Version 2.0), (available here ). Article 40(1) GDPR requires (i) the Member States, (ii) the DPAs, (iii) the EDPB and (iv) the EC to encourage the drawing up of CoC intended to contribute to the proper application of the GDPR, taking account of the specific features of the various processing sectors and the specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. This provision requires its addressees to take some measures in order to encourage the drawing up of CoC. [ 4 ] This provision is addressed to the Member States, DPAs, the EDPB and the Commission. It is therefore not relevant for the the Code Owners, the controllers and processors undertaking to apply the CoC or the Monitoring Bodies. It should be recalled that CoC are a voluntary accountability tool and it is neither obligatory so draw them up not to undertake to apply them. In order to increase their presence and functionality in practice, Article 40(1) GDPR provides that some important actors (i.e. Member States, DPAs, the EDPB and the EC)  shall encourage the development of CoC. Therefore, while the development of CoC is voluntary, the addressees of this provision are obliged to encourage the usage of this instrument in order to contribute to the proper application of the GDPR. [ 5 ] For example, the EDPB's Guidelines on CoC can be considered a measure to facilitate their usage by, inter alia, clarifying the rules procedures and rules involved in the submission, approval and publication of CoC. [ 6 ] For more information on CoC themselves, see the Commentary or Article 40(2) GDPR. Article 40(1) GDPR clarifies that CoC must be tailored to \u201c specific features \u201d of a sector, as well as the \u201c specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises \u201d. Recital 98 and 99 GDPR provide additional information as to how the content of these CoC may be developed. The former highlights that the CoC should take into account \u201c risk likely to result from the [relevant] processing for the rights and freedoms of natural persons \u201d. According to the latter recital, the drafter \u201c should consult relevant stakeholders, including data subjects\u201d in order to develop these CoC. They should also duly consider the \u201c submissions received and views expressed in response to such consultations \u201d. See Commentary on Article 40(2) and (5) GDPR for more information on the scope of CoC. According to Article 40(2) GDPR, CoC are to be drafted by trade associations and other bodies \u201c representing categories of controllers or processors \u201d (i.e. Code Owners). [ 7 ] Generally, the Code Owners act as representatives of specific sectors. The EDPB lists trade and representative associations, sectoral organisations, academic organisations and interest groups as potential Code Owners. [ 8 ] \"Trade associations or bodies representing a sector can create codes to help their sector comply with the GDPR in an efficient and potentially cost effective way. \" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 1/2019 on Codes of Conduct and Monitoring Bodies under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 4 June 2019 (Version 2.0), margin number 8. Regarding the question, whether also other actors (e.g. a sole controller) can submit CoC, the EDPB notes that only an association/consortium of associations or other bodies representing categories of controllers or processors in accordance with Article 40(2) GDPR can submit CoC to the competent DPA and that such body has to demonstrate that the are an effective representative body and that they are capable of understanding the needs of their members and defining the respective processing activities of the sector. [ 9 ] Further, the EDPB notes that the representativeness of a Code Owner can be derived amongst others from the number (or percentage) of potential organisations applying the CoC in a given sector and the experience of the Code Owner with regard to the sector. Article 40(2) GDPR does not only apply to the initial preparation of CoC, rather it is also applicable to any amendments or extensions to existing CoC. Recital 99 of the GDPR emphasises that a Code Owner should consult relevant stakeholders when preparing a CoC (or a amendment or extension to it), including data subjects, and have regard to submissions received and views expressed in response to such consultations. It is important to clarify what is meant by CoCs. According to Article 40 GDPR, the purpose of a code of conducts is to \u201c[contribute] to the proper application \u201d, as well as to \u201c[specify] the application \u201d of the GDPR. Additionally, they may be developed to \u201c calibrate the obligations of controllers and processors \u201d according to Recital 98 GDPR. As such, codes are intended to be an additional (and voluntary) accountability tool which describes how a compliant processing operation in a particular sector should look like, acting as guard rails or a rule books for controllers and processors that fall within the scope of the GDPR (and in certain cases, see below, those who fall outside of it). The codes provide measures which data controllers and processors in a specific sector can implement in addition to, or to comply with, their existing legal obligations under the GDPR. [ 10 ] \"[CoCs] are voluntary accountability tools which set out specific data protection rules for categories of controllers and processors. They can be a useful and effective accountability tool, providing a detailed description of what is the most appropriate, legal and ethical set of behaviours of a sector. From a data protection viewpoint, codes can therefore operate as a rulebook for controllers and processors who design and implement GDPR compliant data processing activities which give operational meaning to the principles of data protection set out in European and National law.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 1/2019 on Codes of Conduct and Monitoring Bodies under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 4 June 2019 (Version 2.0), margin number 7. The focus on a particular sector is supposed to allow for a cost effective way to achieve data protection compliance by taking into account all the specific characteristics of processing carried out in that sector - with particular emphasis on the needs of micro, small and medium enterprises. [ 11 ] It should be recalled that under Article 24(3) GDPR , adherence to approved CoC can  be used as an element to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR. [ 12 ] \"Adherence to an approved code of conduct will also be a factor taken into consideration by supervisory authorities when evaluating specific features of data processing such as the security aspects, assessing the impact of processing under a DPIA or when imposing an administrative fine. In case of a breach of one of the provisions of the Regulation, adherence to an approved code of conduct might be indicative of how comprehensive the need is to intervene with an effective, proportionate, dissuasive administrative fine or other corrective measure from the supervisory authority.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 1/2019 on Codes of Conduct and Monitoring Bodies under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 4 June 2019 (Version 2.0), margin number 18. While adherence to approved CoC can increase data protection compliance and provide for some increased legal certainty for controllers and processors it is important to point out that even approved CoC are in wo way binding to DPA or courts and even a practice described in the CoC can later be considered unlawful. [ 13 ] Regarding the scope of CoC, the GDPR leaves a wide margin of discretion to Code Owners when drafting CoC; they can provide only for narrow rules on certain aspects or provide for wide-ranging rules for a particular sector. [ 14 ] In any case, a Code Owner must clearly specify the scope of the CoC when submitting them to the DPA for approval. [ 15 ] See Commentary on Article 40(4) GDPR for further requirements of CoC for their approval by the competent DPA. Article 40(2) GDPR provides for a non-exhaustive list of topics CoC could cover: (a) fair and transparent processing; (b) the legitimate interests pursued by controllers in specific contexts; (c) the collection of personal data; (d) the pseudonymisation of personal data; (e) the information provided to the public and to data subjects; (f) the exercise of the rights of data subjects; (g) the information provided to, and the protection of, children, and the manner in which the consent of the holders of parental responsibility over children is to be obtained; (h) the measures and procedures referred to in Articles 24 and 25 GDPR and the measures to ensure security of processing referred to in Article 32 GDPR; (i) the notification of personal data breaches to supervisory authorities and the communication of such personal data breaches to data subjects; (j) the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations; or (k) out-of-court proceedings and other dispute resolution procedures for resolving disputes between controllers and data subjects with regard to processing, without prejudice to the rights of data subjects pursuant to Articles 77 GDPR and 79 GDPR. Generally speaking, CoC developed in accordance with Article 40 GDPR are aimed at categories of controllers and processors within the scope of application of the GDPR. These categories are determined by their varying processing sectors. For example, a CoC for processing of personal data by banks would differ from one for the education sector. This is clear from the wording of Article 40(1) GDPR, which specifies that the codes should take into account \u201c the specific features of the various processing sectors \u201d. However, Article 40(3) GDPR provides that certain CoC can be followed by controllers and processors of personal data that are not subject to the GDPR pursuant to Article 3 GDPR (i.e. its territorial scope). This could enable an appropriate safeguard for the transfer of personal data to a third country or an international organisation in accordance with Article 46(2)(e) GDPR . Such CoC must not only be approved by the competent DPAs per Article 40(5) GDPR, but must also have gained general validity from the EC pursuant to Article 40(9) GDPR. The third country controllers and processors should also make \u201c binding and enforceable commitments \u201d (i.e. contractual or other legally binding instruments). [ 16 ] \"[CoC] may also provide to be a significant and useful mechanism in the area of international transfers. New provisions in the GDPR allow third parties to agree to adhere to approved codes in order to satisfy legal requirements to provide appropriate safeguards in relation to international transfers of personal data to third countries. Additionally, approved codes of this nature may result in the promotion and cultivation of the level of protection which the GDPR provides to the wider international community while also permitting sustainable legally compliant international transfers of personal data. They may also serve as a mechanism which further develops and fosters data subject trust and confidence in the processing of data outside of the European Economic Area.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 1/2019 on Codes of Conduct and Monitoring Bodies under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 4 June 2019 (Version 2.0), margin number 17 footnotes omitted. For this paragraph and its interaction with Article 40(2)(j) and 46(2)(e) GDPR, please see in particular Guidelines 04/2021 on Codes of Conduct as tools for transfers . [ 17 ] Article 40(4) GDPR outlines that a CoC must contain information on how a Monitoring Body (provided for in Article 41 GDPR ) can monitor the compliance of the CoC (i.e. the respective mechanism) by the controllers and processors which undertake to apply it. The Monitoring Body must be accredited by the competent DPA in accordance with Article 41(1) GDPR . It is important to note that such monitoring by these bodies should be carried out \u201c without prejudice to the tasks and powers of supervisory authorities \u201d, which means that the powers of such a monitoring body do not prevent the DPAs from using their own. See Commentary on Article 41 GDPR for more information on the Monitoring Body, its required procedures and structures. Article 40(5) GDPR outlines that Code Owners which \u201c intend to prepare a code of conduct or to amend or extend an existing [one] \u201d must submit their draft CoC to the competent DPA. Once the code owner has submitted the draft, amendment or extension, in either an electronic or written format, the competent DPA should review the CoC against the admissibility criteria and the conditions for approval which will be discussed in the following subsections. The DPA will then approve the CoCs, amendment or extension when it \u201c provides sufficient appropriate safeguards \u201d. Not much detail is provided by the provisions in the GDPR with regards to the admissibility criteria and conditions for approval. Therefore, much of the following discussion is derived from the EDPB Guidelines, which elaborate on these requirements. [ 18 ] Although Article 40(5) GDPR mentions that the competent DPA will be determined through the application of Article 55 GDPR, the GDPR does not provide specific rules on this. However, the EDPB Guidelines explain how Code Owners may identify the competent DPA in its Appendix 2. This document provides factors that can be considered such as: where most of the processing activity takes place, or where the processing sector is predominant; where data subjects are most affected; where the drafting association or other body has its headquarters; where the monitoring body will have its headquarters; where a DPA has developed initiatives in the CoC\u2019s specific field. [ 19 ] \"The [competent DPA's] role includes, inter alia, acting as a single point of contact with the code owners during the approval process, managing the application procedure in its cooperation phase, accrediting the monitoring body (if relevant) and acting as the supervisory lead in ensuring that an approved code is being monitored effectively.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 1/2019 on Codes of Conduct and Monitoring Bodies under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 4 June 2019 (Version 2.0), p. 28. The EDPB Guidelines provide a series of conditions that Code Owners should fulfil before considering submitting their CoC, amendment or extension to the competent DPA for approval. The content of the draft CoC, amendment or extension will not be reviewed further if it fails to fulfil the criteria for admissibility outlined below. [ 20 ] The first step for admissibility of draft CoC is to have a \u201c clear and concise explanatory statement \u201d. This will include an explanation of: the purpose of the CoC; the scope of the CoC; and the way in which it will foster compliance with the GDPR. Supporting documentation will also provide additional clarity. [ 21 ] The draft CoC must be drafted by an association or other bodies representing categories of controllers and processors (Article 40(2) GDPR). The EDPB highlights that Code Owners must demonstrate to the competent DPA that they fall within the meaning of \u201c associations and other bodies \u201d before submitting the CoC for approval. The Guidelines add that this entails providing proof of their capability to address the needs of controllers and processors and understanding of their processing activities. [ 22 ] The scope of application of the CoC must be sufficiently precise. This includes information on the type of processing performed, and the controllers and processors targeted by it. The drafters must clarify whether the code applies to processing within one or several Member States. This will then facilitate the determination of whether further steps must be taken (eg. general validity from the EC, as elaborated upon in Article 40(9) GDPR). [ 23 ] The Code Owner must similarly ensure that steps for monitoring compliance are clearly laid out in the CoC. They must also provide for a monitoring body and the mechanisms that this body will apply to ensure compliance with it. The Code Owner must consult relevant stakeholders such as data subjects, as well as controllers and processors, before the draft is considered admissible. [ 24 ] If national legislation applies, Code Owners must confirm that the CoC does not infringe such provisions. According to the EDPB, this is particularly the case if the code involves a sector which is specifically regulated by national law, or the processing at stake is subject to specific assessment requirements under national law. [ 25 ] The CoC must be written in the language in which the competent DPA works in. Transnational CoC, [ 26 ] however, should also have an English version of the CoC, in addition to one in the competent DPA\u2019s language. [ 27 ] The Code Owner must ensure that they fulfil all the above conditions before submitting the CoC for approval. Appendix 3 of the EDPB Guidelines provides a possible checklist for a Code Owner to verify this. They can then present it to the competent DPA. [ 28 ] The EDPB Guidelines also provide a series of criteria that must be fulfilled by Code Owners in order to gain formal approval for their CoC, amendment or extension from the competent DPA. The following sections reflect the minimum cumulative requirements for approval. First, the CoC must address a specific need or a data protection issue that is common in a sector, or in relation to a processing activity by a category of controllers or processors. The Code Owner must also demonstrate that it understands relevant processing issues, and clearly show how the CoC proposes to resolve them in an \u201c effective and beneficial \u201d way for their members and for data subjects. Without this, the CoC cannot get approval from the competent DPA. [ 29 ] Second, the Code Owner must ensure that the code \u201c facilitate[s] the effective application of this Regulation \u201d in the sector or processing activity it seeks to address. [ 30 ] \"In this regard, a code will need to clearly stipulate its sector-specific application of the GDPR and identify and address such specific needs of a sector.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 1/2019 on Codes of Conduct and Monitoring Bodies under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 4 June 2019 (Version 2.0), margin number 35. Third, according to the EDPB Guidelines, in order to gain approval, the Code Owner must ensure that the CoC specifies how the GDPR should apply in relation to the targeted processing activities or sector. This includes providing (non-exhaustively): clear improvements to ensure the targeted sector complies with the GDPR; realistic and attainable standards for the controllers and processors targeted; detailed information on data protection areas, such as those outlined in Article 40(2) GDPR; sufficiently clear and effective solutions to concerns over processing in this sector; an \u201c operational meaning \u201d of the Article 5 GDPR principles; and clarifications on any EDPD opinions or guidance for the specific sector. [ 31 ] The EDPB also clarifies that a Code Owner cannot simply restate provisions within the GDPR. The CoC must supplement the GDPR by providing information on how it \u201c shall apply in a specific, practical and precise manner \u201d which relates to the processing activity or sector at the heart of the CoC. This can be achieved by using, for example, sector-specific terminology without being too \u201c legalistic \u201d, and by giving examples of good practices. [ 32 ] Fourth, as outlined in Article 40(5) GDPR, the CoC must provide sufficient appropriate safeguards, \u201c taking into account the risk likely to result from the processing for the rights and freedoms of natural persons \u201d (Recital 98 GDPR). [ 33 ] Finally, an oversight and compliance monitoring mechanism is a requirement stipulated under Article 40(4) GDPR. According to the EDPB, structures and procedures for enforcing the CoC must be stipulated by the Code Owner before gaining approval. This includes identifying a Monitoring Body within the meaning of Article 41 GDPR . Such monitoring mechanisms must be \u201c clear, suitable, attainable, efficient and enforceable (testable) \u201d, according to the Guidelines. [ 34 ] Subject to the Code Owners fulfilling the admissibility and approval requirements outlined above, the competent DPA can approve the draft CoC, amendment or extension pursuant to Article 40(5) GDPR. The EDPB Guidelines suggest that the DPA should do so within a \u201c reasonable period of time \u201d (unless a specific time for approving a CoC is provided for in national law) and update the Code Owners throughout the approval process. The DPA should motivate its approval in line with the prerequisite criteria for admissibility and approval, and in cases when it does not approve a CoC, it should provide a reasoning for its opinion. This can then enable the Code Owners to redraft and re-submit the draft CoC if they wish to do so. [ 35 ] Article 40(6) GDPR requires the competent DPA to register and publish any approved CoC, amendment or extension of CoC unless they relate to processing activities in several Member States. Regarding CoC that relate to processing activities in several Member States, see Article 40(11) GDPR. The publication of CoC is in particular important for the data subjects involved in the respective processing activities. [ 36 ] Contrary to the approval by the DPA, the publication of the CoC is not a requirement for the validity of the CoC. [ 37 ] Article 40(7) to (10) GDPR deal with CoC relating to processing activities in several Member States. In particular, Article 40(7) GDPR stipulates that in case a draft CoC relates to processing activities in several Member States, the competent DPA [ 38 ] must, before approving the draft CoC, amendment or extension, submit it in the procedure referred to in Article 63 GDPR to the EPDB (i.e. the consistency mechanism) which must provide an opinion on whether the draft CoC, amendment or extension complies with the GDPR or, in the situation referred to in Article 40(3), provides appropriate safeguards. Similar to the case of national CoC, the competent DPA with which the Code Owner has submitted the draft CoC, must determine whether this CoC fulfils the admissibility criteria [ 39 ] before proceeding. After this initial step, according to the EDPB, the DPA should then notify other DPAs about the transnational CoC, pursuant to Article 40(7) GDPR; in order to let those other DPAs confirm whether they are \u201c supervisory authorities concerned \u201d (see Article 4(22)(a)(b) GDPR ): \"The [competent DPA] will immediately notify all other supervisory authorities of the submission of a code and provide the salient details which will allow for ease of identification and reference. All supervisory authorities should confirm by return whether they are concerned SAs as per Article 4(22) (a) and (b) of the GDPR.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 1/2019 on Codes of Conduct and Monitoring Bodies under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 4 June 2019 (Version 2.0), margin number 48 (footnotes omitted). Then, the DPAs will cooperate in a mechanism closely described in the EDPB Guidelines. [ 40 ] As per Article 40(7) GDPR, the competent DPA must then submit the draft CoC, amendment or extension to the EDPB which shall provide an opinion [ 41 ] on whether the draft CoC, amendment or extension complies with the GDPR or, in the situation referred to in 40(3) GDPR, provides appropriate safeguards. [ 42 ] In case the EDPB's opinion [ 43 ] regarding transnational CoC confirms that the CoC (or its amendment or extension) comply with the GDPR (or in in the situation referred to in 40(3) GDPR, provides appropriate safeguards), the EDPB has to submit its opinion to the EC in accordance with Article 40(8) GDPR. After receiving the EDPB\u2019s opinion, [ 44 ] the EC will be the one to determine, \u201c by way of implementing acts \u201d, whether to grant the transnational CoC \u201c general validity within the Union \u201d as per Article 40(9) GDPR. This provision specifies that the aforementioned \u201c implementing acts \u201d must be adopted in line with the examination procedure under Article 93(2) GDPR . [ 45 ] Should the EC grant the CoC general validity, there is no territorial limit to the CoC, [ 46 ] and the adherence by controllers or processors not subject to the GDPR due to its territorial scope can be considered an appropriate safeguard within the framework of personal data transfers to third countries or international organisations. [ 47 ] According to Article 40(10) GDPR, the EC is responsible for the \u201c appropriate publicity \u201d that should be given to a transnational CoC which has been granted general validity. This publication obligation exists in parallel to the EDPB's obligation to keep a register of all approved codes of conduct, amendments and extensions. [ 48 ] Article 40(11) GDPR stipulates that the EDPB shall keep a register on \u201c all approved codes of conduct, amendments and extensions \u201d which is freely accessible and available to all \u201c by way of appropriate means \u201d. The wording in Article 40(11) GDPR only specifically refers to \u201c approved codes \u201d without mentioning those with \u201c general validity \u201d, leading to some ambiguity as to the scope of this provision. Nonetheless, it is presumed that this requirement to register CoC applies to approved CoC within the meaning of Articles 40(5) and (6) GDPR, as well as CoC granted \u201c general validity \u201d by the EC as per Articles 40(7), (8), (9) and (10) GDPR. In other words, the EDPB has to publish national as well as transnational CoC. [ 49 ] The register can be found on the EDPB website.

Without prejudice to the tasks and powers of the competent supervisory authority under Articles 57 and 58, the monitoring of compliance with a code of conduct pursuant to Article 40 may be carried out by a body which has an appropriate level of expertise in relation to the subject-matter of the code and is accredited for that purpose by the competent supervisory authority. 2.   A body as referred to in paragraph 1 may be accredited to monitor compliance with a code of conduct where that body has: 3.   The competent supervisory authority shall submit the draft criteria for accreditation of a body as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article to the Board pursuant to the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63. 4.   Without prejudice to the tasks and powers of the competent supervisory authority and the provisions of CHAPTER VIII, a body as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall, subject to appropriate safeguards, take appropriate action in cases of infringement of the code by a controller or processor, including suspension or exclusion of the controller or processor concerned from the code. It shall inform the competent supervisory authority of such actions and the reasons for taking them. 5.   The competent supervisory authority shall revoke the accreditation of a body as referred to in paragraph 1 if the conditions for accreditation are not, or are no longer, met or where actions taken by the body infringe this Regulation. 6.   This Article shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities and bodies. You can help us fill this section! Article 41 GDPR is the second provision dealing with Codes of Conduct (\"CoC\") and is therefore closely connected to Article 40 GDPR which provides for more general provisions regarding CoC (in particular, the adoption and scope of CoC). Article 41 GDPR further elaborates and establishes rules on the monitoring of approved CoC. Therefore, it introduces the notion of the body monitoring the compliance with CoC (\"Monitoring Body\") as a significant player when it comes to adhering to CoC. A Monitoring Body must be accredited by the competent supervisory authority (DPA) and must have an appropriate level of expertise. It should be recalled that numerous actors are involved in setting up, monitoring and adhering to CoC. First, an association or other body representing categories of controllers or processors (i.e. \"Code Owners\" [ 1 ] ) creates the CoC. Second, the competent DPA approves the CoC (potentially involving the European Data Protection Board (\"EDPB\"), and the European Commission (EC)). Third, the controllers and processors which voluntarily undertake to apply the CoC. [ 2 ] Finally, and subject to this provision, the Monitoring Body which monitors the compliance with the CoC by the organisations which undertook to apply it. Therefore, the Monitoring Body has a supervising function. However, it should be pointed out that this does not limit the tasks and powers of the competent DPA in any way. [ 3 ] Article 41(1) GDPR states that the monitoring of compliance with CoC may be carried out by a Monitoring Body with an appropriate level of expertise regarding the CoC's subject matter. Further it requires Monitoring Bodies to be accredited by the competent DPA. Article 41(2) GDPR lists a Monitoring Body's requirements in order to be accredited to monitor compliance with CoC. Article 41(3) GDPR provides for the competent DPA's obligation to submit draft criteria for the accreditation of a Monitoring Body to the EDPB pursuant to the consistency mechanism under Article 63 et seqq. GDPR . Article 41(4) GDPR requires Monitoring Bodies to take appropriate action in cases a controller or processor infringed the CoC it undertook to adhere. Such action could including suspension or exclusion of the controller or processor concerned from the CoC. Further, the Monitoring Body has to inform the competent DPA accordingly. Article 41(5) GDPR obliges DPAs to revoke a Monitoring Body's accreditation if the conditions for accreditation are not or no longer met or when actions taken by the Monitoring Body infringe the GDPR. Finally, Article 41(6) GDPR stipulates that this provision does not apply to the processing carried out by public authorities or bodies. EDPB Guidelines : EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 1/2019 on Codes of Conduct and Monitoring Bodies under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 4 June 2019 (Version 2.0) (available here ), and EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 04/2021 on Codes of Conduct as tools for transfers\u2019 22 February 2022 (Version 2.0), (available here ). The Monitoring Body provided for in Article 41 GDPR is tasked with ensuring\u00a0compliance with the CoC as elaborated in Article 40 GDPR . This Monitoring Body must be accredited by the competent DPA but does not diminish the DPA's competences. Article 41(1) GDPR emphasises the fact that the monitoring of CoC by the Monitoring Body has no prejudice to the tasks and powers of the competent DPA under Articles 57 and 58 GDPR. Accordingly, the crucial role played by competent DPA in enforcing the GDPR, cannot be undermined by the existence of an accredited Monitoring Body ensuring compliance with a CoC for a specific sector or processing activity. While Article 41(1) GDPR states that the monitoring of compliance with a CoC \" may be \" carried out by a Monitoring Body, it must be pointed out that this is not just an option but obligatory. [ 4 ] Article 40(4) GDPR requires that CoC must contain mechanisms enabling the respective Monitoring Body to carry out the mandatory monitoring of compliance. Similarly, the EDPB points out that a CoC must identify a Monitoring Body in order to be admissible. [ 5 ] The Monitoring Body is tasked with conducting the obligatory monitoring of the compliance with the respective CoC by the organisations which undertook to adhere to the CoC. However, the Monitoring Body is not tasked with monitoring compliance of any data protection regulation not covered by the CoC. [ 6 ] In other words, the Monitoring Body's responsibility is limited by the scope of the CoC. The EDPB highlights that the GDPR does not prescribe the type of body which Article 41 GDPR refers to. Instead, the EDPB suggests that it is for Code Owners to define the structure of the Monitoring Body, including whether it is an internal or external one. For example, an internal body could be in the form of an \u201c ad hoc internal committee \u201d, or another department constituted independently from the Code Owners. [ 7 ] According to the wording of Article 41(1) GDPR, the monitoring body must have an \u201c appropriate level of expertise \u201d in the sector targeted by the CoC. This requirement is, however, undefined in the GDPR. \u201c Expertise \u201d is only referred to again under Article 41(2)(a) GDPR, although briefly, when again requiring the demonstration of expertise in relation to the subject-matter of the CoC. Therefore, see Commentary on Article 41(2)(a) GDPR for more information on the necessary level of expertise. Generally, the competent DPA has a wide margin of discretion when it comes to the assessment of the appropriate level of expertise. [ 8 ] A Monitoring Body has to be accredited for a specific CoC. However, each Monitoring Body could be accredited for more than one CoC as long as it fulfils the requirements for each accreditation. [ 9 ] For information about the assessment of the competent DPA, see Commentary for Article 40(5) GDPR . \"The GDPR does not define the term \u2018accreditation\u2019. However, Article 41(2) of the GDPR outlines general requirements for the accreditation of the monitoring body. There are a number of requirements which should be met in order to satisfy the [competent supervisory authority] to accredit a monitoring body. Code owners will need to explain and demonstrate how their proposed monitoring body meets the requirements set out in Article 41(2) to obtain accreditation. The GDPR provides flexibility around the type and structure of a monitoring body  to be accredited under Article 41. Code owners may decide to use external or internal monitoring bodies provided that in both cases the relevant body meets the accreditation requirements of Article 41(2) as outlined in the eight requirements listed below.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 1/2019 on Codes of Conduct and Monitoring Bodies under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 4 June 2019 (Version 2.0), margin number 61 et seq. The GDPR requires that the competent DPA accredit a Monitoring Body before it can perform its task according to the respective CoC. [ 10 ] Article 41(2) GDPR provides a list of requirements a Monitoring Body must fulfil. However, it should be noted that, in addition to the requirements listed in Article 41(2) GDPR, the competent DPA has to draft and publish the criteria for accreditation of Monitoring Body in accordance with Article 57(1)(p) GDPR . Regarding the requirements drafted by the competent DPA's, the consistency mechanism under Article 64 et seqq. GDPR has to be applied. [ 11 ] Therefore, the requirements set out in in the competent DPA's published criteria will further elaborate on the criteria mentioned in Article 41(2) and might add additional requirements. [ 12 ] In any case, the following criteria directly listed in Article 41(2) GDPR must be fulfilled by a Monitoring Body,\u00a0 and it is the Code Owner\u2019s task\u00a0to demonstrate that their chosen Monitoring Body fulfils them. [ 13 ] Article 41(1)(a) GDPR requires that the Monitoring Body demonstrated its independence to the satisfaction of the competent DPA . According to the EDPB, this requirement for accreditation refers to the Monitoring Body\u2019s impartiality of function from the organisation which undertake to apply the CoC and the profession, industry or sector in question. [ 14 ] The EDPB also provides some suggestions of areas that can be used to demonstrate independence. These are only examples, and are non-exhaustive: - \u00a0 independent funding; - \u00a0 independence in the appointment of the Monitoring Body\u2019s staff and management structure, such as though \u201c informational barriers \u201d or \u201c separate reporting management structures \u201d; - \u00a0 independence in its processes for making decisions, with the willingness to impose sanctions for non-compliance with the code; and/or - \u00a0 independence in the organisational structure of the Monitoring Body. [ 15 ] The requirement of independence evidently applies regardless of whether an internal or external Monitoring Body is chosen by the Code Owners. Again, the threshold for this level of independence is \u201c to the satisfaction of the competent supervisory authority \u201d. Therefore, it is possible for there to be divergences between Member States as well. However, the EDPB also provides some guidance in that respect. For example, the monitoring body should be able to demonstrate that it will act without instructions or fear of reprimand from third parties. Similarly, it must be able to show that it has implemented safeguards so as to mitigate any risk with regards to its impartiality. [ 16 ] Already Article 41(1) GDPR stipulates that the Monitoring Body must have an \u201c appropriate level of expertise \u201d in the subject matter the CoC aims to ensure effective compliance with. Article 41(2)(a) GDPR further requires that the Monitoring Body demonstrated its expertise to the satisfaction of the competent DPA . Therefore, the DPA has a wide margin of discretion even though it has to further specify this requirement in the draft criteria for accreditation the competent DPA has to publish in accordance with Article 41(3) GDPR which has to undergo the consistency mechanism. [ 17 ] However, the EDPB provides some guidance as to what this requirement entails. For example, it clarifies that the monitoring body should show that it has knowledge of, and past experience in, the sector targeted by the code of conduct. Similarly, the monitoring body should demonstrate an in-depth understanding of data protection law as applicable to the type of processing covered by the code of conduct. Experience in monitoring compliance is also recommended. [ 18 ] \"For example, being able to point to previous experience of acting in a monitoring capacity for a particular sector may assist in meeting this requirement. Furthermore, an in-depth understanding of data protection issues and expert knowledge of the specific processing activities which are the subject matter of the code will be welcomed. The staff of the proposed monitoring body should also have appropriate operational experience and training for carrying out the monitoring of compliance such as in the field of auditing, monitoring, or quality assurance activities.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 1/2019 on Codes of Conduct and Monitoring Bodies under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 4 June 2019 (Version 2.0), margin number 69. The monitoring body must also have procedures in place that enable them to (i) assess whether the controllers and processors are eligible to apply the code of conduct [ 19 ] as well as (ii) ensure their compliance with it and (iii) review its operation. These three requirements must be satisfied before a monitoring body can be accredited according to Article 41(1)(b) GDPR. Although this provision only refers to \u201c procedures \u201d and not \u201c structures \u201d, the EDPB has interpreted the paragraph as including both. The EDPB also interprets this provision to mean that \u201c comprehensive vetting procedures \u201d are required to assess whether the controllers and processors concerned can be considered as formally adhering to the code of conduct. Therefore, the EPDB provides suggestions of what these vetting procedures may look like: - \u00a0 randomised audits (these carry even more weight if published); - \u00a0 inspections on a regular basis (e.g. annually); - \u00a0 use of reports; and/or - \u00a0 use of questionnaires. [ 20 ] However, this is not a comprehensive list, and bodies seeking accreditation may adopt any procedure or structure that addresses the three requirements above. The EDPB also notes that the established procedures must be supported by sufficient monetary and human resources to be implemented effectively in practice. [ 21 ] \"Resources should be proportionate to the expected number and size of code members, as well as the complexity or degree of risk of the relevant data processing.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 1/2019 on Codes of Conduct and Monitoring Bodies under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 4 June 2019 (Version 2.0), margin number 73. As mentioned in the section above, Article 41(2)(b) GDPR requires that the Monitoring Body review the CoC. For this to be effectively achieved, the monitoring body must establish a procedure for doing so,\u00a0 which should in turn assess the code\u2019s relevance (in particular, In light of any sector-specific, industry and/or technological developments) and its contribution to \u201c the proper application of the GDPR \u201d. [ 22 ] Additionally, Article 41(1)(c) GDPR stipulates that the Monitoring Body must have clear procedures and structures to address complaints regarding infringements or poor implementation of the CoC by a controller or processor. To achieve this, sufficient resources and powers are crucial. Additionally, the willingness to impose corrective measures (such as the suspension of a membership to the CoC) is also necessary. [ 23 ] If a code member breaks the rules of the code, the monitoring body is obliged to take immediate suitable measures. The aim of suitable corrective measures will be to stop the infringement and to avoid future recurrence. Such remedial actions and sanctions could include such measures ranging from training to issuing a warning, report to the Board of the member, a formal notice requiring the implementation of specific actions within a specified deadline, temporary suspension of the member from the code until remedial action is taken to the definitive exclusion of such member from the code. These measures could be publicised by the monitoring body, especially where there are serious infringements of the code. EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 1/2019 on Codes of Conduct and Monitoring Bodies under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 4 June 2019 (Version 2.0), margin number 76. Article 41(1)(c) GDPR also requires that those procedures and structures must be made transparent to the data subject and to the general public. This entails that the Monitoring Body has a publicly accessible complaints handling processes . It may also imply, where relevant, communication to concerned parties and DPAs. [ 24 ] Article 41(2)(d) GDPR stipulates that the Monitoring Body hast to demonstrate that its tasks and duties do not result in a conflict of interests. The EDPB specifies that it is necessary to sho that the Monitoring Body will refrain from any action that is incompatible with its tasks and duties and that safeguards are put in place to ensure that will not engage with an incompatible occupation. [ 25 ] \"[T]he monitoring body must remain free from external influence, whether direct or indirect, and shall neither seek nor take instructions from any person, organisation or association. The body should have its own staff which are chosen by them or some other body independent of the code and it should be subject to the exclusive direction of those bodies only. In the case of an internal monitoring body, it shall be protected from any sort of sanctions or interference (whether direct or indirect) by the code owner, other relevant bodies, or members of the code as a consequence of the fulfilment of its tasks.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 1/2019 on Codes of Conduct and Monitoring Bodies under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 4 June 2019 (Version 2.0), margin number 68 (footnotes omitted). According to Article 41(3) GDPR, the competent DPA (which is also in charge of later assessing whether a Monitoring Body satisfies the accreditation criteria) must submit draft criteria for accreditation to the EDPB in line with the consistency mechanism under Article 63 GDPR . In accordance with Article 64(1)(c) GDPR , the EDPB has to issue an opinion on the draft criteria for accreditation submitted by a DPA. The EDPB's role is mainly to ensure the consistent application of the GDPR when the DPAs adopt requirements for the accreditation of Monitoring Bodies and to contribute to a harmonised approach with regard to the requirements that DPAs apply during the accreditation of Monitoring Bodies. [ 26 ] As highlighted by the EDPB, any draft criteria for accreditation should fully address the criteria outlined in Article 41(2) GDPR and should be in line with the eight areas outlined by the EDPB: Independence, Conflict of interest, Expertise, Established procedures and structures Transparent complaints handling Communication with the competent DPA, Review mechanism, and Legal status. [ 27 ] However, it should be noted that the level of detail of such draft criteria is necessarily limited since each specific accreditation should take into account the CoC's specific sector and specificities. [ 28 ] The role that a Monitoring Body in monitoring compliance with CoC is outlined, inter alia, in Article 41(4) GDPR. However, reference should also be made to Article 41(2) GDPR which make clear that the Monitoring Body has to monitor compliance with the CoC by the controllers and processors which undertook to uphold it and to handle complaints about infringements of the CoC. [ 29 ] Article 41(4) GDPR further stipulates that the Monitoring Body has to take appropriate action in cases of infringement of the code by a controller or processor. Such action can include suspension or exclusion of the respective controller or processor from the CoC. Article 41(4) GDPR further requires the Monitoring Body to inform the competent DPA of such action. Due to the similar wording, see Commentary on Article 41(1) GDPR. In essence, this provision stipulates that the Monitoring Body's supervision of compliance with a CoC does not reduce the competences of the DPA; in particular in connection with Chapter VIII (remedies, liability and penalties). Monitoring Bodies are not just obliged to monitor compliance with the CoC. Rather, in case of an infringement against the CoC, the Monitoring Body has to take appropriate action . According to Article 41(4) GDPR, such action can include the respective controller's suspension or exclusion from the CoC. However, the action taken by the Monitoring Body should be aimed at stopping the infringement and avoid the risk of repetition of such infringement. [ 30 ] It should be recalled that the Monitoring Body is only competent for controllers and processors who undertook to comply with the CoC. Accordingly, the Monitoring Body is not competent for practices contrary to the CoC by controllers or processors who fall in the CoC's scope but did not undertook to adhere it. [ 31 ] The Monitoring Body's obligation to take appropriate actions in case of an infringement of the CoC is subject to appropriate safeguards. In other word, the Monitoring Body can refrain from taking action in case of an infringement if the controller or processor can eliminate the necessity of any action by the Monitoring Body by implementing appropriate safeguards, e.g. by implementing the necessary actions on their own initiative. [ 32 ] Under Article 41(4) GDPR, a Monitoring Body has an obligation to communicate to the competent DPA any action it takes in the event of an infringement. It must also provide the reasoning behind this action. The EDPB suggests that this requirement for Monitoring Bodies should be considered a criterion for accreditation. [ 33 ] The requirement to inform the competent DPA is applicable irrespective of whether the Monitoring Body considers further action by the DPA necessary or not since this is subject solely to the DPA's assessment. [ 34 ] Article 41(5) GDPR stipulates that the competent DPA which approved the Monitoring Body may also revoke its accreditation. This occurs when the conditions for accreditation are no longer fulfilled. Additionally, revocation of the accreditation is also a remedy for any infringement of the GDPR carried out by the Monitoring Body. According to the EDPB, Code Owners should set out suitable provisions to address such a revocation. [ 35 ] Additionally, because of the severe consequences this can entail (e.g. the suspension of the CoC due to the absence of a Monitoring Body), the DPA should, when appropriate, give the Monitoring Body the opportunity to remedy the concern identified. [ 36 ] Since the monitoring by a Monitoring Body is a requirement for the applicability of CoC, the revocation of a Monitoring Body's accreditation generally results to the inapplicability of (the effects of) the CoC. [ 37 ] \"[T]he consequences of revoking the accreditation of the sole monitoring body for a [CoC] may result in the suspension, or permanent withdrawal, of that [CoC] due to the loss of the required compliance monitoring. Where circumstances permit, revocation should only take place after the [competent DPA] has given the monitoring body the opportunity to urgently address issues or make improvements as appropriate within an agreed timescale. In cases which involve transnational codes, the [competent DPA] should, before agreeing to setting parameters with the monitoring body to address the issues raised, liaise with concerned [supervisory authorities] on the matter. The decision to revoke a monitoring body should also be  communicated to all concerned [supervisory authorities] and the Board (for the purposes of Article 40(11)).\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 1/2019 on Codes of Conduct and Monitoring Bodies under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 4 June 2019 (Version 2.0), margin number 86 et seq. As Article 41(6) GDPR clearly lays out, this provision does not apply to processing carried out by public authorities and bodies. \"In essence, this provision removes the requirement for an accredited body to monitor a code. This exemption does not in any way dilute the requirement for the implementation of effective mechanisms to monitor a code. This could be achieved by adapting existing audit requirements to include monitoring of the code.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 1/2019 on Codes of Conduct and Monitoring Bodies under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 4 June 2019 (Version 2.0), margin number 88. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 41 GDPR \u2191 See definition used by the EDPB: EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 1/2019 on Codes of Conduct and Monitoring Bodies under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 4 June 2019 (Version 2.0), p. 7 (available here ). \u2191 See Commentary on Article 40 GDPR for more information on these actors. \u2191 See Article 41(1) and (4) GDPR. \u2191 Bergt, Pesch , in K\u00fchling, Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 41 GDPR, margin number 3 (C.H.

The Member States, the supervisory authorities, the Board and the Commission shall encourage, in particular at Union level, the establishment of data protection certification mechanisms and of data protection seals and marks, for the purpose of demonstrating compliance with this Regulation of processing operations by controllers and processors. The specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises shall be taken into account. 2.   In addition to adherence by controllers or processors subject to this Regulation, data protection certification mechanisms, seals or marks approved pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article may be established for the purpose of demonstrating the existence of appropriate safeguards provided by controllers or processors that are not subject to this Regulation pursuant to Article 3 within the framework of personal data transfers to third countries or international organisations under the terms referred to in point (f) of Article 46(2). Such controllers or processors shall make binding and enforceable commitments, via contractual or other legally binding instruments, to apply those appropriate safeguards, including with regard to the rights of data subjects. 3.   The certification shall be voluntary and available via a process that is transparent. 4.   A certification pursuant to this Article does not reduce the responsibility of the controller or the processor for compliance with this Regulation and is without prejudice to the tasks and powers of the supervisory authorities which are competent pursuant to Article 55 or 56. 5.   A certification pursuant to this Article shall be issued by the certification bodies referred to in Article 43 or by the competent supervisory authority, on the basis of criteria approved by that competent supervisory authority pursuant to Article 58(3) or by the Board pursuant to Article 63. Where the criteria are approved by the Board, this may result in a common certification, the European Data Protection Seal. 6.   The controller or processor which submits its processing to the certification mechanism shall provide the certification body referred to in Article 43, or where applicable, the competent supervisory authority, with all information and access to its processing activities which are necessary to conduct the certification procedure. 7.   Certification shall be issued to a controller or processor for a maximum period of three years and may be renewed, under the same conditions, provided that the relevant requirements continue to be met. Certification shall be withdrawn, as applicable, by the certification bodies referred to in Article 43 or by the competent supervisory authority where the requirements for the certification are not or are no longer met. 8.   The Board shall collate all certification mechanisms and data protection seals and marks in a register and shall make them publicly available by any appropriate means. Article 42 GDPR offers a controller or processor the voluntary option to obtain a certification for their processing operations, in order to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR. Certification is thus viewed as an accountability framework, promoting both legal compliance and transparency. However, it is crucial to note that the mere demonstration of compliance within the certification process does not equal compliance per se: controllers and processors must still comply with the full scope of the GDPR, regardless of whether they have been certified or not. Similarly, certification does not reduce the responsibility which has been allocated to a controller or processor when it comes to their existing legal obligations under the GDPR. Article 42(1) GDPR provides that Member States, Data Protection Authorities (DPAs), the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) and the European Commission (Commission) shall encourage the \u201c establishment of data protection certification mechanisms \u201d. However, there is no definition of what a certification constitutes in the GDPR. Therefore, one can turn to the universal definition provided by the International Standards Organisation (ISO), which defines certification as \u201c the provision by an independent body of written assurance (a certificate) that the product, service or system in question meets specific requirements. \u201d [ 1 ] The EDPB Guidelines 1/2018 on certification and identifying certification criteria in accordance with Articles 42 and 43 of the Regulation (EDPB Guidelines), adopt the definition found in the ISO Conformity assessment EN-ISO/IEC 17000:2004, and define certification to mean \u201c third party attestation related to processing operations by controllers and processors \u201d. [ 2 ] However, the scope of this definition, and Article 42 GDPR in general, has been criticised for being limited to the entity that engages in the processing operation. [ 3 ] While this makes sense insofar as it is the data processing operation itself which is certified (as this is where the personal data is handled), one can also make the argument that the certification mechanism should be extended to entities providing products or services, but not conducting data processing themselves. [ 4 ] There is also no definition of \u201c data protection seals and marks \u201d to be found in the GDPR. Here, general definitions are to be relied upon as well. What is important to note, however, is that a certificate, seal or mark under the GDPR is only issuable following an independent assessment by a DPA or accredited certification body. This is clear from Article 42(5) GDPR, which details that the criteria through which to assess the controller or processor should be approved pursuant to Article 58(3) GDPR , or by the EDPB pursuant to Article 63 GDPR . Where such an approval takes place through the EDPB, this may give rise to a common certification known as the \u201c European Data Protection Seal \u201d. [ 5 ] Article 42(2) GDPR also provides that data protection certification mechanisms, seals, or marks approved pursuant to Article 42(5) GDPR can be established for the purpose of demonstrating the existence of appropriate safeguards provided by controllers or processors not subject to the GDPR, in order to allow for personal data transfers to third countries under the terms referred to in Article 46(2)(f) GDPR. One substantial difference between Article 42(1) GDPR and Article 42(2) GDPR is that in the former, the applicant for certification is subject to the GDPR, while in latter, the applicant is not. This entails that the certification body must ensure that an applicant not subject to the GDPR is nonetheless able to be monitored by it for compliance with its certification obligations. This follows from the wording of Article 42(2) GDPR, which specifies that such third-country controllers or processors should make binding and enforceable commitments to apply the safeguards upon which the certification was based on. In short, the certification body must be able to monitor and enforce these commitments. Article 42(3) GDPR specifies that the act of certification is voluntary, and that it must be an option that is available to controllers or processors via a process that is transparent. To aid with transparency, certification bodies which approve certification mechanisms, seals or marks, should provide easily accessible information about the certification process which is meaningful and intelligible. It is important to note that there is no obligation under the GDPR to become \u2018 certified \u2019 as a controller or processor, although certification can help demonstrate compliance with the GDPR. However, as Article 42(4) GDPR expressly makes clear, the act of becoming certified does not reduce the responsibility of the controller or processor in complying with the GDPR, and is without prejudice to the task and powers of the competent DPAs pursuant to Articles 55 and 56 GDPR . As expressed in Article 42(5) GDPR, the certification of a processing operation can be done either by the certification bodies referred to in Article 43 GDPR , or by the competent DPA.sIn any case, both must follow the certification criteria which will have previously been approved by the DPA or the EDPB. The fact that a certification was carried out by the certification body or the DPA, does not change much for the controller or processor seeking certification. However, when issuing a certification, the certification body and DPA must take into account the following things. A certification body must issue, review, renew and withdraw certifications (Articles 42(5) and 42(7) GDPR) on the basis of the certification criteria approved by the DPA or the EDPB. According to Article 42(7) GDPR, certification can be issued for a maximum period of three years. However, a certification body can also withdraw the certification, if the criteria for the certification are no longer being met. The certification body must provide DPAs with information regarding individual certifications, as this is necessary to monitor how the certification mechanism has been applied (Articles 42(7) GDPR, 43(5), and 58(2)(h) GDPR ). [ 6 ] According to the EDPB, where a DPA is to conduct certification pursuant to Article 42(5) GDPR, it will have to carefully assess its role regarding its assigned tasks under the GDPR. In particular, the separation of powers should be taken into account, to ensure that any conflicts of interest are avoided. The DPA must both ensure that a certification mechanism has been properly set up, and that it has either developed its own, or adopted a, certification criteria. Furthermore, certifications issued by the DPA are to be periodically reviewed (as required by Article 57(1)(o) GDPR ). The DPA can also withdraw a certification if its requirements are no longer being met, as provided for in Article 58(2)(h) GDPR . In order for processing operations to become certified, they need to be assessed with reference to certification criteria (Article 42(5) GDPR). These criteria must be approved either by the competent DPA, or the EDPB. The development of this certification criteria should focus on \u201c verifiability, significance, and suitability \u201d in order to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR. The EDPB also gives guidance on which aspects are to be taken into account when drafting certification criteria. These include: the lawfulness of processing pursuant to Article 6 GDPR ; the principles of data processing pursuant to Article 5 GDPR ; the data subjects\u2019 rights pursuant to Articles 12-23 GDPR ; the obligation to notify data breaches pursuant to Article 33 GDPR ; the obligation of data protection by design and by default, pursuant to Article 25 GDPR ; whether a data protection impact assessment, pursuant to Article 35(7)(d) GDPR has been conducted, if applicable; and the technical and organizational measures put in place pursuant to Article 32 GDPR . However, these aspects may be given varying weight and consideration, depending on what the scope of the certification is. [ 7 ] When a DPA is responsible for approving the certification criteria, it must do so prior to or during the accreditation process for a certification body. A DPA must not discriminate against any entity, and must ensure that it handles all requests for approval of certification criteria fairly. It must also make its procedure for approval publicly available. Once the certification criteria has been approved by the DPA , a certification body can only issue certification within a Member State in accordance with this criteria. Alternatively, the certification criteria can also be approved by the EDPB (in which case it will generate a European Data Protection Seal). However, the creation and approval of a European Data Protection Seal may prove complicated, and will be subject to continuous change, since an EU-wide mechanism will need to be adaptable to take into account national regulations that may be sector-specific. Once a set of criteriahas been identified as suitable for a common certification, and has also been approved by the EDPB, then certification bodies \u201c may be accredited to conduct certification under these criteria at Union level \u201d. [ 8 ] In identifying which processing operations can be certified, the EDPB suggests that three components are considered. These include: (i) The personal data involved; (ii) The technical systems used to process the personal data, and (iii) The processes and procedures related to the processing operations. Each processing operation is to be assessed against the set of certification criteria. It is also important to note that a use case must be provided in order to assess the compliance of the processing operation with the certification criteria. Once a processing operation has been certified, a certification can be issued to a controller or processor for a maximum of three years (Article 42(7) GDPR), and can be renewed if all of the criteria of the certification mechanism have been met. Article 42(8) GDPR requires that the EDPB collate all certification mechanisms and data protection seals and marks in a register, and make them publicly available by any appropriate means. The aim of this exercise is to promote transparency of the certification mechanism. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 42 GDPR \u2191 See the website of the ISO under \u201cCertification\u201d (accessed on 17 March 2022); also see EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 1/2018 on certification and identifying certification criteria in accordance with Articles 42 and 43 of the Regulation\u2019, 4 June 2019 (Version 3.0), p. 8 (available here ). \u2191 EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 1/2018 on certification and identifying certification criteria in accordance with Articles 42 and 43 of the Regulation\u2019, 4 June 2019 (Version 3.0), p. 8 (available here ). \u2191 Bergt, Pesch , in K\u00fchling, Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 42 GDPR, margin number 3a (C.H.

Article 43 GDPR explains the procedure involved in establishing certification bodies, in order to assist with the certification mechanisms laid out in Article 42 GDPR . As established in the aforementioned article, certification is a means through which controllers and processors can demonstrate compliance with their legal obligations under the GDPR. However, certification itself does not prove compliance, but rather only constitutes an element of it. To this end, certification bodies can assist controllers and processors with demonstrating their compliance by certifying their processing operations. Article 43(1) GDPR states that certification bodies with an \u2018 appropriate level of expertise \u2019 are to be tasked with issuing and renewing certification for processing operations, as detailed in Article 42 GDPR . Although the GDPR has not defined what would constitute this level of expertise, it seems that this may be left to the Data Protection Authority (DPA) or national accreditation body to determine. This is derived from the fact that a certification body must be accredited by either of the two aforementioned entities in order to begin certifying processing operations. In order for a certification body to become accredited, it must demonstrate that it has the necessary elements required for accreditation, listed in Articles 43(2)(a) to (e) GDPR. The body must be able to demonstrate independence and expertise \u201c to the satisfaction of the supervisory authority \u201d. It must also respect the certification criteria referred to in Article 42(5) GDPR . Furthermore, it must establish procedures for both issuing, reviewing, and withdrawing certifications, and for handling complaints regarding certification infringements. Finally, the certification body must also demonstrate that its tasks and duties do not result in conflicts of interests. Once a certification body has demonstrated these elements, it may apply to become accredited. Article 43(3) GDPR provides that the accreditation of certification bodies shall take place on the basis of the requirements (criteria) approved by the DPA or by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB). Article 43(4) states that, if an accreditation is issued, it is limited to five years in duration, and may be renewed on the same conditions provided that the certification body continues to meet the requirements for accreditation. Once accredited, the certification body can begin to carry out its functions of issuing and renewing certifications for controllers and processors. However, as per Article 43(5), for every acceptance or withdrawal of certification that the certification body oversees, it must inform the competent DPA of its reasons for doing so. If the certification body is no longer meeting the conditions for accreditation, both the competent DPA and the national accreditation body have the right to revoke its accreditation. In order to promote transparency, the criteria for certification should be made public by the supervisory authority in an easily accessible form. Here, the EDPB has also stated that certification bodies using certification mechanisms, seals or marks directed towards data subjects as consumers or customers, should also provide easily accessible and intelligible information about the processing operations it has certified. The information to be made transparent should include: a description of the target of evaluation (the processing operation), reference to the approved criteria which have been applied in the particular instance, which methodology has been used for evaluating the criteria, the duration of the validity of the certificate issued. [ 1 ] Articles 43(8) GDPR and Article 43(9) GDPR equip the European Commission (Commission) with the power to adopt acts in relation to certification mechanisms. While Article 43(8) GDPR deals with delegated acts for the purpose of specifying requirements to be taken into account for certification mechanisms, Article 43(9) GDPR deals with implementing acts which lay down technical standards for certification mechanisms. The delegated acts of Article 43(8) GDPR aim to specify the requirements taken into account for certification mechanisms. The Commission has interpreted this provision as presenting the opportunity to further flesh out the GDPR with regard to data protection certification mechanisms. However, the Commission reminds that Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) states that the content of these delegated acts should (1) complement the GDPR and be in compliance with it, and (2) only refer to non-essential elements of the legislation, which the law has not specified. [ 2 ] Alongside the power to adopt delegated acts, the Commission also has the power to adopt implementing acts. As mentioned in Recital 167 GDPR and Article 291 TFEU, the aim of implementing acts is to \u201c ensure uniform conditions for implementing \u201d the GDPR. In its GDPR Certification Study, the Commission has stated that the purpose of referring to technical standards in Article 43(9) for certification mechanisms is precisely to ensure uniformity of implementation. [ 3 ] Furthermore, Article 43(9) GDPR also allows the Commission to adopt mechanisms to promote and recognize data protection certification mechanisms, seals, and marks. This is to be read in light of Article 42(1) GDPR, which obliges the Commission to encourage the establishment of such mechanisms, seals, and marks. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 43 GDPR \u2191 EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 1/2018 on certification and identifying certification criteria in accordance with Articles 42 and 43 of the Regulation\u2019, 4 June 2019 (Version 3.0), pp. 19-20 (available here ). \u2191 European Commission, \u2018Data Protection Certification Mechanisms Study on Articles 42 and 43 of the Regulation (EU) 2016/679\u2019, February 2019, pp. 26-27 (available here ). \u2191 European Commission, \u2018Data Protection Certification Mechanisms Study on Articles 42 and 43 of the Regulation (EU) 2016/679\u2019, February 2019, p. 28 (available here ).",

shall take place only if, subject to the other provisions of this Regulation, the conditions laid down in this chapter are complied with by the controller and processor, including for onward transfers of personal data from the third country or an international organisation to another third country or to another international organisation. All provisions in this chapter shall be applied in order to ensure that the level of protection of natural persons guaranteed by this Regulation is not undermined. Under Article 44, GDPR, any transfer of personal data to a third country (or international organisation) shall take place only it respects the GDPR as well as the specific conditions laid down in Chapter V. The same conditions must also be met for onward transfers to further third countries. The same provision specifies that all the provisions in Chapter V must be applied in order to ensure that the protection of individuals guaranteed by the GDPR is not compromised. EDPB Guidelines: on this Article, and the rest of Chapter V, please see Guidelines 05/2021 on the Interplay between the application of Article 3 and the provisions on international transfers as per Chapter V of the GDPR There is no definition of the notion of a personal data transfer to a third country or an international organization in the GDPR. However, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has recently identified three criteria which, when cumulated, indicate that there is such a transfer: (i) a controller or a processor is subject to the GDPR for a given processing operation; (ii) this controller or processor (\u201c exporter \u201d) discloses by transmission, or otherwise makes personal datasubject to this processing, available to another controller, joint controller or processor (\u201c importer \u201d); and, (iii) the importer is in a third country or is an international organisation, irrespective of whether or not this importer is subject to the GDPR regarding the given processing activity, in accordance with Article 3 GDPR . If all of the criteria (as identified by the EDPB) are met, then a \u201c transfer to a third country or to an international organisation \u201d has taken place. Thus, a transfer implies that personal data are sent or made available by a controller or processor (exporter) which, regarding the given processing, is subject to the GDPR (pursuant to Article 3 GDPR ), to a different controller or processor (importer) in a third country, regardless of whether or not this importer is subject to the GDPR in respect of the given processing. As a consequence, \" the controller or processor in a \u2018 transfer \u2019 \u201d situation (according to the criteria described above) needs to comply with the conditions of Chapter V and frame the transfer by using the instruments which aim at protecting personal data after they have been transferred to a third country or an international organisation .\" [ 1 ] Article 44 GDPR refers to transfers to a third country or international organisation, as well as \u201c onward transfers of personal data from the third country or an international organisation to another third country or to another international organisation \u201d. In the same way that the GDPR does not define transfers, onward transfers are not defined either. Nonetheless, the wording of the article does provide some clues as to what constitutes an onward transfer. This appears to be a transfer (as defined above) to another third country or international organisation, which occurs after the personal data has already been transferred to a third country or international organisation (see Recital 101 GDPR). In other words, \u201c an onward transfer refers to a further transfer of personal data after they have been transferred to a data importer outside the EU or EEA \u201d. [ 2 ] Under Article 44 GDPR, the transfer (or the onward transfer) shall only take place \u201csubject to the other provisions of this Regulation\u201d. As a result, data controllers or processors exporting personal data to third countries or international organisations must ensure the GDPR compliance of the overall processing activity. [ 3 ] This clarifies that obligations and conditions outlined in Chapter V do not replace those outlined throughout the GDPR. Instead, they \u201c build on those of the rest of the GDPR \u201d. [ 4 ] Full compliance with the GDPR means ensuring that there is a valid legal basis for processing the personal data, whether that is in the context of Article 6 or 9 GDPR . Similarly, the GDPR principles under Article 5 GDPR must be respected. Additionally, this obligation to comply with the full extent of the GDPR includes the need to give effect to data subject rights found in Chapter III of the GDPR. On that point, it is important to note that Article 13(1)(f) GDPR , Article 14(1)(f) GDPR , Article 15(1)(c) GDPR and Article 15(2) GDPR , make specific reference to transfers of personal data to third countries or international organisations. The transfer shall also comply with the \u201c conditions laid down in Chapter V \u201d. This reiterates the need to ensure compliance with the GDPRas a whole (see requirement above), whilst placing emphasis on the specific conditions spelled out in Chapter V for each distinct transfer mechanism. According to Recital 101, international transfers can only take place if this Chapter is complied with by the controllers and processors concerned. These instruments include the recognition of the existence of an adequate level of protection in the third country or international organisation to which the data is transferred (Article 45) or, in the absence of such adequate level of protection, the implementation of appropriate safeguards (as provided for in Articles 46(1) , (2) and (3) GDPR ) by the exporter (controller or processor). According to Article 49 GDPR , personal data can be transferred to a third country or an international organisation without the existence of an adequate level of protection or the implementation of appropriate safeguards only in specific situations and under certain conditions. [ 5 ] These conditions are outlined in the commentary on Articles 45 to 50 GDPR . The last part of Article 44 GDPR specifies that all the provisions in Chapter V must be applied in order to ensure that the protection of individuals guaranteed by the GDPR is not compromised. The Schrems II judgment clarifies that Chapter V must be \u201c read in light of \u201d the general principles outlined in Article 44. [ 6 ] This means, among other things, that the third country to which the data is transferred must ensure that \u201c a level of protection essentially equivalent \u201d to the GDPR can provide a guarantee that the level of protection under it\u00a0 is not \u201c undermined \u201d. [ 7 ] This provision therefore serves as a catch-all clause which, on the one hand, makes it possible to assess the conformity of specific types of transfer and, on the other, enables the provisions of Chapter V to be interpreted in such a way as to protect the interests of the data subject. Furthermore, since this sentence does not only refer to the actual process of data transfer, but to \" all the conditions of this chapter \", it also includes Article 50 GDPR, and therefore addresses both the European Commission and data protection authorities, requiring them to effectively enforce the GDPR.

A transfer of personal data to a third country or an international organisation may take place where the Commission has decided that the third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within that third country, or the international organisation in question ensures an adequate level of protection. Such a transfer shall not require any specific authorisation. 2.   When assessing the adequacy of the level of protection, the Commission shall, in particular, take account of the following elements: 3.   The Commission, after assessing the adequacy of the level of protection, may decide, by means of implementing act, that a third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within a third country, or an international organisation ensures an adequate level of protection within the meaning of paragraph 2 of this Article. The implementing act shall provide for a mechanism for a periodic review, at least every four years, which shall take into account all relevant developments in the third country or international organisation. The implementing act shall specify its territorial and sectoral application and, where applicable, identify the supervisory authority or authorities referred to in point (b) of paragraph 2 of this Article. The implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2). 4.   The Commission shall, on an ongoing basis, monitor developments in third countries and international organisations that could affect the functioning of decisions adopted pursuant to paragraph 3 of this Article and decisions adopted on the basis of Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC. 5.   The Commission shall, where available information reveals, in particular following the review referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, that a third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within a third country, or an international organisation no longer ensures an adequate level of protection within the meaning of paragraph 2 of this Article, to the extent necessary, repeal, amend or suspend the decision referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article by means of implementing acts without retro-active effect. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2). On duly justified imperative grounds of urgency, the Commission shall adopt immediately applicable implementing acts in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 93(3). 6.   The Commission shall enter into consultations with the third country or international organisation with a view to remedying the situation giving rise to the decision made pursuant to paragraph 5. 7.   A decision pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article is without prejudice to transfers of personal data to the third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within that third country, or the international organisation in question pursuant to Articles 46 to 49. 8.   The Commission shall publish in the Official Journal of the European Union and on its website a list of the third countries, territories and specified sectors within a third country and international organisations for which it has decided that an adequate level of protection is or is no longer ensured. 9.   Decisions adopted by the Commission on the basis of Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC shall remain in force until amended, replaced or repealed by a Commission Decision adopted in accordance with paragraph 3 or 5 of this Article. Article 45 GDPR refers to the complex issue of international data transfers. The huge amounts of data transferred from the EU to third countries created the necessity to adopt provisions that could ensure the implementation of precautionary measures to protect the transfers. The level of protection that should be achieved is promoted and delimited in Chapter V of the GDPR. Chapter V of the GDPR creates a three-tiered structure for legal bases for international data transfers, with adequacy decisions being at the top, appropriate safeguards in the middle, and negotiations at the bottom. [ 1 ] On the basis of Art. 45 GDPR, the European Commission (Commission) has the power to determine whether a country outside the EU offers an adequate, \" essentially equivalent \" level of data protection than the EU. Adequacy means that the rules implemented in the third countries or international organisations are effective in practice. [ 2 ] The Commission has so far recognised the following countries as providing adequate protection by means of ' adequacy decisions ': Andorra, Argentina, Canada (only commercial organisations), Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Israel, Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Switzerland, the United Kingdom (under the GDPR and the LED) and Uruguay. These decisions entail that personal data can be transferred from the EU (as well as Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland) to these third countries without additional safeguards, that these transfers will be assimilated to intra-EU transmissions of data. [ 3 ] Under Article 45 GDPR, a transfer of personal data to a third country or an international organisation may take place where the Commission has decided that the third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within that third country, or the international organisation in question, ensures an adequate level of protection. The expression ' adequate level of protection ' means that the recipient,\u00a0 by virtue of its national legislation or international obligations, ensures a level of protection of freedoms and fundamental rights which is 'essentially equivalent' to the one guaranteed in the Union in the light of the Charter. [ 4 ] Although the resources used by a third country may differ from those used in the EU, they must nevertheless prove to be equally effective in practice. [ 5 ] The main consequence of the adequacy decision is that, if it is adopted, the transfer \" shall not require any specific authorisation \". Article 45(2) GDPR sets out a number of criteria that the Commission must take into account while considering the adequacy of a third country or an international organisation. This list is not exhaustive [ 6 ] and includes at least the following elements: In assessing the adequacy of a third country or international organisation, the Commission shall take into account, among others, the rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, relevant legislation and its implemenation, data protection rules and security measures(including rules for the onward transfer of personal data to another third country), case-law, effective and enforceable data subject rights, as well as effective administrative and judicial redress for the data subjects whose personal data are being transferred. These criteria assume a minimum level of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Third countries or international organisations must ensure minimum of interference with fundamental rights by providing guarantees for law enforcement and national security access to data. On this topic, the Article 29 Working Party (WP29) has also identified four essential guarantees: (i) processing should be based on clear, precise and accessible rules (legal basis); (ii) necessity and proportionality with regards to legitimate objectives pursued need to be demonstrated; (iii) the processing has to be subject to independent oversight; and (iv) effective remedies need to be available to the individuals. Although these were actually originated from the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in the field of surveillance, the WP29 considers that these four guarantees also apply and need to be respected by all third countries for access to data for national security or law enforcement purposes, in order to be considered adequate. [ 7 ] The Commission will have to ponder the existence and effective functioning of one or more independent DPAs in the third country, including adequate enforcement powers. The independent and effective DPAs shall be mandated to monitor the respect of the third-country or intra-organisational data protection rules. The authorities should also advise data subjects and cooperate with the DPAs of the Member States. [ 8 ] Finally, the international commitments the third country or international organisation concerned has entered into should be taken into consideration, in particular those related to the protection of personal data. This criterion is intended to verify that the international commitments in question do not conflict with the criteria listed above. On the other hand, the presence of international agreements that promote or facilitate the implementation of a more efficient personal data protection system must be positively taken into account. [ 9 ] The criteria listed above are intended as a guide and should not be understood in an overly restrictive sense. This means that the third country does not have to implement the identical measures of protection provided by the EU in order for their data protection system to be deemed adequate.The fundamental different ideas on the protection of personal data among the different states, in combination with the economic policy and entrepreneurial freedoms promoted by the EU, leave space for adaptation for the third countries. It must also be noted that, an adequacy decision cannot regulate the exchange of data for the purpose of national security or the common foreign and security policy. [ 10 ] That said, certain elements of the European order must always be respected. In particular, from a substantive perspective, a third country or international organisation\u2019s system must contain at least the following basic content: (i) rules on basic data protection concepts and/or principles should exist; (ii) grounds for lawful and fair processing for legitimate purposes should be set in a sufficiently clear manner; (iii) the principle of purpose limitation; (iv) data quality and proportionality; (v) data retention; (vi) security and confidentiality; (vii) transparency should be recognized; (viii) the data subject should have at least the right of access, rectification, erasure and objection; and (ix) restrictions on onward transfers are foreseen. The necessary guarantees are not limited to those of a substantial nature. Indeed, the European authorities have clarified that an adequate level of protection cannot be guaranteed without at least the following elements: (i) the presence of at least one independent, impartial, properly funded DPA with investigative powers; (ii) the existence of a data protection system that is shared and known by controllers and data subjects; (iii) an accountability system for controllers; and, finally, (iv) the existence of effective administrative and judicial redress, including compensation for damages as a result of the unlawful processing of\u00a0 personal data Article 45 GDPR refers to the complex issue of\ninternational data transfers. The huge amounts of data transferred from the EU\nto third countries created the necessity to adopt provisions that could ensure\nthe implementation of precautionary measures to protect the transfers. The\nlevel of protection that should be achieved is promoted and delimited in\nChapter V of the GDPR. Chapter V of the GDPR creates a three-tiered structure\nfor legal bases for international data transfers, with adequacy decisions being\nat the top, appropriate safeguards in the middle, and negotiations at the\nbottom. . [ 11 ] Although the CJEU judgement C-311/18 (Schrems II) invalidated the Commission Decision 2016/1250 (EU-US Privacy Shield), but affirmed the validity of standard contractual clauses (SCCs), providing that they include effective mechanisms to ensure compliance in practice with the \u201c essentially equivalent \u201d level of protection guaranteed by the GDPR to EU citizens. Below is the summarised version of this judgement. Maximillian Schrems, an Austrian citizen, had been a Facebook user since 2008. As is the case with users residing in the European Union, some of the data belonging to Mr. Schrems had been transferred by Facebook Ireland to its servers belonging to Facebook Inc., located in the United States. In 2013, Mr. Schrems complained to the Irish Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) seeking to prohibit these transfers. When this complaint was rejected, he brought an action against the decision before the Irish High Court, which in turn referred a number of questions to the CJEU, the most prominent of which was whether the EU-US adequacy decision, the so-called \u201cSafe Harbor\", was valid. In its judgment on October 6 th 2015 (Case C-362/14, \u201cSchrems I\u201d), the CJEU invalidated the Safe Harbor and stated that, in order to be \"adequate\", the level of data protection offered by the third country should be \u201cessentially equivalent\u201d to that being offered in the EU. As a result, the High Court annulled the decision rejecting Mr. Schrems\u2019 complaint, and referred the case back to the DPC. In the remittal \u201cjudgment\u201d before the DPC, Facebook Ireland explained that the invalidated adequacy decision was not relevant as a large part of personal data was transferred to Facebook Inc. pursuant to Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). On this basis, the DPC asked Mr. Schrems to reformulate his complaint. In his reformulated complaint lodged on December 1 st 2015, Mr. Schrems alleged that US law required Facebook Inc. to disclose his personal data to certain United States authorities in the context of various monitoring programs (in particular, the FISA 702 and the Executive Order 12.333). In Mr Schrems\u2019 view, these programs contravened different data protection principles as well as Articles 7, 8, and 47 of the Charter. After investigating the allegations made by Mr. Schrems, the DPC argued that it could not adjudicate on them until the CJEU had examined the validity of the SCCs, and so it brought proceedings before the High Court. On May 4 th 2018 the High Court made the reference for a (second) preliminary ruling to the CJEU. In its reference to the CJEU, the High Court specified that Section 702 of the FISA permitted the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence to authorize jointly, following FISA approval, the surveillance of individuals who are not US citizens and who are located outside of the US in order to obtain foreign intelligence information. It was also affirmed that Section 702 of the FISA provided the basis for the PRISM and UPSTREAM surveillance programs. PRISM in particular, requires Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to supply the NSA with all communications to and from a \u2018selector\u2019. UPSTREAM on the other hand, permitted the NSA to copy and filter Internet traffic flows from the \u2018backbone\u2019 of the internet, granting it access to both the content of communications and their metadata. Furthermore, the High Court had found that Executive Order 12.333 (E.O. 12333) allowed the NSA to access data in transit by accessing underwater cables on the floor of the Atlantic. The High Court stated that the only limit on US surveillance activities was found in the Presidential Policy Directive (PPD-28), and even this only stated that intelligence activities should be \u2018tailored as feasible\u2019. On the basis of these findings, the High Court considered that the US carried out mass processing of personal data without ensuring a level of protection that was essentially equivalent to that which was guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter. The High Court also highlighted that EU citizens did not have the same remedies available to them as US citizens with regards to the processing of their personal data, since the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States did not apply to non-US citizens. This meant that it was particularly difficult for EU citizens to establish standing before a US court. Moreover, activities based on E.O. 12333 were not subject to judicial oversight and were not justiciable. Given the considerable effects of US surveillance law on the rights of Europeans, the High Court raised the question of whether the SCCs are valid, given that they may not be binding on the State authority of the third country. If they did not bind the third country State authority, then they are not capable of remedying a possible lack of an adequate level of protection of personal data. The Court began by clarifying that the GDPR applies to the transfer of personal data for commercial purposes by an economic operator established in a Member State, to another economic operator established in a third country, even if in that country the data would be processed by the national authorities for public security, defense, and state security purposes. Regarding the level of protection required in such an instance, the Court held that the requirements presented by the GDPR regarding safeguards, enforceable rights, and legal remedies must continue to be applied. In other words, when their data is transferred abroad, a data subject must be afforded a level of protection essentially equivalent to that which they would receive in EU. In such circumstances, in order to assess the level of protection, both existing contractual clauses between the data importer and exporter, and the potential access by public authorities in a third country must be taken into account, along with the relevant aspects of the legal system in the third country. The Court then analyzed Decision 2016/1250 (the \u201cPrivacy Shield\u201d), which was the self-certification scheme in place for controllers based in the US. Examining the decision in light of the provisions of the Charter, the Court held that the requirements of US national security, public interest, and law enforcement do in fact interfere with the fundamental rights of persons whose data is transferred there. These limitations on the protection of personal data were not circumscribed in a way that satisfied requirements that are essentially equivalent to those required under EU law. The principle of proportionality was also not satisfied, in so far as US surveillance programs are not limited to what is \u2018strictly necessary\u2019. It was noted that the provisions in the US surveillance programs neither limited the power they conferred onto national authorities, nor granted data subjects actionable rights before the courts against the US authorities. The Court proceeded to scrutinize the Ombudsperson mechanism that had been in place under the Privacy Shield, stating that it too did not provide data subjects with a cause of action before a body which was fully independent, and that this body was limited in so far as it could not impose rules that were binding on US intelligence services. Taking all of this into account, the Court declared the Privacy Shield Decision to therefore be invalid. The Court also clarified that in the absence of an adequacy decision, the competent supervisory authorities are required to suspend or prohibit a transfer of personal data to a third country where they consider that the standard data protection clauses are not or cannot be complied with in the third country, and that the protection of the data transferred cannot be ensured by other means. Following this, the Court then examined the validity of the SCCs (Decision 2010/87). First, the Court held that the validity of the Decision was not called into question by the mere fact that the SCCs do not bind national authorities in a third country. After establishing this, the Court emphasized that the validity of the SCCs, however, did depend on whether there were effective mechanisms in place that make it possible to ensure compliance with the level of protection required by EU law. Important to note is that here the Court held that the SCCs in themselves did provide for such mechanisms. However, it went on to stress that where these mechanisms cannot be complied with, the transfers of personal data pursuant to these clauses is to be suspended or prohibited. Furthermore, there is an obligation on the data exporter and the recipient of the data to verify prior to a transfer, what the level of protection in a third country is, and whether it will be possible to comply with the requirements of the SCCs. According to Article 45(3) GDPR, after assessing the adequacy of the level of protection of a third country [ 12 ] under paragraph 2, the Commission may decide to adopt an adequacy decision by means of an implementing act. The implementing act shall specify its territorial and sectoral application and, where applicable, identify the DPAor authorities referred to in point (b) of paragraph 2 of this provision. The implementing act shall also provide for a mechanism for a periodic review, which should be carried out at least every four years,\u00a0 taking into account all relevant developments in the third country or international organisation. [ 13 ] The implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2) GDPR . The process in order to adopt an adequacy decision requires the submission of a proposal from the Commission, a non-binding opinion from the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), an approval from representatives of EU countries, and finally, the adoption of the decision by the Commission. The significance of the decision is easily understood due to its effect. After the adoption of a decision, personal data can flow from the EEA to a third country without the requirement of further safeguards. [ 14 ] The Commission can issue adequacy decisions for any country that is not an EU Member State or party to the EEA, a territory or one or more specified sectors within one of these countries, as well as an international organisation, as this provision establishes. As mentioned beforehand, so far, the Commission has issued adequacy decisions for the following countries: Andorra, Argentina, Canada (only commercial organisations), the Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Israel, the Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand, Republic of Korea , Switzerland, United Kingdom (under the GDPR and the LED) and Uruguay. [ 15 ] Under Article 45(4) GDPR, following the adoption of an adequacy decision, the Commission must regularly examine whether the functioning of an adequacy decision is still correct, both objectively and legally. In any event, such an examination is necessary where there are indications which give rise to doubts in that regard.\u00a0 This continuous adequacy monitoring also requires dialogue with the authorities of the third country concerned. The Commission may also continue to do so with the support of the EDPB in accordance with Article 70(1)(b) GDPR. [ 16 ] According to Article 45(5) GDPR, the continued monitoring referred to in paragraph 3, or other information which has come to light, may demonstrate that the third country does not ensure the essentially equivalent level of protection referred to in paragraph 2, and that the initial adequacy decision is therefore no longer accurate. In such circumstances, the Commission is required, to the extent necessary, to repeal, amend, or suspend the initial decision by means of implementing acts without retro-active effects. [ 17 ] The decision-making procedure referred to in Article 93(2) GDPR shall apply unless there are urgency elements requiring an immediate decision. In that case, the procedure provided for in Article 93(3) GDPR shall apply. This allows the Commission to react on short notice, where appropriate, to changes in circumstances within the third country or the international organisation, and to amend the adequacy decision. Whether there is a duly justified case must be decided on a case-by-case basis. [ 18 ] Article 45(6) GDPR establishes that following the repeal, amendment or suspension decision under paragraph 5, the Commission has to enter into consultations with the third country or the international organisation in order to remedy the situation. [ 19 ] The aim of the negotiations with the Commission is to encourage the third country or international organisation to raise the level of protection of personal data again and to bring it closer to European standards. Article 45(7) GDPR clarifies that in case the Commission withdraws a previous decision or, in more limited terms, suspends or amends it, transfers can nevertheless take place according to the other instruments provided for in Articles 46-49 of the GDPR (e.g. SCCs or binding corporate rules). The provision expresses a general principle, and applies not only to the case provided for in paragraph 5, but also in cases where an adequacy decision has not been previously adopted. According to Article 45(8) GDPR, the Commission's adequacy decision for third countries, their territories and specific sectors, as well as for international organisations, \u00a0must be published in the Official Journal of the European Union, as well as on the Commission's website. [ 20 ] Article 45(9) GDPR establishes that decisions adopted by the Commission on the basis of Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC shall remain in force until amended, replaced or repealed by a Commission Decision adopted in accordance with paragraph 3 or 5 of this provision. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 45 GDPR \u2191 Kuner , in Kuner, Bygrave, Docksey, The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): A Commentary, Article 45 GDPR, p. 774 (Oxford University Press 2020). \u2191 WP29, \u2018Adequacy Referential\u2019, 18/EN WP 254 rev.01, 6 February 2018, p. 3 (available here ). \u2191 The\u00a0 adequacy decisions which are currently adopted can be found here . \u2191 CJEU, Case C-311/18, Facebook Ireland and Schrems , 16 July 2020, margin number 94 (available here ).

In the absence of a decision pursuant to Article 45(3), a controller or processor may transfer personal data to a third country or an international organisation only if the controller or processor has provided appropriate safeguards, and on condition that enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects are available. 2.   The appropriate safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 may be provided for, without requiring any specific authorisation from a supervisory authority, by: 3.   Subject to the authorisation from the competent supervisory authority, the appropriate safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 may also be provided for, in particular, by: 4.   The supervisory authority shall apply the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63 in the cases referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article. 5.   Authorisations by a Member State or supervisory authority on the basis of Article 26(2) of Directive 95/46/EC shall remain valid until amended, replaced or repealed, if necessary, by that supervisory authority. Decisions adopted by the Commission on the basis of Article 26(4) of Directive 95/46/EC shall remain in force until amended, replaced or repealed, if necessary, by a Commission Decision adopted in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article. Article 46(1) allows the transfer of personal data to a third country or an international organisation in the absence of an adequacy decision and always ' on condition that enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects are available '. This provision, together with the others contained in Chapter V, thus contributes to the transfer of personal data in a globalised economy while ensuring a level of protection comparable to that provided by European law. From a practical point of view, the instruments regulated by Article 46 are very important, since the vast majority of third countries or international organisations do not have their own adequacy decision under Article 45 GDPR . Therefore, in the absence of such instruments, data transfer would be precluded to a large part of the planet. Article 46(1) allows the transfer of personal data to a third country or an international organisation in the absence of an adequacy decision, by means of appropriate safeguards. Although the provision seems to limit its scope to cases where there is no adequacy decision, it should be pointed out that the safeguards mentioned in the provision constitute an alternative system of data transfer and can therefore be additional elements to the adequacy decision. For example, there may be cases where the controller, for a variety of reasons, may consider that the adequacy decision is invalid, or does not provide an essentially equivalent level of protection. In such circumstances, it would not make sense to inhibit the controller from using these additional tools to increase the protection of data subject rights. [ 1 ] According to Recital 108, appropriate safeguards may consist of making use of binding corporate rules, standard data protection clauses (also known as standard contractual clauses or SCCs) adopted by the European Commission (Commission), standard data protection clauses adopted by a data protection authority (DPA) or contractual clauses authorised by a DPA. Those safeguards should ensure compliance with data protection requirements and the rights of the data subjects appropriate to processing within the Union.This includes the availability of enforceable data subject rights and of effective legal remedies, the possibility to obtain effective administrative or judicial redress, as well as to claim compensation, in the Union or in a third country. Paragraph 1 clarifies that a transfer on the basis of appropriate safeguards may only take place if enforceable rights are granted to the data subject. This includes, in particular, the right of access ( Article 15 GDPR ), rectification ( Article 16 GDPR ), deletion ( Article 17 GDPR ), restriction of processing ( Article 18 GDPR ), objection ( Article 21 GDPR ) and the right to \u2018 claim damages \u2019 in the EU or in a third country. However, the mere granting of substantive rights is of little use to the data subject; in order to enforce them, the data subject must also have effective remedies at their disposal. The absence of an adequacy decision entails that there are no legal provisions on which the data subject can rely on if they wish to enforce their rights. Therefore, a different legal avenue is required. This can only be based on a voluntary commitment of the data processing body in the third country, which can be expressed in a construction such as a civil law contract for the benefit of third parties, which in this case would be the data subjects. A further condition for the application of the safeguards in question is that the data subject must have effective legal remedies against possible infringements in the third country. This requirement clearly consists in the possibility of taking legal action in the third country. The practical feasibility of this requirement is however controversial. In many cases, the ordinary consumer will be faced with complex legal wrangling in distant and unfamiliar legal systems, including potential costs. For these reasons, some have branded this requirement as an \" empty promise \". [ 2 ] In Schrems II , the CJEU held that the notions of appropriate safeguards, enforceable rights, and effective legal remedies under Article 46 GDPR must be interpreted in light of Article 44 GDPR , which states that \u201c all provisions [in Chapter V, including Article 46 GDPR and its SCCs] shall be applied in order to ensure that the level of protection of natural persons guaranteed by [the GDPR] is not undermined \u201d. The Court continued: \u201c that level of protection must therefore be guaranteed irrespective of the provision of that chapter on the basis of which a transfer of personal data to a third country is carried out \u201d. In particular, in the absence of an adequacy decision, and with specific regard to the SCCs, the data exporter should determine whether the laws of the data importer\u2019s country provide an \u201c essentially equivalent \u201d protection of personal data to that guaranteed under EU law. Should that not be the case, \u201c supplementary measures \u201d must be implemented and, if such measures would still not provide an \u201c essentially equivalent \u201d protection, the data transfer must then be suspended. The EDPB has provided specific guidance on the matter. In practice, the data exporter must always check whether the legal situation in the recipient country enables the data importer to comply with the contractual obligations entered into \u2013 for example in the form of standard data protection clauses \u2013 such as those to process the received data exclusively in accordance with the exporter's instructions. [ 3 ] As a consequence, the exporter must verify the state of law and practice in the third country. The analysis should not cover the entire legal system of the third country, but should rather be limited to the most critical areas including law enforcement, intelligence services and specific sectoral disciplines relevant to the specific processing activity. Once the relevant laws have been identified, the third-country law\u2019s compliance with the essential elements of clarity and predictability should then be verified. Finally, an assessment should be made as to whether the law meets the criterion of strict necessity in a democratic society to ensure, among others, state security, national defence or public safety. The mere absence of either of such requirements should lead to the blocking of transfers to the third country unless \u201c additional safeguards \u201d are available to protect the transferred personal data. The EDPB, in its Recommendations 1/2020 paper, mentions mostly encryption and pseudonymisation. However, in some transmission scenarios, it will not be possible to find additional measures that are effective and thus could still \"save\" the transmission. [ 4 ] The CJEU has hereby imposed a considerable burden on data exporters who wish to transfer personal data to any third country. They must actively deal with the legal situation in the third country on an ongoing basis. From this point of view, the Schrems II ruling may indicate a certain trend towards the establishment of EU-based servers and storage space. Article 46(2) GDPR provides a list of appropriate safeguards that the controller or processor may use to transfer data without a prior authorisation from the DPA. The list includes the following transfer instruments (or safeguards): (a) a legally binding and enforceable instruments between public authorities or bodies; (b) binding corporate rules in accordance with Article 47 GDPR ; (c) standard data protection clauses adopted by the Commission; (d) standard data protection clauses adopted by a DPA and subsequently approved by the Commission; (e) an approved code of conduct; or (f) an approved certification mechanism. A \u201c legally binding and enforceable instrument between public authorities or bodies \u201d allows data transfers between such entities. This could include, for example, an international agreement (i.e. a treaty) to share data between an EU-based public authority and one in a third country. [ 5 ] The provision does not clarify what is meant by an instrument. Recital 108, however, reduces the uncertainty by mentioning \u201c administrative arrangements, such as a memorandum of understanding, providing for enforceable and effective rights for data subjects \u201d. EDPB Guidelines : on this provision there are Guidelines 2/2020 on articles 46 (2) (a) and 46 (3) (b) of Regulation 2016/679 for transfers of personal data between EEA and non-EEA public authorities and bodies Binding corporate rules allow the transfer of personal data to third countries without an adequacy decision, when the transfer takes place within the same group of companies. For more on this, please refer to the commentary on Article 47 GDPR . Standard data protection clauses (or SCCs), are a set of predefined clauses prepared by the European Commission and adopted under through a decision under Article 93(2) GDPR . A first set of such clauses were established by decisions 2001/497/EC and 2010/87/EU. [ 6 ] As mentioned above, with the Schrems II decision, the CJEU emphasised that not only adequacy decisions ( Article 45 GDPR ), but also SCCs, must ensure an essentially equivalent level of protection and that it is incumbent on the controller to ensure that additional safeguards are given where the case so requires. Taking this into account, on 4 June 2021 the Commission adopted the Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914, which established a new set of SCCs. These clauses transpose the main aspects of the GDPR as well as the Schrems II ruling into contractual terms. Among other things, by signing the SCCs, the contractual parties are required to, among the others, (i) fully inform the data subjects about the processing and the transfer, (ii) ensure the full exercise of their GDPR rights; (iii) provide an easy point of contact for the data subject to make any complaints or claims; (iv) continuously assess the importer\u2019s national law and verify whether it provides an essentially equivalent level of protection and, should that not be the case, (v) adopt additional measures to solve the problem or otherwise interrupt the transfer. Moreover, (vi) data subjects should be able to be represented in court by non-profit associations, and to claim compensation for damages resulting from unlawful processing operations. Recital 109 GDPR clarifies that there is no prohibition against \" adding other clauses or additional safeguards provided that they do not contradict, directly or indirectly, the standard contractual clauses adopted by the Commission or by a supervisory authority or prejudice the fundamental rights or freedoms of the data subjects \". However, any amendment of the \" standard clauses means that they will be considered to be ad hoc clauses that require the authorisation of the competent DPA \" under Article 46(3)(a) GDPR. Article\n46(1) allows the transfer of personal data to a third country or an\ninternational organisation in the absence of an adequacy decision and always ' on condition that enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects are available '. This provision, together with the others contained in Chapter V, thus contributes to\nthe transfer of personal data in a globalised economy while ensuring a level of\nprotection comparable to that provided by European law. From a practical point\nof view, the instruments regulated by Article 46 are very important, since the\nvast majority of third countries or international organisations do not have\ntheir own adequacy decision under [ 7 ] A further innovation of the GDPR is the possibility for SCCs to be adopted not only by the Commission, but also by the DPAs of the individual Member States. The adoption of such clauses requires, firstly, the mandatory opinion of the EDPB under Article 64(1)(d) GDPR and, subsequently, the acceptance of the Commission under the procedure provided for in Article 93(2) GDPR . Codes of conduct are another novelty brought by the GDPR. They are drawn up by associations (which may represent certain groups of data processors) and provide these bodies with guidelines for the application of the GDPR, for example, with regard to technical and organisational security measures, reporting obligations in the event of data protection violations, as well as data transfers to third countries or to international organisations. For further information, please refer to the commentary on Article 40 GDPR . EDPB Guidelines : For this provision, please see Guidelines 04/2021 on Codes of Conduct as tools for transfers The GDPR does not contain a definition of \" certification mechanism \" although Article 42 GDPR refers to \" data protection seals and marks \". An example of a certification mechanism would thus \" presumably be a trustmark placed on a website, which would have to be backed up by some sort of code of conduct or code of practice \". Certification mechanisms are voluntary, but under Article 42(5) GDPR they may be approved either by a DPA or a national certification body as set out in Article 43 GDPR . A certification mechanism must contain \" binding and enforceable commitments of the controller or processor in the third country to apply the appropriate safeguards \", and must thus be legally binding. No additional DPA authorisation is required for the use of a certification mechanism once it has been approved. [ 8 ] EDPB Guidelines : on this provision, please see Guidelines 07/2022 on certification as a tool for transfers In addition to the appropriate safeguards provided for in paragraph 2, paragraph 3 opens to further hypotheses. In this case, though, the use of such safeguards require the SA's prior authorisation. The provision mentions two examples, [ 9 ] (a) contractual clauses between the controller or processor and the controller, processor or the recipient (\" Ad-hoc Contractual Clauses \") and (b) provisions to be inserted into administrative arrangements between public authorities (\" Administrative Arrangements \"). Article 46(3)(a) GDPR allows the creation of specific transfer agreements between exporter and importer. It is clear that the contract should clarify the essential aspects of the transfer and follow the SCC\u2019s structure in terms of content and safeguards. For example, clauses defining the intended purpose, the categories of data to be transmitted or the measures to prevent unauthorized access. In contrast to the subsequent Article 46(3)(b), this provision does not provide that the clauses must include \" enforceable and effective data subject rights \". This is evidently a drafting error since it is precisely in such cases that there is a need to protect the interests of the data subject. Consequently, the ad-hoc clauses should also contain provisions on such safeguards. Article 46(3)(b) GDPR permits transfers based on \" provisions to be inserted into administrative arrangements between public authorities or bodies \". Unlike the agreements referred to in Article 46(2)(a) above, these agreements are not \" legally binding \" (Recital 108 speaks of \" memorandum of understandings \"), which is why they require prior authorisation by the DPA. Kuner correctly points out that it is unclear \" how 'enforceable and effective' rights for data subjects can be provided when the arrangements under which such rights are to be secured are themselves not legally binding \". [ 10 ] EDPB Guidelines : on this provision there are Guidelines 2/2020 on articles 46 (2) (a) and 46 (3) (b) of Regulation 2016/679 for transfers of personal data between EEA and non-EEA public authorities and bodies The appropriate safeguards under paragraph 3 must be submitted to the respective DPAfor examination and approval. The supervisory authorities must not only provide an express answer, but also needs to be proactive and assess the effectiveness of the proposed safeguards. The DPA shall also apply the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63 GDPR . Authorisations by a Member State or a DPAon the basis of Article 26(2) DPD shall remain valid until amended, replaced or repealed, if necessary, by that DPA. Similarly, decisions adopted by the Commission on the basis of Article 26(4) DPD shall remain in force until amended, replaced or repealed, if necessary, by a Commission Decision adopted in accordance with paragraph 2 of the aforementioned DPD provision. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 46 GDPR \u2191 Schantz , in Simitis, Hornung, Spiecker gen.

Decisions 5 References 1.   The competent supervisory authority shall approve binding corporate rules in accordance with the consistency mechanism set out in Article 63, provided that they: 2.   The binding corporate rules referred to in paragraph 1 shall specify at least: 3.   The Commission may specify the format and procedures for the exchange of information between controllers, processors and supervisory authorities for binding corporate rules within the meaning of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure set out in Article 93(2). In order to compensate for a lack of data protection in a third country that has not been declared as safe under Article 45 GDPR , entities can adopt binding corporate rules (BCR) pursuant to Articles 46(2)(b) and 47 GDPR. They constitute an appropriate safeguard for international data transfers. BCRs is one of the appropriate safeguards which can be used, in the absence of an adequacy decision, to transfer personal data outside of the EU. Article 4(20) GDPR defines them as \"personal data protection policies \u201d which are adhered to by a controller or processor established in the EU, \u201c for transfers or a set of transfers of personal data to a controller or processor in one or more third countries within a group of undertakings, or group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity \". While it did not specifically deal with BCRs, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) C-311/18 judgement (Schrems II) held that the use of appropriate safeguards requires that they provide a level of protection that is \u201cessentially equivalent to that under EU data protection law based on the Charter. The EDPB has found that this standard applies to all the types of appropriate safeguards in Article 46(2) that are of a contractual nature, which includes BCRs.\u201d In other words, this implies that \u201c the Schrems II judgment is also relevant to BCRs, and that BCRs may require the use of supplementary transfer tools just as the standard contractual clauses do. \" [ 1 ] They refer specifically to the third-country transfers within one group of undertakings or group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity. Therefore, BCRs cannot be used as a justification for international data transfers to entities that are not part of the relevant group of undertakings or group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity. Moreover, \" group entities must bear in mind that BCR will only prove an adequate level of data protection within the group but cannot serve as legal basis for processing. Thus, the group entities must ensure that such legal basis is fulfilled .\" [ 2 ] An \" enterprise \u201d is defined in Article 4(18) GDPR as \u201c a natural or legal person engaged in an economic activity, irrespective of its legal form, including partnerships or associations regularly engaged in an economic activity \u201d. \u201c A group of undertakings \u201d, following Article 4(19) GDPR , is constituted by \u201c a controlling undertaking and its controlled undertakings \u201d. The GDPR, however, does not define what a \u201c a group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity \u201d is. According to Kuner, this could be a joint venture or an alliance, \u201c as long as it is stable \u201d. [ 3 ] BCRs may be introduced for either data controllers, data processors, or in a mixed form. [ 4 ] Article 47(1) GDPR establishes the following requirements for BCRs: (i) they are legally binding, apply to and are enforced by every member of the group, including the employees (Article 47(1)(a) GDPR); (ii) expressly confer enforceable rights on data subjects with regard to the processing of their personal data (47(l)(b) GDPR; and (iii) fulfil the requirements laid down in Article 47(2) GDPR. The BCRs must contain a clear duty for all the members of the group and for its employees to respect the BCRs. The group will have to explain, in its application form, how the rules are made binding between the companies/entities in the group by, say, intra-group agreements, unilateral undertakings, internal regulatory measures, policies, or other means. The same shall be done with regard to employees by one or more individual and separate agreement/undertaking with sanctions, a clause in the employment contract with sanctions, internal policies with sanctions, or collective agreements with sanctions. [ 5 ] The BCRs must grant rights to data subjects to enforce the rules as third-party beneficiaries. The rights should cover the judicial remedies for any breach of the rights guaranteed and the right to receive compensation. The BCRs must contain a duty for the EU headquarters, or the EU BCR member with delegated responsibilities, to accept responsibility for the acts of other members linked by the BCRs outside of the EU, to take the necessary action to remedy them, as well as to pay compensation for any damages resulting from the violation of the BCRs by its members. The BCRs must also state that, if a member of the group outside the EU violates them, the courts or other competent authorities in the EU will have jurisdiction, and the data subject will have the rights and remedies against the member that has accepted liability, as if the violation had taken place by them in the Member State in which they are based, instead of the country outside the EU where the member is based. [ 6 ] See paragraph 2 below. Article 47(2) GDPR non-exhaustively lists what should be included in the BCRs. The Article 29 Working Party (WP29) has also introduced specific guidelines for controllers and for processors on this matter. BCRs may include, amongst others: the group\u2019s structure and contact details, the material scope and a general description of the transfers, so as to allow the data protection authorities (DPAs) to assess that the processing carried out in third countries is GDPR compliant (Articles 47(2)(a) and 47(2)(b) GDPR); explanation of how the rules are made binding and enforced among its members and employees (Article 47(1)(a)and 47(2)(c) GDPR); conferral of rights on data subjects to enforce the rules as third-party beneficiaries, including at least data protection principles, transparency and easy access rules, rights of the data subject, national legislation, right to complain through the company\u2019s internal complaint mechanism, cooperation duties with the DPAs, as well as liability and jurisdiction provisions (Articles 47(1)(b), 47(2)(d), 47(2)(e), 47(2)(g), 47(2)(i), 47(2)(l) GDPR); a duty for the EU BCR member to accept responsibility for the acts of other members outside of the EU, to take the necessary action to remedy them, as well as to pay compensation for any damages resulting from the violation of the BCRs by its members, and to pay compensation for any material or non-material damages resulting from the violation of the BCRs by them (Article 47(2)(f) GDPR); commitment that a training on the BCRs will be provided to personnel that have permanent or regular access to personal data (Article 47(2)(n) GDPR; a duty for the group to have data protection audits on regular basis (Article 47(2)(j) GDPR); and to designate where required a DPO (Article 47(2)(h) GDPR). [ 7 ] The format and procedures for the exchange of information about BCRs between the controllers, processors and DPAs shall be specified by the Commission, in accordance with Article 93(2) GDPR . Additionally, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) may issue relevant guidelines and opinions. The EDPB has so far endorsed five WP29 papers relating to BCRs. [ 8 ] BCRs are approved by the national DPAs rules in accordance with the consistency mechanism set out in Article 63 GDPR . Following provisions of Article 64(f) GDPR , the EDPB issues a non-binding opinion whenever the DPA aims to approve the BCRs. [ 9 ] The group interested in introducing the BCRs should propose the DPA to act as \u201c the BCR Lead \u201d. In its application, the group should include all relevant information about a nature and general structure of the processing activities. The WP29 proposed the following informal criteria to take into account when defining the appropriate DPA: the location(s) of the group\u2019s European headquarters; the location of the company within the group with delegated data protection responsibilities; the location of the company which is best placed (in terms of management function, administrative burden, etc.) to deal with the application and enforcement of the binding corporate rules in the Group; the place where most decisions in terms of the purposes and the means of the processing (i.e. transfer) are taken; and the Member State within the EU from which most or all transfers outside the EEA will take place. The DPA that receives the application must inform other DPAs concerned about its decision to become the BCR Lead. If it agrees to does so, then the other DPAs have, under Article 57(1)(g) GDPR , a right to raise any objections within two weeks (period extendable to two additional weeks if requested by any DPAs concerned). If the DPA refuses to act as the BCR Lead, it should explain the reasons for its decision, as well as its recommendations (if any) as to which other DPA would be appropriate. Once a decision on the BCR Lead has been made, the corresponding DPA starts to communicate with the applicant, and reviews the draft BCR documents. Other DPAs concerned may act as co-reviewers of the documents. After the review process, the applicant sends \u201c a consolidated draft \u201d to the BCR Lead , which may be commented by other DPAs concerned. The BCR Lead the submits, following Article 64(1) GDPR and Article 64(4) GDPR , a draft decision to the EDPB. The EDPB, in turn, issues a non-binding opinion on the BCRs. If the opinion endorses the draft decision, the BCR Lead adopts the decision approving the BCRs. If the opinion requires any amendment to the draft BCRs, the BCR Lead, acting under Article 64(7) GDPR , communicates to the Chair of the EDPB, within two-weeks, whether it intends to maintain its draft decision, or it intends to amend it in accordance with the EDPB opinion. If the BCR Lead refuses to include the EDPB amendments in the draft decision, then dispute resolution under Article 65(1) GDPR is triggered. If, on the other hand, the BCR Lead decides to follow the EDPB opinion, it then contacts the applicant immediately in order to request the corresponding amendments to the draft. When the draft BCRs have been finalized in accordance with the EDPB opinion, the BCR Lead amends its initial draft decision, approves the BCRs, and notifies the EDPB. After the approval, the BCR Lead informs all other DPAs concerned about its decision. The group whose BCRs have not been accepted by the DPA, can challenge this decision under Article 78 GDPR . The EDPB\u2019s opinion may be challenged before the CJEU under the annulment procedure in Article 263 of the TFEU.

Tribunal, or Administrative Authority of a Third Country 3.2 Requiring [...] to Transfer or Disclose Personal Data 3.3 Enforcement Requires International Agreements or Mutual legal Assistance Treaties 3.4 Without Prejudice to other Grounds for Transfer 3.1 Judgment of a Court, Tribunal, or Administrative Authority of a Third Country 3.2 Requiring [...] to Transfer or Disclose Personal Data 3.3 Enforcement Requires International Agreements or Mutual legal Assistance Treaties 3.4 Without Prejudice to other Grounds for Transfer 4 Decisions 5 References Any judgment of a court or tribunal and any decision of an administrative authority of a third country requiring a controller or processor to transfer or disclose personal data may only be recognised or enforceable in any manner if based on an international agreement, such as a mutual legal assistance treaty, in force between the requesting third country and the Union or a Member State, without prejudice to other grounds for transfer pursuant to this Chapter. Whenever personal data processed in the EU are transferred or disclosed in response to a request from a third country authority, such transfer or disclosure is subject to the GDPR and constitutes a transfer in accordance with Chapter V of the GDPR. Accordingly, a legal basis under Article 6 GDPR is needed for the data processing as well as a ground for transfer under Chapter V. [ 1 ] Article 48 GDPR is meant to ensure that a third country cannot make an unilateral decision that leads to the systematic transfer of personal data from the Union to that third country. [ 2 ] While, according to the EDPB, Article 48 GDPR itself is not a ground for a transfer, [ 3 ] it establishes conditions for recognising and enforcing decisions from third-country courts and administrative authorities in the EU. An ex-territorial judicial order to transfer or disclose personal data outside of the EU will not be recognised or enforced unless it is issued on the grounds of a valid international agreement between the relevant third country and the EU or Member State. EDPB Guidelines : For this Article see EDPB, 'Guidelines 02/2024 on Article 48 GDPR\u2019, 2. December 2024 (Version 1)(available here ). Article 48 GDPR relates only to binding orders issued by courts, tribunals or administrative authorities from third countries. Private enforcement, such as arbitral institutions, and orders issued within pre-trial proceedings, do not fall within this category. However, according to the EDPB, it makes no difference if the refusal to comply with the judgement or decision is subject to any adverse legal consequences or not. [ 4 ] It is also not applicable for data processing in the context of an activity outside EU law, or data processing by the Member States within the framework of the common foreign and security policy. [ 5 ] \"Article 48 does not limit the purposes for which data may be requested by the third country authority. Thus, requests from third country authorities issued in different contexts and for different purposes would fall within the scope of the provision e.g. requests from law enforcement or national security authorities, financial regulators or public authorities responsible for approving pharmaceutical products.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 02/2024 on Article 48 GDPR\u2019, 2. December 2024 (Version 1), margin number 13. This provision applies to a situation where a court, tribunal or an administrative authority of a third country requires a controller or a processor to transfer or disclose personal data. The addressees of the decision should be subject to the GDPR or, in cases where they are not established in the EU, act within the material and territorial scope of the GDPR. According to Article 48 GDPR the above mentioned judgements and decisions \" may only be recognised or enforceable in any manner, if based on an international agreement, such as a mutual legal assistance treaty, in force between the requesting third country and the Union or a Member State \". Article 48 GDPR refers to international agreements or mutual legal assistance treaties that expressly cover the transfer of personal data. The conventions should be in force between the requesting third country, and the Union or Member State. An example of such agreements is the Hague Convention, [ 6 ] that allows judicial authorities in one country to obtain evidence located in another for use in judicial proceedings. Another example are transfers based on the EU-US Agreement on the use and transfer of Passenger Name Records. \"Furthermore, this request from a third country authority may only be recognised or made enforceable if it is based on an international agreement, which may give such request the effect of a legal obligation to which the controller is subject and non-compliance would have legal consequences. \" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 02/2024 on Article 48 GDPR\u2019, 2. December 2024 (Version 1), margin number 19. Article 6(1)(c) in conjunction with Article 6(3) GDPR could be an appropriate legal basis if there is an applicable international agreement in place which provides for a legal obligation for the controller to transfer or disclose personal data. However, if the international agreement does not provide for a legal obligation for the controller, other legal bases under Article 6 could be applicable. [ 7 ] It should be noted that Article 48 itself is not a ground for transfer. [ 8 ] It only specifies circumstances under which third-country judgements and decisions cannot be recognised or enforced in the Union. Therefore, a controller or processor must identify a ground for the transfer in Chapter V GDPR (as well as a legal basis under Article 6 GDPR ). [ 9 ] \"Article 48 must be read in conjunction with Article 44, the general principle for transfers introducing the chapter. Article 44 lays down the following conditions for transfers under the GDPR: any transfer is subject to the other relevant provisions of the GDPR and complies with the conditions laid down in Chapter V (the two-step test)\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 02/2024 on Article 48 GDPR\u2019, 2. December 2024 (Version 1), margin number 27. One such ground for a transfer could be a \" legally binding and enforceable instrument between public authorities or bodies \" in accordance with Article 46(2)(a) GDPR. Such an instrument could be international agreement in the sense of Article 48 GDPR. [ 10 ] According to the EDPB, the wording \"without prejudice to other grounds for transfer pursuant to this Chapter\" means that another Article 46(2)(a) GDPR cannot be an applicable ground for a data transfer under Chapter V. Also, if an international agreement provides for a legal basis but does not contain appropriate safeguards, Article 46(2)(a) GDPR is not applicable as a ground for the data transfer. [ 11 ] However, according to another opinion, Article 48 GDPR itself should be considered a ground for transfer under Chapter V GDPR.

In the absence of an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45(3), or of appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46, including binding corporate rules, a transfer or a set of transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation shall take place only on one of the following conditions: Where a transfer could not be based on a provision in Article 45 or 46, including the provisions on binding corporate rules, and none of the derogations for a specific situation referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph is applicable, a transfer to a third country or an international organisation may take place only if the transfer is not repetitive, concerns only a limited number of data subjects, is necessary for the purposes of compelling legitimate interests pursued by the controller which are not overridden by the interests or rights and freedoms of the data subject, and the controller has assessed all the circumstances surrounding the data transfer and has on the basis of that assessment provided suitable safeguards with regard to the protection of personal data. The controller shall inform the supervisory authority of the transfer. The controller shall, in addition to providing the information referred to in Articles 13 and 14, inform the data subject of the transfer and on the compelling legitimate interests pursued. 2.   A transfer pursuant to point (g) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 shall not involve the entirety of the personal data or entire categories of the personal data contained in the register. Where the register is intended for consultation by persons having a legitimate interest, the transfer shall be made only at the request of those persons or if they are to be the recipients. 3.   Points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 and the second subparagraph thereof shall not apply to activities carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their public powers. 4.   The public interest referred to in point (d) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 shall be recognised in Union law or in the law of the Member State to which the controller is subject. 5.   In the absence of an adequacy decision, Union or Member State law may, for important reasons of public interest, expressly set limits to the transfer of specific categories of personal data to a third country or an international organisation. Member States shall notify such provisions to the Commission. 6.   The controller or processor shall document the assessment as well as the suitable safeguards referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article in the records referred to in Article 30. The derogations from Article 49 GDPR are a limited closed list of exceptions that can be applied for international transfers of data to third-countries when no other mechanism of Chapter V can be applied. As explained by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), the mechanism in Chapter V acts as a layer structure with three different levels: first, an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 GDPR shall be used, when it exists; second, appropriate safeguards under Article 46 GDPR , such as binding corporate rules or contractual clauses, shall be used; and third, lacking any of the options mentioned above, derogations from Article 49 GDPR may be used. Additionally, Article 44 GDPR must be also be complied with, meaning that any transfer based on a derogation shall, in any case, meet the conditions contained in the provisions of the GDPR: data protection principles are still applicable, and the transfer must be based on a legal basis. Thus, the level of protection that the GDPR offers to natural persons shall not be undermined, and an adequate level of protection shall still be ensured. [ 1 ] EDPB Guidelines : on this Article, please see Guidelines 2/2018 on the exceptions under Article 49 of Regulation 2016/679 In the absence of an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45(3), or of appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46, including binding corporate rules, a transfer or a set of transfers of personal data to a third country or an in\u00adternational organisation shall take place only on one of the following condition: (a) the data subject has explicitly consented; the transfer is necessary for (b) the conclusion or performance of a contract between the data subject and the controller; (c) the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in the interest of a data subject; (d) important reasons of public interest; (e) exercise or defence of legal claims; (f) protection of the vital interests of the data subject or of other persons; and (g) public register in specific cases. These derogations should be interpreted restrictively; [ 2 ] any transfers based on them shall be occasional and non-repetitive. A necessity test should always be carried out. [ 3 ] According to Article 49(1)(a) GDPR, transfers to third countries can happen when \u201c the data subject has explicitly consented to the proposed transfer, after having been informed of the possible risks of such transfers for the data subject due to the absence of an adequacy decision and appropriate safeguards \u201d. Here, the general conditions for consent apply. However, Article 49(1)(a) GDPR is stricter. First, this consent shall be \u201cspecifically\u201d informed. Before providing their consent, data subjects shall be given detailed information regarding the transfer in order to ensure adequate awareness about the particular risks involved in the specific transfer of their personal data to a country which does not ensure the same level of protection as the GDPR does. Second, it requires an explicit statement from the data subject, given the risk it entails. According to Article 49(1)(b) GDPR, transfers to third countries can take place when the \u201c transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the data subject and the controller or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at the data subject\u2019s request \u201d. The use of this derogation is limited by the two above-mentioned conditionings: a necessity test is needed, and the transfer may only be occasional, as Recital 111 GDPR indicates. Firstly, the transfer needs to be necessary for the performance of such contract. There shall be a substantial connection; general related activities to a contract or activities that may be carried out without such transfer are not included. Additionally, the pre-contractual steps shall be taken at the data subject\u2019s request, meaning that they must be explicitly requested, and not merely offered to them. [ 4 ] Secondly, the transfer shall be occasional. Therefore, transfers that occur regularly, such as transfers derived from a business relationship that generally requires such transfers to take place, are not included. Occasional transfers derived from a particular situation that arises in a business relationship may however be included. In accordance with Article 49(3) GDPR, this derogation cannot apply to activities carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their public powers. [ 5 ] According to Article 49(1)(c) GDPR, transfers to third countries can take place when the transfer is \u201c necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in the interest of the data subject between the controller and another natural or legal person \u201d. Similarly to the derogation from Article 49(1)(b) GDPR, this derogation may only be applied on an occasional basis, and carrying out a necessity test. There shall be a close and substantial link between the transfer and a contract concluded in the data subject\u2019s interest. As in the previous paragraph, in accordance with Article 49(3) GDPR, this derogation cannot apply to activities carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their public powers either. [ 6 ] Under Article 49(1)(d) GDPR, transfers to third countries can take place when the transfer is \u201c necessary for important reasons of public interest \u201d. Only public interests recognized in Union law or in the law of the Member State to which the controller is subject may be taken into account, in accordance with Article 49(4) GDPR. The provision that defines such public interest must not be abstract; the same activity linked to the transfer in both countries must be specifically addressed. Transfers will be allowed, for example, for important public interest recognised in international agreements or conventions signed by both countries. It is the public interest itself which makes the derogation applicable, not the nature of the organization. Therefore, private entities seeking such public interest may also rely on this derogation. The general limitations for derogations previously mentioned \u2013 ie. the transfer is occasional and a necessity test is carried out \u2013 must also be applied. [ 7 ] According to Article 49(1)(e) GDPR, transfers to third countries can take place when the \u201c transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims \u201d. This includes any kind of proceeding \u2013 e.g. criminal, administrative or arbitration proceedings\u2013 and pre-trial discovery procedures, as long as the processing is closely related to the activity, it is made occasionally, and does not refer to a mere possibility, but to a specific proceeding. The only condition regarding the nature of the procedure is that it must have its basis in law. There must be a substantial connection between the transfer and the specific exercise of a particular right, and only the data that is particularly necessary for such exercise shall be transferred. [ 8 ] According to Article 49(1)(f) GDPR, transfers to third countries can take place when the \u201c transfer necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of other persons, where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent \u201d. In this case, what is relevant is the incapacity of the data subject to provide consent. If the data subject is able to consent, even if the data transfer is necessary to protect their vital interest, this derogation shall not be applied, and the derogation from Article 49(1)(a) GDPR will be applicable instead. The incapacity may be physical, mental or legal. Therefore, a case of a medical emergency in which the data subject is unconscious is a good example. The data subject may also be mentally incapable of giving consent, or may not have legal capacity \u2013 e.g. because they are a minor. Such incapability needs to be proved, and the data subject must be facing an imminent risk of serious harm. This derogation may also apply in case of armed conflict, or rescue and retrieval operations. [ 9 ] According to Article 49(1)(g), transfers to third countries can take place when the \u201c transfer is made from a public registry \u201d. Such register must be open to consultation by the public in general, or by anyone who can demonstrate a legitimate interest. Two conditions must be met: firstly, the conditions for consultation set by law must be fulfilled; and secondly, the principles of the GDPR must be applied, meaning that the controller needs to asses if the transfer is appropriate, taking the interests and rights of the data subject into consideration. Once again,\u00a0 the restriction in Article 49(3) GDPR is apposite here, and this derogation cannot apply to activities carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their public powers. [ 10 ] According to the final paragraph in Article 49(1) GDPR, when none of the derogations described above (Article 49(1)(a-g) GDPR) is applicable, transfers to third countries can still take place due to \u201c compelling legitimate interests pursued by the controller \u201d. This derogation shall thus only be used in residual cases, when there is no other option available. The legitimate interest of the controller should, however, not be overridden by the interests and rights of the data subject. The transfer should be essential for the controller\u2019s interests as well as non-repetitive and the controller should also be able to demonstrate all these elements. In such cases, suitable additional safeguards must be provided in order to reduce the transfer\u2019s risk and impact. The controller must inform the data protection authority (DPA) about the transfer and all relevant aspects are duly recorded. Lastly, the controller should inform the data subject about the transfer and its risks. [ 11 ] According to Article 49(5) GDPR, the European Union or Member States can provide in the law for limitations of transfers of specific categories of data to third countries, based on important reasons of public interest. This may only cover specific and limited cases, and must be expressly stated in the legal provision. [ 12 ] The controller or processor shall document the assessment as well as the suitable safeguards referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article in the records referred to in Article 30. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 49 GDPR \u2191 EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 2/2018 on derogations of Article 49 under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 25 May 2018, p. 3 (available here ). \u2191 Kuner , in Kuner, Bygrave, Docksey, The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): A Commentary, Article 49 GDPR, p. 846 (Oxford University Press 2020). \u2191 EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 2/2018 on derogations of Article 49 under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 25 May 2018, p. 4 (available here ). \u2191 Kuner , in Kuner, Bygrave, Docksey, The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): A Commentary, Article 49 GDPR, p. 848 (Oxford University Press 2020). \u2191 EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 2/2018 on derogations of Article 49 under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 25 May 2018, p. 9 (available here ). \u2191 EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 2/2018 on derogations of Article 49 under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 25 May 2018, p. 9 (available here ). \u2191 EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 2/2018 on derogations of Article 49 under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 25 May 2018, pp. 10-11 (available here ). \u2191 EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 2/2018 on derogations of Article 49 under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 25 May 2018, pp. 11-12 (available here ). \u2191 EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 2/2018 on derogations of Article 49 under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 25 May 2018, p. 13 (available here ). \u2191 EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 2/2018 on derogations of Article 49 under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 25 May 2018, p. 14 (available here ). \u2191 EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 2/2018 on derogations of Article 49 under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 25 May 2018, pp. 15-16 (available here ). \u2191 Kuner , in Kuner et al., The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Article 49 GDPR, p. 854 f.

Article 4 GDPR provides a list of definitions used to further specify relevant terms used throughout the GDPR. Some definitions are taken from the preceding Directive 95/46/EC , allowing an understanding to build upon the already existing terms. Other definitions, however, are newly introduced, modified, or complemented with additional elements, and therefore require a new interpretation. The principal concept of the GDPR is that of \u2018 personal data\u2019, as the Regulation only applies to personal data and refers to it throughout the text of the GDPR. Its definition developed from a previously existing definition under Article 2 (a) Directive 95/46/EC . [ 1 ] The Directive itself derives the definition from Article 2 (a) Convention 108 , [ 2 ] according to which \" personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual \". The definition can be divided into the following four requirements: (1) \u2018any information\u2019; (2) \u2018relating to\u2019; (3) \u2018an identified or identifiable\u2019; (4) 'individual'.  The fulfilment of all of these aspects is required in order to satisfy the notion of personal data. With the expression of \u2018any information\u2019, the legislator underlines the willingness to keep the term \u2018personal data\u2019 as broad as possible. In this regard, the German Constitutional Court already in 1983 stated that \" Under the conditions of automatic data processing, there is no longer meaningless data. \" [ 3 ] This position is supported by the Commission, stating that \"any item of data relating to an individual, harmless though it may seem, may be sensitive\" , [ 4 ] thereby also following the wish of the Council to keep the definition as general as possible. [ 5 ] Equally, the European Court of Human Rights stated that \u201cprivate life\u201d must not be interpreted restrictively. In particular, respect for private life comprises the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings [...] there is no reason of principle to justify excluding activities of a professional or business nature from the notion of \u201cprivate life\u201d . [ 6 ] Accordingly, personal data includes any information, no matter if it relates to the individual\u2019s private and family life and information regarding the working, economic or social behaviour of the individual regardless of its position or capacity. [ 7 ] For example: Petra is keeping various information on her smartphone. This includes information that she does not seem to treat as private, as she even shares them online on widely available platforms, with her name attached, but there is also information about her love and sex life in chats, that she clearly feels are very private. In addition she keeps data in relation to her job as an independent contractor on her phone. The GDPR covers all such information - no matter if the information is trivial or extremely sensitive, private or related to her business. The information can either be 'objective' such as unchangeable characteristics of a data subject as well as 'subjective' in the form of opinions or assessments. [ 8 ] It is thereby not necessary for the information to be true, proven or complete. [ 9 ] This means that also mere likeliness, predictions or planning information is covered by the GDPR, as long as it relates to a person. For example: Petra is also customer of a bank with a private and a commercial bank account. The bank does not only hold her name, address, contact data or passport information, but also all her transaction data. In addition the bank also uses a system to predict if Petra may default on her loan. For the prediction the Bank uses information about unpaid bills from a third party provider. The information is actually incorrect, as Petra always paid her bills. All such data is covered by the GDPR, allowing Petra to e.g. use her rights under the GDPR to take action against incorrect information associated with her. With regards to the format or medium of the information, data of any type - may it be alphabetical, numerical, (photo)graphical, acoustic - is included. This includes information on paper as well as information stored on a computer in binary form or on tape, such as video surveillance, [ 10 ] telebanking, [ 11 ] medical prescriptions, [ 12 ] or even child's drawings. [ 13 ] The GDPR deliberately does not specify the medium or types of information, following a 'tech neutral' approach. The information needs to relate to an individual. In accordance with the WP29, [ 14 ] the CJEU assesses this requirement based on three different criteria, i.e. \" where the information, by reason of its content , purpose or effect , is linked to a particular person \". [ 15 ] The content of the information is ' relating to' a person when it is about a particular individual. [ 16 ] On the contrary, information relating to a larger group of people without any possibility to single out a individual is not related to a particular person. [ 17 ] For example: A marketing company's system identifies twenty different groups within the French society. They assign different income levels, spending behaviours, and political views to these groups. This information is not covered by the GDPR. However, once the company assigns Felix's profile to such a group \u2013 claiming that he would be conservative, mid-level income, and open to spending his income on travels \u2013 this information now relates to Felix and is covered by the GDPR. Similarly, information exclusively linked to objects or events may not be considered as related to a particular person. [ 18 ] However, when information on objects also concerns individuals, it can relate to them indirectly. For example, the objective value of a house allows others to infer the owners wealth and income situation while car service records allow conclusions towards their driving behaviour. [ 19 ] Also, Geodata (like GPS data and coordinates) allows others to derive locations and movement patterns of individuals. [ 20 ] Equally, information from satellite images could be used to find out if a person can afford a large property or a swimming pool, provided that the image can be linked to an individual. [ 18 ] This is particularly relevant in the current technological landscape, considering the wealth of information which can be extracted from a growing number of personal devices, wearables and RFID-Chips, especially as these devices become increasingly associated to their owners or users. [ 21 ] For example: A controller uses unique IDs of smart watches, smart phones and connected cars to collect information about the use of these devices. These devices are all used by a single person, so in fact the use of these devices also 'relate[s] to' a natural person. Furthermore, the purpose of the information can determine whether it is 'related to a person', where it is used to change their particular status or behaviour. [ 22 ] Accordingly, data is related to an individual where it is used to determine or influence the way a person is treated or evaluated by the processing entity. [ 23 ] The purpose is therefore closely connected to the effects of the processing of the information. Especially, the impact on a particular person\u2019s rights and interests determines whether information is related to a person or not. [ 24 ] For example, the deployment of a system to determine the position of available taxis would also allow for a monitoring the performance of respective drivers, strongly impacting their employment situation. [ 25 ] The person to which the information relates must also be identified or identifiable. A person is \"identified\" when they can be directly distinguished or \"singled out\" from a larger group of persons, based on the information. [ 26 ] This can be achieved through several 'identifiers' listed by Article 4(1) GDPR , such as the name, identification number, locations, online identifiers, physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of a particular person. Other examples are provided by the Working Party 29 like telephone number, car registration, social security numbers and passport numbers as well as a person\u2019s height, hair colour, clothing or professional qualities. [ 27 ] Note that the name of a person is therefore not necessarily required to identify an individual as there are often more unique identifiers. [ 28 ] For example: A controller holds the phone number of data subjects, but not the names. The users are still 'identified' by that number and the GDPR applies. For example: Example: 'Ursula Schmidt' is such a generic name, that it may not be identified or even identifiable without additional information or context. 'Ursula von der Leyen' may be so specific that it is identifiably the president of the European Commission. A person is \"'identifiable' when they have not been identified yet but where identification is possible through a combination of available pieces of information. [ 29 ] It can be unclear what is still 'identifiable' and what is not anymore. Different people may have different abilities to identify a person, and different contexts or situations may lead to different answers as to the person being identifiable. Recital 26 clarifies that \" to determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used... either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person \". Starting point is therefore an absolute (objective) approach that generally considers both information of the controller as well as information from any other entities to identify a person. However, the 'reasonable likeliness' of such information being used by the controller or a third party, narrows the approach. In this regard, Recital 26 adds that in order \" to ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification... the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments \". In other words, while not all of the information required to identify the person needs to be in the hands of the controller [ 30 ] the mere hypothetical possibility to identify the person with the information from other entities is not sufficient. [ 31 ] Thus, the assessment requires a case-to-case decision on the reasonable likeliness to identify an individual, taking into account the use of state-of-the art tools, available sources, costs, time, and effort requried to identify the individual. The assessment is factual and is not limited to lawful means to identify a person, when it is reasonably likely that an actor could also use unlawful ways to identify a person. In C-582/14 Breyer the CJEU had to consider if IP addresses enable the identification of a natural person. The IP address is the number under which a computer or smartphone can be reached over the internet. Almost every controller exchanging information with a data subject over the internet will have to use the IP addresses. IP addresses can be dynamic (meaning the number is lost every 24 hours or every time a customer restarts their internet modem) or fixed (which means the number is always associated with the same customer). It may be that such a number is associated with a user account, in which case it becomes personal data. Even if the number itself may not be linkable by a controller, governments but also private entities may have legal powers to access subscriber details in relation to the IP-address. The CJEU found that even in such cases, the IP address can constitute personal data. [ 32 ] \"[A] dynamic IP address registered by an online media services provider when a person accesses a website that the provider makes accessible to the public constitutes personal data [...] in relation to that provider, where the latter has the legal means which enable it to identify the data subject with additional data which the internet service provider has about that person.\" CJEU - C-582/14 - Breyer , margin number 49. This example from case law shows that many data types may constitute personal data in one situation and not in another situation. Usually controllers and processors cannot, for example, determine if an IP address in their log files is dynamic or fixed. In practice this may mean that controllers or processors choose to treat all IP addresses as if they are personal data, to ensure compliance with the GDPR. Furthermore, taking the increasing accessibility of information through means such as big data technologies and device fingerprinting into consideration, measures to successfully identify individuals are becoming increasingly effective. [ 33 ] Additionally, because more information is continuously added to individual data sets and stored over a longer period of time, persons are significantly more likely to be identified. [ 34 ] The right to data protection is not restricted to certain nationals or citizens of specific countries [ 35 ] but granted to all natural persons according to Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (\" Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her \"). [ 36 ] For example: third country immigrant entered the EU illegally. Once she arrives she makes a WhatsApp call to inform her family back home that she is safe and is now in the EU. Given that the geographic application of Article 2 GDPR is now triggered, WhatsApp has to grant her all rights under the GDPR - independent of her immigration status or citizenship. This is because the GDPR follows a human rights approach. Starting from this definition, national legislators usually limit it from to moment of birth to the death of a person. [ 37 ] Following up with the GDPR, information relating to deceased persons is then not considered personal data. [ 38 ] However, member states may provide alternative rules for the protection of deceased persons [ 39 ] which is usually achieved through further data protection, constitutional, or personality rights. Another exception can apply for genetic data, where data of deceased persons may be indirectly protected through their relatives. [ 40 ] For more information, see also the commentary on Article 4(13) GDPR . For example: The health records of a deceased patient are not protected by the GDPR. However, most EU Member States have various rules relating the the use of health data or civil law provisions in relation to the right to privacy that may still cover information of deceased persons. As the definition is limited to natural persons, information on legal persons is also generally not covered by the definition of personal data. [ 41 ] However, related provisions from the ePrivacy-Directive, [ 42 ] national data protection laws, or constitutional laws sometimes grant alternative protection. [ 43 ] Furthermore, information regarding legal persons is also protected by the GDPR where it equals information on natural persons. This is particularly relevant where the information on a legal person allows one to derive information on a natural person. For example, a company name or mail address may be related to a natural person and therefore constitute personal data. This is especially common for smaller, family run, or one person businesses/enterprises. [ 44 ] For example: 'Marta O'Connel's Plumbing of Limerick Ltd.' is a limited company and not directly considered a 'natural person' under the GDPR. However, the sole owner and manager is Marta O'Connel and there is also no other female plumber in the whole province of Limerick. Therefore, it is easy to identify the natural person behind the legal entity. Information about 'Marta O'Connel's Plumbing Ltd.' going bankrupt therefore clearly also relates to an identifiable natural person and is, as such, covered by the GDPR. Personal data is often contrasted with 'anonymous' data. Anonymous data is data relating to a person that is not identifiable. The GDPR does not protect such data and controllers or processors are free to use such data (unless there are limits under other applicable law). For example: Employees can participate in an internal vote. The ballots are thrown into a ballot box and mixed. The votes are properly anoymized. In a digital system, data can be stored without any linked personal information (like the user IDs). If the remaining information is anoynmous data and not covered by the GDPR. In practice, it gets increasingly hard to truly anonymise personal data, especially when data is not very limited and uniform, or can be connected with other available information. New methods and technologies, such as big data analytics and artificial intelligence, are able to match and connect information that humans may not identify as being related. For example: In 2006 the internet company AOL released 20 million searches that were entered into its search engine over three months. The searches of users could be connected via an anonymous ID. As many users entered personal information in the search box, the New York Times was able to quickly find the relevant users. AOL deleted the file later, but it was already widely copied. Some technical solutions that may be useful or even required under the GDPR (e.g. from a security perspective under Article 32 GDPR or as a means of data minimisation under Article 5(1)(c) GDPR ) can get confused with techniques to truly anonymise data. For example: A payment provider and an airline strike a cooperation deal. When customers enter an email address during the airline booking process and the payment provider has the same email address in its files, only the payment provider will be shown as a payment option. The airline pays a lower transaction fee in return. To limit the exchange of customer data, they agree to only share 'hashes' of the email, which is a cryptographic fingerprint of the email address. While you cannot regenerate the email address from the hash value, everyone in possession of the email address can calculate the same hash value and see that the hash matches the email address. The technicians tell their Data Protection Officer that they only exchange anonymous data and there are no privacy issues involved. The Data Protection Officer, however, realises that the airline can single out the relevant customers. The data is therefore personal data and the system falls under the GDPR. There are a number of data types that were already the subject of CJEU case law: Name, date of birth, nationality, gender, ethnicity, religion and language; [ 45 ] Place of birth, nationality, marital status, sex, record of entries into and exits from a country, residence status, particulars of passports issued, previous statements as to domicile, reference numbers issued by an authority, reference numbers used by authorities; [ 46 ] Municipality, information concerning the earned and unearned income and assets of a person; [ 47 ] Salaries of employees of a public body; [ 48 ] Name of a person in conjunction with his telephone coordinates or information about his working conditions or hobbies; [ 49 ] Working hours and times, as well as the corresponding breaks and intervals; [ 50 ] Telephone numbers, employment and hobbies; [ 51 ] Dynamic IP address; [ 52 ] Video surveillance; [ 53 ] The content of written exams; [ 54 ] Fingerprints. [ 55 ] As always, whether or not data is actually personal data is a matter of context and case-by-case analysis. Processing is another central requirement for the application of the GDPR. It is defined as \" any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data \". The notion of processing is formulated broadly by the GDPR as 'any operation or set of operations'. The inclusion of 'a set of operations' means that, within the GDPR, the word 'processing ' may refer to a single processing operation or a set of any number of operations. The term processing is further explained by a list of non-exhaustive examples: Collection (targeted procurement of single pieces of data), such as offering online registrations or contact forms; [ 56 ] Recording (continuous procurement of data flows), such as operating surveillance cameras or similar sensors; Organisation (systematic ordering to enhance access and evaluation of information), such as the allocation of information within databases; Structuring (ordering data according to certain criteria), e.g. in numeric or alphabetical order; [ 57 ] Storage (saving information to a physical and readable format), such as information on paper, files, disks, drives or cloud servers; [ 58 ] Adaptation (adjustments to the content of information according to specific criteria), e.g. updating information on age, address or income; [ 59 ] Alteration (changes to the form or content of data), such as corrections, pseudonymisation or anonymisation; [ 60 ] Retrieval (accessing stored information), for example loading information to be displayed on a device; [ 61 ] Consultation (accessing stored information through targeted searches), such as using search routines to find and display data; [ 62 ] Use (catch-all term for all active operations conducted on personal data), e.g. using addresses to deliver orders or mails; [ 63 ] Disclosure by transmission ('pushing' information to recipients or other third parties), such as sharing customer information with another company; Disclosure by dissemination (untargeted distribution of information to unlimited recipients), e.g. in newspapers, radio or tv broadcasting; [ 64 ] Disclosure by otherwise making available (generally any other form of disclosure), such as providing information on websites or search engines; [ 65 ] Alignment (comparison of information with other, specific requirements), such as grid investigations or \u2018dragnet\u2019 actions; Combination (merging information), such as profiling (see also Article 4(4) GDPR); [ 66 ] Restriction (marking for limited further processing, see also Article 4(3) GDPR), such as deactivation of information on a website; [ 67 ] Erasure (irreversible rendering of information impossible to access), such as overwriting data multiple times; [ 68 ] Destruction (physically destroying the data carrier), such as shredding of files. [ 69 ] The only major exception to the above is where the controller remains completely passive without taking any active action towards information that is imposed by the data subject. [ 70 ] To be considered as 'processing' the operation in question has to be performed on personal data. Processing of other data does not fall under the definition. Processing can be carried out by fully automated, semi-automated, or non-automated means. It does not require the use of any electronic means and can also be carried out completely manually. [ 71 ] For example: A person manually enters names into a system. The names are processed. The data is then stored and never looked at again. Storage is also processing and needs to comply with the GDPR. After years the hard drive that the data was stored on gets shredded. The destruction equally constitutes processing. Restriction is a specific form of processing. The restriction of processing means neither a complete prohibition to process nor an erasure of personal data, it is best described as a freezing of personal data for a certain period of time. Usually, restrictions to the processing of personal data occur when the data is not required for the purpose for which it was originally collected, but cannot be deleted due to legal obligations. [ 72 ] The restriction of processing can also be initiated by request of a data subject under the requirements of Article 18(1) GDPR or a data protection authority according to Article 58(2)(g) GDPR . For more information see the commentary on these provisions. For example: Greta finds out that a credit ranking agency holds wrong information about her. As a consequence she cannot get a cell phone contract. The credit ranking agency has a huge backlog when correcting data. In the meantime the wrong information can be marked as contested and not used in the system. The provision only applies to stored personal data. Personal data that is not at rest do not seem to be subject to a restriction of processing. Marking the data is usually done by labels in systems or any other similar approach. The restriction is not just limited to the marking of data, but must have the aim of limiting certain personal data only for very limited purposes. [ 73 ] In practice this means that systems also have to react to the marking and, for example, not include the data in other processing operations anymore. Obviously the limitation can only have an effect in the future. The fact that the law only requires one to 'aim' for the limitation should not be understood that the limitation must not be fully implemented. Technically, the restriction is realized through markers on the data in question which block it from further processing in the future. [ 74 ] In terms of automated systems, the restriction shall be ensured by technical safeguards to ensure the personal data is not subject to further processing or changes. [ 75 ] In terms of non-automated systems, marking the data is typically not sufficient but requires a relocation to a separate storage system with access restrictions. [ 76 ] Restrictive methods could include temporarily moving selected data to another processing system, making it unavailable to users, or temporarily removing published data from a website. [ 77 ] In case, the data subject needs to be informed about the restriction of processing of their personal data according to Article 18(3) GDPR . Profiling is a specific form of processing. The concept is used in various provisions of the GDPR such as its territorial application, see Article 3(2)(b) GDPR , or automated decision making, see Article 22 GDPR . Profiling also triggers information duties under Articles 13(2)(f) and 14(2)(g) GDPR; access rights under Article 15(1)(h) GDPR ; or the the need to perform data protection impact assessments under Article 35(3)(a) GDPR . Profiling is defined as a processing operation with the purpose of evaluating personal aspects of a natural person. Despite the rather specific general meaning of 'profiling', there is no minimal threshold of how much data must be used to constitute profiling or how personal or sensitive the personal aspects should be. The definition is therefore very broad and includes any way of calculating personal aspects of individuals. Profiling is typically done by the application of statistical-mathematical measures to personal data that produce analysis of predictions of personal aspects. [ 78 ] Manual review of personal data to evaluate personal aspects does not constitute profiling, as the definition requires 'automated processing'. The definition provides a non-exhaustive list over common types of profiling, such as: performance at work; economic situation; health; personal preferences; interests; reliability; behaviour; location; or movements. Practical examples of 'profiling' are therefore: Creating customer preferences based on previous purchases or clicks; Maintaining customer profiles for more efficient marketing; [ 79 ] Operating systems for credit rating/scoring; [ 80 ] Operating e-Recruitment Systems. [ 81 ] EDPB Guidelines : see EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 1/2025 on Pseudonymisation\u2019, 16 January 2025 (Version for public consultation), available here . Pseudonymisation is a form of processing that alters personal data so that identifying information is either separated or replaced to no longer allow its attribution to a particular data subject without the use of additional information. The aim of pseudonymisation as a technical and organisational measure is to reduce risks for the data subjects while still enabling controllers and processors to process the data and help them to meet their obligations under the GDPR, such as data minimisation or as part of a data security concept. [ 82 ] Pseudonymisation should, inter alia, reduce the risk and potential detrimental consequences of the (unauthorised) disclosure of direct identifiers on the confidentiality of the original data. Also the risk that personal data is unlawfully further processed should be reduced by pseudonymisation. [ 83 ] For example: A processor receives pseudonymised data from a number of controllers for a similar purpose. Due to the pseudonymisation of the data, the consequences of a data breach at the processor are less severe than in case directly identifiebly information were leaked. Also the risk of unlawful further processing (e.g. using data of one controller for purposes of another controller) is reduced by the usage of pseudonymisation. In such a case the additional information capable to attribute the data so specific data subject should not be in the hand of the processor. At the same time, peeudonymised data is still useful to the controller and/or processor since the information contained in the original data can generally sill be used and even the linkage of various information to the same person can still be achieved due to the use of pseudonymes instead of direct identifier. This process also allows for the later re-attribution of the pseudonymised data to the original data subject. [ 84 ] In other words, pseudonymised data, which could be attributed to an identified or identifiable person with the help of some additional information, is personal data. \"Pseudonymised data, which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional information, is to be considered information on an identifiable natural person,7 and is therefore personal. This statement also holds true if pseudonymised data and additional information are not in the hands of the same person. If pseudonymised data and additional information could be combined having regard to the means reasonably likely to be used by the controller or by another person, then the pseudonymised data is personal. Even if all additional information retained by the pseudonymising controller has been erased, the pseudonymised data becomes anonymous only if the conditions for anonymity are met.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 1/2025 on Pseudonymisation\u2019, 16 January 2025 (Version for public consultation), margin number 22. Pseudonymisation presupposes the existence of (additional) information enabling the identification of the data subject (i.e. the attribution of the data to a specific data subject. The very existence of such additional information means that data that have undergone pseudonymisation cannot be regarded, in all cases, as anonymous data. [ 85 ] Therefore, for the controller pseudonymising the data, the data continues to be personal data. However, the assessment can be different for other persons receiving the pseudonymised data. In case pseudonymisation effectively prevents a person other than the controller from identifying the data subject, the data cannot be considered personal data for those other persons. [ 86 ] \"[I]n so far as it cannot be ruled out that those third parties have means reasonably allowing them to attribute pseudonymised data to the data subject, such as cross-checking with other data at their disposal, the data subject must be regarded as identifiable as regards both that transfer and any subsequent processing of those data by those third parties. In such circumstances, pseudonymised data should be considered to be personal in nature. \" CJEU - C-413/23 P - EDPS v SRB (Concept of personal data) , margin number 85. There are however some provisions that refer to pseudoymized personal data and treat it (slightly) different than personal data: Implementing security safeguards (see Article 32(1)(a) GDPR ); Handling of personal data breaches (see Article 34(3)(a) GDPR ); Changing purposes of data processing ( Article 6(4)(e) GDPR ); Serving principles of data minimization and security ( Article 5(1)(c)(f) GDPR ); Implementing Data Protection by Design and Default ( Article 25 GDPR ). In order to count as pseudonymised data, the personal data must be processed in a way that cannot be attributed to specific data subject without the use of additional information. This process is sometimes referred to as 'pseudonymising transformation'. [ 87 ] The pseudonymised data set itself, therefore cannot be attributed to an identified or identifiable person. Only with additional information it is possible to attribute the pseudonymised data to an identified or identifiable person again. Generally, in course of the pseudonymising transformation the identifying information of the original data is replaced with pseudonym as new identifiers which cannot directly be attributed to a specific person. [ 88 ] Common mistake: A common mistake is to just replace the direct identifiers of a data set (e.g. full name of data subjects) with a pseudonym and then consider the data set to be pseudonymised. However, data could still be attributed to a specific person via a combination of other information in the data set, such as age, gender, height, family status, income. This data is sometimes referred to as 'quasi-identifiers'. [ 89 ] For example, it could be clear to a person processing such data set which data could is attributed to a specific person even without the persons name. E.g. a department head could be identified due to her age, gender and salary. Additional information (e.g. tables matching pseudonyms with the identifying attributes they replace) make it possible to attribute pseudonymised data to data subjects again. [ 90 ] Information allowing this attribution of the data subject needs to be stored separately and must be secured by technical or organisational measures to prevent identification. [ 91 ] \"Additional information is information whose use enables the attribution of pseudonymised data to identified or identifiable persons. The generation, or use of additional information is an inherent part of the pseudonymising transformation\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 1/2025 on Pseudonymisation\u2019, 16 January 2025 (Version for public consultation), margin number 19 (available here). It should be noted that the additional information permitting the attribution of pseudonymised data to data subjects will itself regularly be personal data. [ 92 ] Examples for the pseudonymisation of personal data include: Replacement of names through ID\u2019s, codes or aliases; [ 93 ] Encryption of personal data; [ 94 ] Hashing of personal data. [ 95 ] The distinction between anonymized and pseudonymised data follows the decisive criteria of any reasonable likeliness from sentences 3 and 4 of Recital 26 GDPR, considering the cost, time, and available technology required to identify the data subject. However, considering the recent emergence of big data analytics and advanced data processing capabilities, the process of anonymisation is becoming increasingly difficult. [ 96 ] Common mistake: Pseudonymisation has to be distinguished from anonymisation. Anonymisation is the definite deletion of any information allowing for an identification of the data subject. The GDPR therefore does not apply to anonymised data. [ 97 ] Pseudonymisation, on the other hand, generally allows for an identification through the use of additional of information and is therefore reversible. [ 98 ] The definition of a 'filing system' is relevant for the application of the GDPR in cases of non-automated data processing (see Article 2(1) GDPR ). A filing system is characterized through a structured set of personal data. The data can be stored within either single or multiple data carriers in a centralized or decentralized manner. Also, a filing system does not require the storage of information on multiple persons. Storing structured information on a single person may qualify as filing system. [ 99 ] A set of data is only a structured filing system if it is accessible according to specific criteria. The structure of the information must allow a targeted search of personal data. [ 100 ] For example, when personal data on a particular person is 'retrievable' it already satisfies this requirement. [ 101 ] Examples are: Paper archives, sorted by name, date or any other system; Salary lists on employees; [ 102 ] Saved letter-correspondence with customers; [ 103 ] Covid-19-Guest-Lists sorted by date. [ 104 ] The controller is the main addressee of obligations under the GDPR. The controller is defined as the body that determines the purposes and means of the processing. This broad definition of the concept of controller is intended to ensure the effective and complete protection of data subjects. [ 105 ] The GDPR foresees that the controller must be determined based on the objective facts of the case. This means that mere declarations in contracts, privacy notices and alike do not constitute a binding determination of controllership. The objective approach requires a detailed assessment, but also prevents so-called 'forum shopping' and responsibility shifting. A controller can be any natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body. A legal personality is not a necessary condition for the classification of a controller. [ 106 ] It is necessary to assign the determination of purpose and means (see below) to a responsible entity. Departments, individual establishments, or other elements that are not legally independent usually form one controller together with the legal entity that they belong to. [ 107 ] It is after all a matter of national law if, for example, workers councils within a company or individual government entities form a legally separate body or not. If they are legally separate holders of rights and duties, they can form a separate controller. If a person within the controller acts outside of their assigned capacity and processes personal data for their own purpose, their acts cannot be attributed to the controller and they become their own controller, with their own responsibilities of any processing operation they may undertake. [ 108 ] For example: In Member State 'A' schools are their own legal entity. In Member State 'B' schools are part of the Ministry of Education and are not separate holders of rights. In Member State 'A' the school is typically the controller for processing operations within it, while in Member State 'B' the Ministry is typically the controller. If the computer science teacher in either school decides to use a school server to host his own private software project, the teacher is typically considered a separate controller. The key element of the controller definition is the focus on the entity making the relevant determinations for any processing activity. The determinations of persons acting on behalf of an entity are attributed to that entity. It is necessary to review which entity, or element within an entity, objectively made determinations about the purpose and means. This includes decisions on \u2018whether\u2019, \u2018why\u2019 and \u2018how\u2019 the personal data is processed. [ 109 ] Merely formal declarations are not relevant. Especially in complex situations where many players are involved in the processing operation, the proper identification of the controller may prove to be complex. For example: Company 'A' offers an app to users. The head of the IT department suddenly decides that personal data of users will be processed for the purpose of product improvement and advertisement of the app itself. The CEO of the company does not raise any objections. Company 'A' is the controller for the processing operations and ultimately responsible for complying with the GDPR. Personal data may only be processed for a specified, explicit and legitimate purpose (see Article 5(1)(b) GDPR ). The body that decides over the purpose is typically the controller. The determination of the purpose it the primary element to review when determining controllership. [ 110 ] The means include the personal data that is processed to achieve the purpose; the duration of the processing; the recipients of personal data; as well as the technical means to process personal data, such as hardware or software. [ 111 ] The controller must only determine the means, but must not control them physically. For example: A company uses an external service for statistical analysis. The systems of the external service collect personal data and calculate the results. The company does not even have access to the raw information. Nevertheless, the company has determined the purposes and means of the processing (including the described system) and is hence the controller. Article 4(7) GDPR allows that specific EU or national law ( lex specialis ) may assign the controllership to a certain entity for specific processing operations. Such provisions typically define controllership when private entities act in the public interest or are fulfilling public tasks. The clause also allows Member States to clarify controllership among different public bodies or elements. Such explicit determinations in EU or national law should not be confused with generic national laws that assign certain duties to an entity without determining controllership itself. In case national law makes such a determination, it should be ascertained whether that law specifies the controller or lays down the criteria applicable to its nomination. [ 112 ] \"It must also be stated that, having regard to the broad definition of the concept of \u2018controller\u2019 within the meaning of Article 4(7) of the GDPR, the determination of the purposes and means of the processing and, where appropriate, the nomination of that controller by national law may not only be explicit but also implicit. In the latter case, that determination must nevertheless be derived with sufficient certainty from the role, task and powers conferred on the person or entity concerned [...]\" CJEU - C-200/23 - Agentsia po vpisvaniyata , margin number 74.. The determination must not necessarily be explicit. \"[...] it must be stated that, having regard to the broad definition of the concept of \u2018controller\u2019 within the meaning of point 7 of Article 4 of the GDPR, the determination of the purposes and means of the processing and, where appropriate, the nomination of that controller by national law may not only be explicit but also implicit.\" CJEU - C-231/22 - \u00c9tat belge (Data processed by an official journal) , margin number 30. Generally the CJEU appears to allow for a broad interpretation of the opening clause for determination. \" [...] Article 4(7) of the GDPR must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation which designates, as controller, an auxiliary administrative entity lacking legal personality and legal capacity of its own, without specifying, in a precise manner, the specific processing operations of personal data for which that entity is responsible or the purpose of those operations in so far as, first, such an entity is able to fulfil, in accordance with that national legislation, the obligations on a controller towards data subjects with respect to the protection of personal data and, second, that national legislation determines, explicitly or at least implicitly, the scope of the processing of personal data for which that entity is responsible. CJEU - C\u2011638/23 - Amt der Tiroler Landesregierung , margin number 49. In cases of joint decisions on the means and purposes of the processing of personal data, these responsibilities can be shared with different entities. In such cases of a \u2018joint\u2019 or \u2018co-controllership\u2019 the entities have to determine their respective responsibilities for the processing within an agreement according to Article 26 GDPR . Important, however, is utlimately the factual influence on the processing of the personal data [ 113 ] (see Recital 79 GDPR). In this regard, the participation and influence on the purpose and means can be very different among the actors involved in the data processing. In order to ensure an effective and complete protection of the data subject in this regard, the concept of \u2018controller\u2019 is interpreted broadly in jurisdiction. [ 114 ] For example, a joint controllership is assumed between: Search-Engine-Operators and the websites on which information is structured, presented and complemented with advertisements within search results; [ 115 ] Facebook and the entity administering pages on the social network; [ 116 ] Websites that integrated elements of a third-party controller, such as a \u2018Like Button\u2019. [ 117 ] In each case, however, the responsibility for each entity is strictly limited to the part where it has influence on the purposes and means of the processing. This raises especial relevance to clarify the responsibilities of each controller, as required by Article 26 GDPR . EDPB Guidelines: On this provision there are the Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR In practice most controllers do not process all their personal data themselves, but use various external providers, such as hosting providers, SaaS providers or so-called 'Cloud' providers, that process data on their behalf. The GDPR regulates these 'processors', as well as the interplay between the controller and the processor. Once an entity qualifies as a 'processor', many provisions of the GDPR apply, such as the required implementation of technical organizational measures (see Article 32 GDPR ) as well as the possibility of being fined (see Article 82 GDPR ). Of additional relevance is Article 28 GDPR , that shall ensure meeting the requirements of the GDPR through binding data processing agreements. For further information, see also the commentary on Article 28(3) GDPR . It should be noted that this definition includes the initial processor engaged directly by a controller as well as sub-processors along the processing chain (processors engaged by another processor). [ 118 ] Just like a controller, a processor can be any natural person, legal person, public authority, agency, or body. This means that, at least in principle, there are no specific limitations regarding the type of actor that can assume this role. The processor must be a \" separate entity \". The controller must entrust the task to an external organization, which includes companies belonging to the same corporate group but does not include a department within the same company. Equally, there is no processor when the controller decides to assign a part of the processing to its employees or other individuals acting under its \" direct authority \", as outlined in Article 29 of the GDPR. For example: Internal units that process personal data on behalf of another department within the same legal entity (e.g. an IT department) are not processors, but are part of the controller. The processor must process data \" on behalf of the controller \" and therefore, unlike the controller, does not determine the purposes and means of the processing.  In other words, the controller decides on means and purposes (Article 4(7) GDPR) and the processor's activities are done for the benefit and under the instructions of the controller. [ 119 ] Processing data \" on behalf of the controller \" excludes any scenario of processing data for the processor's \" own purposes .\" In such a situation, it is assumed that the \"processor\" has exceeded or otherwise violated the controller's lawful instructions, [ 120 ] becoming an independent controller itself as stated in Article 28(10) GDPR. The processor is bound by the instructions given by the controller, solely carrying out the technical operations for the processing of personal data. [ 121 ] For example: \"Service provider MarketinZ provides promotional advertisement and direct marketing services to various companies. Company GoodProductZ concludes a contract with MarketinZ, according to which the latter company provides commercial advertising for GoodProductZ customers and is referred to as data processor. However, MarketinZ decides to use GoodProducts customer database also for other purposes than advertising for GoodProducts, such as developing their own business activity. The decision to add an additional purpose to the one for which the personal data were transferred converts MarketinZ into a data controller for this set of processing operations and their processing for this purpose would constitute an infringement of the GDPR.\" [ 122 ] \"The nature of the service will determine whether the processing activity amounts to processing of personal data on behalf of the controller within the meaning of the GDPR. In practice, where the provided service is not specifically targeted at processing personal data or where such processing does not constitute a key element of the service, the service provider may be in a position to independently determine the purposes and means of that processing which is required in order to provide the service. In that situation, the service provider is to be seen as a separate controller and not as a processor. A case-by-case analysis remains necessary, however, in order to ascertain the degree of influence each entity effectively has in determining the purposes and means of the processing.\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR', 7 July 2021 (Version 2.1), margin number 82 footnotes omitted. The EDPB provides a number of specific examples for situations a service provider for the controller can be considered a processor. [ 123 ] A special form of the processor is the 'sub-processor'. This is another processor, that is engaged by the processor. In theory there can be any number of sub-sub-processors. In practice such setups are very hard to manage for a controller. For further information see the commentary on Article 28(2) and (4) GDPR . In practice major IT companies (usually 'processors') are often more in control of processing operations than their commercial customers (usually 'controllers'). They usually offer a standard product with very specific terms and conditions, while many controllers may not. Therefore, it can be difficult to distinguish a 'joint controller' or 'co-controller' from a processor. Usually each processor also conducts processing operations where it is itself the controller. This is also the case whenever the processor acts against the orders of the controller and processes personal data for further purposes. In all these situations, it qualifies as a controller. [ 124 ] It is occasionally argued that processing in the controller-processor relationship is somewhat privileged (e.g. that no legal basis under Article 6 GDPR is required for the sharing of personal data between the two parties). However, the possibility to engage a processor should not reduce the level of data protection for data subjects. Specifically, Article 28 GDPR provides for obligations for controllers and processors to ensure this (see commentary on Article 28 GDPR). [ 125 ] In this regard, the Working Party 29 [ 126 ] provides some references as examples of controller-processor relationships: Outsourcing of call centers for customer communications; [ 127 ] Outsourcing of mail services; [ 128 ] Cloud Hosting and grid computing; [ 129 ] A separate entity specialized in data processing within a group of companies. [ 130 ] EDPB Guidelines: On this provision there are the Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR The 'recipient' is an umbrella term and defined as anybody (like controllers, processors, third parties) to whom personal data is disclosed to. Therefore, whenever a controller sends personal data to another entity, this entity classifies as recipient. [ 131 ] The concept of the recipients is primarily relevant in terms of information obligations of the controller. According to Article 13 to 15 GDPR, [ 132 ] the controller has to inform the data subject about recipients or categories of recipients of their personal data. The reasoning behind this is that the controller, whenever disclosing personal data to another entity, cannot completely take over responsibility for processing on its own any more. [ 133 ] Listing the recipients ensures that the data subject is fully informed as to the whereabouts of their personal data. Just like a controller or processor, a recipient can be any natural person, legal person, public authority, agency, or body. On the other hand, particular units within a company, such as the staff council or dependent establishments of the controller, are not considered recipients. [ 134 ] The core element of the definition is the 'disclosure' of personal data. This includes any voluntary act of data sharing, including transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available (see Article 4(2) GDPR). [ 135 ] There is an ongoing discussion as to whether a 'processor' can also be considered a 'recipient'. On the one hand, the processor is generally acting on behalf of the controller and therefore not a third party. [ 136 ] However, the concept of the recipient is completely independent of the third-party. [ 137 ] With Article 4(8) GDPR the processor received its own legal identity. Considering the additional risk from any disclosure of data, the processor is also to be considered a recipient. Therefore, Article 28 GDPR does not relieve the controller to inform the data subjects about its processors as recipients according to Article 13 to 15 GDPR . [ 138 ] Another exception exists regarding independent financial and administrative public authorities, such as tax or customs authorities receiving personal data on a particular inquiry. [ 139 ] These inquiries, however, must be in the general interest and in accordance with Union or Member State law. [ 140 ] The term 'third party' is used to describe anyone other than the data subject. This notion becomes relevant mostly in terms of evaluating interests, such as in Article 6 (1)(f) GDPR. [ 141 ] 'Third party' constitutes a negative definition, as any natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or body different from: the data subject; controller; processors; or any other person authorized to process personal data by the controller. While an entity may be a third party may from the perspective a given controller, it may itself be a controller or processor for any processing operation it conducts itself. The notion of a 'third party' is therefore not absolute, but based on the circumstances of a certain processing operation. Following from the definition, processors or sub-contractors authorized by the controller for processing are not considered third parties. [ 142 ] Also, dependent branches or departments of a controller are not considered third parties, except for where they are located outside the EU. [ 143 ] Similarly, internal staff of the controller are not a third parties, unless the employee uses personal data for their own purposes outside of the employment context. [ 144 ] In this case, although considered a third party from the point of the controller, they become controllers themselves for processing the personal data. [ 145 ] EDPB Guidelines: On this provision there are the Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR Consent is one of the legal basis mentioned under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. It manifests the data subject\u2019s agreement to the processing of their personal data. The requirements for consent require a joint reading of Articles 4(11), 6(1)(a), 7 and 8 GDPR. For the definition of 'consent', see the more commentary under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR and Article 7 GDPR . For the definition of 'explicit consent', see the commentary under Article 9(2)(a) GDPR . EDPB Guidelines: on this provision there are EDPB Guidelines 05/2020 on consent under Regulation 2016/679 This provision defines a personal data breach as a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed. In such cases, the controller will be unable to ensure compliance with the principles or processing set out in Article 5 GDPR. [ 146 ] The definition of  a personal data breach is specifically relevant for the notification duties to the supervisory authority and the affected data subjects under Articles 33 and 34 GDPR respectively. [ 147 ] The definition of a data breach requires a security breach, such as a failure of technical or organisational safeguards implemented by the controller according to Article 32 GDPR . These failures can either be caused by accident (e.g. through mishandling of personal data by the controller, employees and alike) or by unlawful acts (e.g. targeted attacks, hacking or a physical break in). The use of the \"term\" accidental makes clear that the motives of the person responsible for the data breach is insignificant, while the \"unlawful\" refers to any breach of a legal provision. [ 148 ] As a consequence, the incident has to lead to an accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration of data or the unauthorised disclosure or access thereof. These consequences can be categorised in accordance with three information security principles: breach of confidentiality : in case of an unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data; breach of integrity : in case of an unauthorised or accidental alteration of personal data; breach of availability : in case of n accidental or unauthorised loss of access to, or destruction of, personal data. [ 149 ] However, it is possible for a breach to be a combination of two or even all three of those types. [ 150 ] For example: A controller wants to make it easy for its employees to work from anywhere at any time. Therefore, the controller makes it possible to access some specific data (including personal data) online. However, it did not consider that also other people might access the data and only finds out about such accesses when checking the log files related to the documents. If third parties were only able to access (but not alter or delete) the documents, it would be a breach of confidentiality. If they could also alter and delete the documents, it would be a breach of confidentiality as well as integrity and availability. \" Destruction \" is the irreversible erasure of personal data from their material support or a permanent impairment of the system enabling the processing. On the other hand, \" loss \" must be understood as unavailability of still existing data or processing systems. Finally, \" alteration \" means any significant change to the data or the systems. \"Disclosure\" can be understood as any act that makes the personal data accessible by someone else. [ 151 ] \"Access\" on the other hand means the action by the other person accessing the personal data. [ 152 ] What is fundamental here is that disclosure to and excess by third parties was unauthorised . The wording does not clarify whether \"unauthorised\" refers only to the authority under the GDPR to disclose or access data or whether also the obligation covers also objective obligation of confidentiality established by the law (i.e. a lawyers confidentiality obligation). A restrictive approach must be preferred, as obligations of confidentiality in national law differ in each member state and are usually set forth with the aim to guarantee rights and interests other than data protection. [ 153 ] In any case where personal data is accidentally or unlawfully disclosed to a third party in a way that the third party had the possibility to access the data without it being certain that the third party actually accessed the data, this qualifies as personal data breach through the mere possibility to access that data. Any real access to the disclosed data is not necessary. [ 154 ] \"What is meant by \u201cdestruction\u201d of personal data should be quite clear: this is where the data no longer exists, or no longer exists in a form that is of any use to the controller. \u201cDamage\u201d should also be relatively clear: this is where personal data has been altered, corrupted, or is no longer complete. In terms of \u201closs\u201d of personal data, this should be interpreted as the data may still exist, but the controller has lost control or access to it, or no longer has it in its possession. Finally, unauthorised or unlawful processing may include disclosure of personal data to (or access by) recipients who are not authorised to receive (or access) the data, or any other form of processing which violates the GDPR.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 9/2022 on personal data breach notification under GDPR\u2019, 28 March 2023 (Version 2.0), margin number 14. Although the transmission and storage of data are explicitly highlighted, any type of processing the concerned data is sufficient. [ 155 ] Common mistake: Not every security incident is also a personal data breach. If, for example, only non-personal data was unlawfully accessed by a third party, this would constitute a security incident but not a personal data breach as defined in this provision. Therefore, all personal data breaches are security incidents, not all security incidents are also personal data breaches. [ 156 ] Some examples for personal data breaches are: Hacking-attacks on systems involving personal data; [ 157 ] Missing access protection to data storages or buildings; [ 158 ] Sending data to unintended recipients; [ 159 ] Employees unlawfully distributing data to third parties; [ 160 ] Accidentally publishing or leaking data on website; [ 161 ] Loss of physical data carriers; [ 162 ] Destruction of data storing infrastructure; [ 163 ] Unrestorable encryption through Ransomware; [ 164 ] Unlocked storage of employee files, [ 165 ] accidental or unlawful. EDPB Guidelines : EDPB, 'Guidelines 01/2021 on Examples regarding Personal Data Breach Notification', 14 December 2021 (Version 2.0) (available here ). \u2018Genetic data\u2019 refers to data on the inherited or acquired genetic characteristics of a natural person which gives unique information about their physiology or health. Accordingly, the data must allow for clear conclusions on growth, metabolism, appearance, disease or alike, both already existent or emerging in the future. [ 166 ] Examples for obtaining such data are given in Recital 34 GDPR, mentioning in particular chromosomal, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), or ribonucleic acid (RNA) analyses. The classification of genetic data is becoming relevant in terms of Article 9(1) GDPR , which only allows its processing under strict requirements. [ 167 ] This is due to the sensitive character of such data, allowing a unique identification of the data subject and, at the same time, revealing personal health data [ 168 ] on them and biological relatives. [ 169 ] Especially in terms of heritage diseases, genetic data carries a high risk of abuse in terms of employment and insurance. [ 170 ] \u2018Biometric data\u2019 means data referring to the physical, physiological and behavioural characteristics of a natural person obtained from specific technical processing allowing for a unique identification. While this generally includes any means to analyse and measure the characteristics of humans, [ 171 ] the technical processing and unique identification requirements place higher burdens. The definition itself uses facial images and fingerprints [ 172 ] as examples for biometric data. However, the requirement for specific technical processing ensures that simple pictures or even passport photographs shall not be considered as such. [ 173 ] Although, further processing through the application of facial recognition software would qualify the extracted information as biometric data. In this regard: IRIS Scanners; DNS-Comparisons; voice or gait pattern analyses; [ 174 ] as well as typing patterns or even handwritten signatures, [ 175 ] may be considered as biometric data. Other data that does not allow an unique identification, such as body size or blood type, may not be considered biometric data. [ 176 ] However, these could then fall under the definition of \u2018health data\u2019 that offers similar protection to that afforded to biometric data, according to Article 9(1) GDPR . \u2018Data concerning health\u2019, or simply \u2018health data\u2019, means any data related to the physical or mental health of a natural person, especially the procurement of health care services revealing such information. According to Recital 35 GDPR, these include all data referring to the health status of the data subject from the past, present or future. In this regard, any information on diseases, risks and disabilities - in addition to medical treatment and history - of a particular natural person explicitly qualifies as health data. [ 177 ] Examples for health data includes information about: Addictions to alcohol, drugs or medications as well as the participation in self-help groups; [ 178 ] Hospitalizations, sick notes and sick payments; [ 179 ] Information the physical or mental invalidity to work; [ 180 ] Data from health or fitness apps on eating or movement patterns, for example from wearables and smartphones. [ 181 ] The notion of health data is therefore broader than \u2018medicinal data\u2019. [ 182 ] Furthermore, it strongly overlaps with the notions of genetic and biometric data, [ 183 ] in order to allow a seamless and high level of protection within the scope of Article 9 GDPR . [ 184 ] For further information, please check the commentary on Article 9 GDPR . EDPB Guidelines: on this provision there are EDPB Guidelines 03/2020 on the processing of data concerning health for the purpose of scientific research in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak If a controller or a processor have establishments in more than one member state, identifying its 'main establishment' is the first step to recognising the lead supervisory authority in a cross-border procedure under Article 56 GDPR . The main establishment of an entity must be determined according to objective criteria. [ 185 ] As the main establishment determines the relevant supervisory authority, the Working Party 29 stressed that the GDPR does not permit 'forum shopping' and conclusions cannot be based solely on statements by the controller or processor. The controller or processor\u2019s analysis can be overturned based on an objective examination of the relevant facts. [ 186 ] As a general rule, the main establishment of a controller should be the place of its central administration in the Union, or in other words, \" the place where decisions about the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are taken and this place has the power to have such decisions implemented \". [ 187 ] Recital 22 GDPR defines an establishment as \" the effective and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements \". The legal form of such arrangements is irrelevant. According to C-230/14 - Weltimmo , an establishment depends on \" both the degree of stability of the arrangements and the effective exercise of activities in that other Member State [which] must be interpreted in the light of the specific nature of the economic activities and the provision of services concerned\". [ 188 ] In this regard, merely the presence of a single representative can constitute a stable arrangement, when they are acting with a sufficient degree of stability and have the necessary equipment to provide the specific services in the member states concerned. [ 189 ] If a controller\u2019s main establishment is not the place of its central administration in the EU, the exception to the general rules kicks in. In this case it is necessary to determine the establishment based on where the effective and real exercise of main decisions on the purposes and means of processing take place. [ 190 ] It should depend neither on the place of the processing nor the use of technical means and technologies for processing personal data or processing activities. Instead, to determine the controller\u2019s main establishment the Working Party 29 developed several guiding questions: [ 191 ] Where are decisions about the purposes and means of the finally signed off\u2019? Where are decisions about business activities that involve data processing made? Where does the power to have decisions implemented effectively lie? Where is the Director with responsibility for cross border processing located? Where is the controller or processor registered as a company? Similarly to the rules for controllers, the main establishment of a processor located in multiple member states shall also be the place of its central administration. See above for details on determining the central administration. However, when there is no central administration in the Union, the rules applying to processors are formulated differently. In such cases, the main establishment of a processor is where the main processing activities take place in a Union\u2019s establishment subject to the obligations under GDPR. This implies that the processing of personal data does not need to be carried out by the relevant establishment itself, but only in in the context of its activities within the scope of the GDPR. [ 192 ] The meaning of 'the context of activities' has already been specified in C-131/12 - Google Spain . The CJEU build on a broad definition of 'establishment' and clarified that merely the intention of a member state\u2019s establishment to provide advertisement space for a third country undertaking constitutes processing of personal data in the context of the Union\u2019s establishment. [ 193 ] Following up on the CJEU judgement, the Working Party 29 specified that EU law may apply to data processing activities of controllers or processors established outside the EU \" even if the local establishment is not actually taking any role in the data processing itself \". [ 194 ] This reasoning can be based on an \" inextricable link \" between activities of an establishment in the EU and data processing by a non-EU controller or processor. [ 195 ] Recital 36 GDPR explains that \" in cases involving both the controller and the processor, the competent lead supervisory authority should remain the supervisory authority of the Member State where the controller has its main establishment \". This is not reflected in the text of the relevant Articles. For details see the commentary on Article 56 GDPR . Where a controller or a processor not established in the Union falls under the territorial scope of Article 3(2) GDPR due to processing activities related to data subjects in the Union, it must, in accordance with Article 27 GDPR , appoint a representative in the EU. Representatives are any legal or natural persons established in the union, designated by a controller or processor. For more details and exceptions to the obligation to designate a representative see the commentary on Article 27 GDPR . An 'enterprise\u2019 means any natural or legal person, partnerships or associations regularly engaged in economic activities. With this definition, the GDPR introduced a broad concept of an enterprise, irrespective of their size, legal form or interests pursued. [ 196 ] An enterprise requires a regular engagement in economic activities, which means activities intended to be carried out over a a long-term and not only in an occasional manner. [ 197 ] Being a 'small [or] medium enterprise' is a precondition for the waiver of the duties under of Articles 30(5) GDPR . While the English version of the GDPR distinguishes between the \u2018enterprise\u2019 and \u2018undertaking\u2019 other language versions merged both into a single notion (like 'Unternehmen' in German or 'entreprise' in French). [ 198 ] This caused confusion around the assessment of fines according to Article 83 GDPR , which by English language refers to the term of undertaking in accordance with Articles 101, 102 TFEU and thereby not to the definition of Article 4(18) GDPR. [ 199 ] The broader definition of an 'undertaking', which includes parent companies and all subsidiaries, leads to higher fines for such structures, when the fine is calculated based on the global turnover. A group of undertakings consists of a leading ('controlling') entity and one or more thereof dependent ('controlled') entities. [ 200 ] The central characteristic for a group of undertakings is therefore, that one entity exerts a dominant influence over the others, for example through ownership or financial participation. [ 201 ] This is usually the case between a holding company and their subsidiaries. [ 202 ] In this regard, the mere possibility of exercising control over the the other entity is sufficient, a real exercise of such control is not necessary. [ 203 ] As long as one entity has the factual power to assert its will over the other entities, [ 204 ] they qualify as group of undertakings. [ 205 ] Two undertakings are sufficient to form a group. [ 206 ] However, a controller giving mere instructions to a processor regarding the processing of personal data does not qualify as a group of undertakings. [ 207 ] The classification as a group of undertakings becomes relevant for several provision across the GDPR, such as The joint designation of a Data Protection Officer ( Article 37(2) GDPR ); The formulation of binding corporate rules (Article 4(20) GDPR, Article 47 GDPR ); The data transfer for internal administrative purposes ( Article 6(1)(f) GDPR ) with Recital 48 GDPR); [ 208 ] The determination of the main establishment (Article 4(16) GDPR, Recital 22 GDPR). However, the notion is to be distinguished from a \" group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity \" who can jointly use binding corporate rules under Article 47 GDPR . These consist of separate and independent entities, which do not exercise control over each other, [ 209 ] and therefore cannot designate a single Data Protection Officer or rely on internal administrative data transfers. Binding corporate rules (short \u2018 BCR \u2019) are data protection policies formulated by controllers or processors established in the Union for transfers of personal data to entities within their group that are established outside the Union. In this regard, binding corporate rules constitute a legal basis to transfer personal data to third countries without an adequacy decision. [ 210 ] However, they only apply to intra-corporate transfers, i.e. between entities of the concerned group of undertakings or enterprises. Transfers to entities outside of these groups are not covered by binding corporate rules. For more information on the requirements and the approval procedure of binding corporate rules, see the commentary on Article 47 GDPR . Supervisory Authorities ('SAs') or, colloquially, 'Data Protection Authorities' ('DPAs') are the independent public authorities responsible for monitoring the application of the GDPR under Article 51 GDPR . Member States can decide to provide only one or multiple supervisory authorities, to reflect their constitutional, organisational and administrative structure. [ 211 ] For example: Austria, France and Ireland have a single supervisory authority for enforcing the GDPR. While the Irish and French supervisory authorities are also in charge of enforcing the ePrivacy Directive 2002/58/EC (Austria gave this power to the Telecoms Regulator). Germany has a federal supervisory authority and at least one authority for each of the sixteen German states. Some states have more than one authority, for different types of controllers. Supervisory authorities act independently (see Article 52 GDPR ) and shall be provided with various competencies ( Articles 55, 56 GDPR ), tasks ( Article 57 GDPR ) and powers ( Article 58 GDPR ). For further information, see the particular commentary on the named articles. Only 'supervisory authorities concerned' have certain roles in the cooperation procedure under Articles 60 to 66 GDPR. Other supervisory authorities may not participate in the relevant procedures. Qualifying a supervisory authority as \u2018concerned\u2019 can result out of three situations as laid out by Article 4(22) GDPR: For a controller or processor, when it is established in a member state of a supervisory authority, for a data subject, when it is residing in the member state of a supervisory authority (likely) substantially affected by the processing of personal data, or where a complaint has been lodged with that supervisory authority. The DPA is concerned when a controller or processor is established in its jurisdiction. This implies any effective and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements, [ 212 ] independent of the form of such arrangements of an actual branch or subsidiary within the union. [ 213 ] This broad understanding is fostered by the EUCJ, including any real and effective activity exercised through stable agreements independently of their formalistic approach as an establishment. [ 214 ] A substantial affection, although not being further specified from the GDPR, indicates that that the processing requires a meaningful impact of at least considerable magnitude on the data subject. [ 215 ] On the contrary, merely the likelihood of such an impact is sufficient, and an actual affection is therefore not required. However, the substantial affection and the likelihood thereof is decided by the DPA on a case to case basis. [ 216 ] In any case, this requires the data subject to reside in the member state of the DPA and therefore to have at least stable links to the state as its permanent habitual centre. [ 217 ] Filing a complaint with a particular supervisory authority makes them a \u2018concerned\u2019 authority. Since complaints can also be filed with DPAs different from where the data subject resides, [ 218 ] the supervisory authority can possibly be 'concerned' without the data subject having a residence within the EU or any (likely) substantial affection. For further information on filing a complaint with a supervisory authority, see the commentary on Article 77 GDPR . The definition of 'cross-border processing' is not intuitive, as not every form of cross-border processing is 'cross-border' under the GDPR. The limited definition in turn limits the application of the \u2018one-stop-shop\u2019 system, which is further described within the commentary of Article 56 GDPR . The notion of establishment is again to be interpreted broadly. It is any effective and real exercise of activities through stable arrangements, [ 219 ] independent of the formal declarations as a branch or subsidiary within the Union. [ 220 ] Furthermore, the processing is not required to be carried out within the establishment itself, but can also happen in the context of its activities. If the establishment in the EU is not directly processing the personal data, an extricable link between the activities of the establishment and the processing is already sufficient. [ 221 ] Only remote links to the processing in question may not involve another entity and therefore not form a \u2018cross border processing\u2019. [ 222 ] A substantial affection, again indicates that that the processing requires a meaningful impact of at least considerable magnitude on the data subject. [ 223 ] In this regard, the mere likelihood of such an impact is sufficient, an actual affection is therefore not required. However, the substantial affection and the likelihood thereof is decided by the DPA on a case by case basis. [ 224 ] A \u2018relevant and reasoned objection\u2019 is an objection by a supervisory authority concerned [ 225 ] to a draft decision provided by a lead supervisory authority. [ 226 ] When such an objection is submitted by the supervisory authorities concerned, the lead supervisory authority can either follow the objection (see Article 60(4) GDPR ) or submit the matter to the EDPB (see Article 65(4) GDPR ). According to this provision the objection by the supervisory authority concerned hast to relate to the question whether there is an infringement of the GDPR, or whether the envisaged action complies with the GDPR. This includes objections relating to the absence or inadequacy of analysis in the lead supervisory authority's draft decision (i.e. issues with the scope of the investigation), which makes it impossible to properly assess whether the GDPR was infringed. [ 227 ] In order to limit objections by other supervisory authorities, [ 228 ] Article 4(24) GDPR introduces a threshold to such objections being \u2018relevant\u2019 and \u2018reasoned\u2019. An objection being relevant if it could lead to a different conclusion regarding the existence of an infringement or the envisaged action. [ 229 ] An objection can be considered reasoned if it clarifies why an amendment is proposed (i.e. what is wrong with the draft decision) and how an amendment would lead to a different conclusion. [ 230 ] They must also 'clearly demonstrate' the 'significant risks' posed by the draft decision, [ 231 ] either for the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects or the free flow of personal data within the Union. As a consequence, it is not enough for a concerned supervisory authority to just raise a concern that a draft decision by the lead supervisory authority is unlawful. For details on the cooperation mechanism see the commentary on Articles 60 and 65 GDPR. EDPB Guidelines : see EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 9/2020 on relevant and reasoned objection under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 9 March 2021 (Version 2.0) . For the definition on \u2018 information society service \u2019 the GDPR refers to Article 1(1)(b) of Directive (EU) 2015/1535 . The classification as information society service becomes relevant in several contexts of the GDPR, such as children\u2019s consent (see Article 8(1) GDPR ) or the right to object (see Article 21(5) GDPR ). \u2018At a distance\u2019 means that the service is provided without the parties being simultaneously present. [ 232 ] Thus, even when using electronic means, services provided within the physical presence of the recipient to the provider do not fall within this definition. [ 233 ] \u2018By electronic means\u2019 requires that the service is entirely sent and received via electronic equipment for the processing and storage of data, for example, through being transmitted by wire, radio, optical or other electromagnetic means. [ 234 ] While offline services are excluded from this definition, [ 235 ] composite services such as the selling of goods, advertising and gaming do qualify as such. [ 236 ] An \u2018individual request of a recipient of services\u2019 means that the service is provided through the transmission of data on individual request. [ 237 ] Services transmitting data to an unlimited number of individuals without their individual demand, such as radio broadcasting, television, and teletext are therefore not covered. [ 238 ] On the contrary, video-on-demand or pay-per-view services do qualify as information society services. [ 239 ] Accordingly, most online services encountered nowadays fulfill the criteria of an information society service. Typical example are: [ 240 ] Online legal or health services; Online libraries or newspapers; Online shopping and booking services; Online media-platforms or video games; Online search engines and web browsers. An \u2018international organisation\u2019 means any organisation or subordinate bodies of such, which are governed either by public international law or set up by an agreement between two or more countries. The classification as international organisation is relevant in terms of the additional rules placed on data transfers, according to Articles 44-50 GDPR . While the Data Protection Directive only regulated data flows to third party countries, the GDPR now extends the applicability of these rules to international organisations as as well. [ 241 ] For more information on the principles and additional safeguards placed on such transfers, please see the commentary on Articles 45-49 GDPR . While there is no universally accepted or further specified definition of the term coming from the GDPR, the overall definition from the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties from 1969, [ 242 ] serves as a source of inspiration for interpreting EU law according to the CJEU. [ 243 ] However, Article 2(1)(i) of the Convention defines international organisation as \u2018intergovernmental organisation\u2019, thereby failing to deliver a more specific definition. Moreover, since both options to reach an international organization, either through public international law or multilateral agreements, are not further delineated by the GDPR, a broad and flexible approach to the term is suggested. [ 244 ] In this regard, most organizations, such as the United Nations (UN), the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the World Trade Organization (WTO) as well as Interpol and Europol shall fall under the term. [ 245 ] However, these examples are not exhaustive and can be infinitely extended to other Internationals Organizations. Only NGOs, which are usually non-governmental organisations established as private initiatives and governed by domestic member state law, may not qualify as such.

Law Enforcement 3.3 Cooperation and Exchange of Knowledge 3.1 General Aspects 3.2 Law Enforcement 3.3 Cooperation and Exchange of Knowledge 4 Decisions 5 References In relation to third countries and international organisations, the Commission and supervisory authorities shall take appropriate steps to: (a)   develop international cooperation mechanisms to facilitate the effective enforcement of legislation for the protection of personal data; (b)   provide international mutual assistance in the enforcement of legislation for the protection of personal data, including through notification, complaint referral, investigative assistance and information exchange, subject to appropriate safeguards for the protection of personal data and other fundamental rights and freedoms; (c)   engage relevant stakeholders in discussion and activities aimed at furthering international cooperation in the enforcement of legislation for the protection of personal data; (d)   promote the exchange and documentation of personal data protection legislation and practice, including on jurisdictional conflicts with third countries. Article 50 GDPR aims to promote cooperation between the European Commission (Commission) and data protection authorities (DPAs), either from the EU or third countries, for both law enforcement purposes as well as for the exchange of knowledge between them. This way, Article 50 GDPR expands the exhortation under Article 57(1)(g) GDPR that calls for cooperation between EU DPAs, across borders. This provision has a precedence for the practical application of the OECD Recommendation on Cross-border Co-operation in the Enforcement of Laws Protecting Privacy OECD Recommendation), [ 1 ] promoted by the Canadian DPA, that was followed by the subsequent creation of the Global Privacy Enforcement Network (a network of worldwide data protection regulators that cooperate across borders to enforce data protection and privacy laws). This OECD Recommendation establishes a series of objectives that are similar to the ones laid out by Article 50 GDPR. Article 50 GDPR is divided in two different parts: letters (a) and (b) aim for cooperation with other authorities in law enforcement and necessary related activities, while letters (c) and (d) are meant for the exchange of knowledge, information, and general cooperation. As Kuner remarks, Article 50 GDPR will be of special importance in light of Brexit, as undoubtedly new mechanisms for cooperation between the British DPA and UE DPAs will be needed. [ 2 ] This has already proven necessary in cases such as the one framed in a proceeding from the Spanish DPA regarding a controller established in the UK. The Spanish DPA was unable to settle a case after the British DPA, following Brexit, left the Internal Market Information System aimed to be used by EU authorities for cooperation. [ 3 ] Article 50(a) and (b) GDPR seek to bolster cooperation to facilitate data protection and privacy law enforcement. This is done via the creation of international cooperation mechanisms, and through the provision of assistance in the enforcement of such legislation, which includes notification, complaint referral, investigative assistance and information exchange. This shall be done with special attention to human rights, and therefore adequate measures to protect them must be implemented. [ 4 ] Some of these mechanisms are further developed and used in practice by the Global Privacy Enforcement Network following the OECD Recommendation, and Articles 13 to 17 from Convention 108 [ 5 ] and its 181 Protocol regarding supervisory authorities and transborder data flows. [ 6 ] Obligations deriving from Article 50(c) and (d) GDPR, encourage discussion and related activities aimed at furthering international cooperation in the enforcement of legislation for the protection of personal data, and encourage the exchange and documentation of personal data protection legislation and practice, including jurisdictional conflicts with third countries. Both practices seek the final aim of helping enforce data protection and privacy law internationally. Although they do not address this as directly as the previous paragraphs, increased coordination between different authorities, and a better understanding of the law in different jurisdictions will undoubtedly lead to more effective cooperation on law enforcing. This cooperation has been happening for decades. Apart from the Global Privacy Enforcement Network, actors such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) also play a role in international cooperation. [ 7 ] For instance, together with the Article 29 Working Party (WP29), they have issued a referential to facilitate the use of binding corporate rules between the two organizations.

Each Member State shall provide for one or more independent public authorities to be responsible for monitoring the application of this Regulation, in order to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in relation to processing and to facilitate the free flow of personal data within the Union (\u2018supervisory authority\u2019). 2.   Each supervisory authority shall contribute to the consistent application of this Regulation throughout the Union. For that purpose, the supervisory authorities shall cooperate with each other and the Commission in accordance with Chapter VII. 3.   Where more than one supervisory authority is established in a Member State, that Member State shall designate the supervisory authority which is to represent those authorities in the Board and shall set out the mechanism to ensure compliance by the other authorities with the rules relating to the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63. 4.   Each Member State shall notify to the Commission the provisions of its law which it adopts pursuant to this Chapter, by 25 May 2018 and, without delay, any subsequent amendment affecting them. This provisions opens Chapter VI of the GDPR which is dedicated to supervisory authorities (\" SAs \"). SA is defined in Article 4(21) GDPR as an independent public authority which is established by a Member State pursuant to Article 51 GDPR. Chapter VI is divided into two sections. The former regulates SAs' establishment (Articles 51-54 GDPR), staffing and other organisational requirements that the Member State must enforce to ensure their independent and proper functioning. While the latter defines the competences, tasks, and powers of SAs (Articles 55-59 GDPR). The GDPR provides for exceptions from provisions entailed in Chapter VI (independent supervisory authorities). Article 85(2) GDPR mandates Member States to, among others, provide for exemptions or derogations from Chapter VI (independent supervisory authorities) where processing is carried out for journalistic purposes or the purpose of academic, artistic or literary expression, where necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with the freedom of expression and information. Also, the SA's competence does cover the processing of personal data where courts are acting in their judicial capacity (see Article 55(3) GDPR ). Article 51 GDPR is the fundamental article governing the establishment of SAs and their duties, providing a basis upon which other provisions build upon. The following articles provide for more detailed rules. Therefore, Article 51 GDPR and the related articles provide the institutional framework for the enforcement of the data protection rules, one of the main objectives of the GDPR. [ 1 ] As noted in Recital 117 the effective and independent functioning of SAs constitutes an essential element of a data subject's fundamental right to data protection. Therefore, SAs have a wide range of tasks (see Article 57 GDPR ) as well as extensive competencies (see Article 58 GDPR ), which they should use in a preventive manner (e.g. by raising awareness or giving advice on processing operations) and retrospectively , after a violation of the GDPR took place (e.g. by handling complaints lodged by data subjects). [ 2 ] Article 51(1) GDPR provides for the general obligation of Member States to establish a SA. Article 51(2) GDPR aims to provide for the consistent application of the GDPR within the EU/EEA (\"Union\"), thereby obliging SAs  to cooperate with each other and the Commission (see cooperation and consistency mechanism in Chapter VII ). Article 51(3) GDPR entails a special provision in case a Member State established more than one SA; in that case, only one SA can be part of the EDPB. Finally, Article 51(4) GDPR imposes an obligation on the Member States to notify the Commission about the national provisions setting up the national SA(s). Article 51 GDPR has to be read in conjunction with Article 4(21) (definition of SA), as well as with Article 52 (independence), Article 53 (General conditions for the members of SA), Article 54 (Rules on the establishment of SA), Articles 55 - 59 (Competence, tasks and powers), Articles 60 - 62 (Cooperation), Articles 63 - 67 (Consistency), and Article 68 - 76 (European Data Protection Board). [ 3 ] Each Member State must appoint one or more supervisory authorities (SAs), which have to be independent public authorities and are responsible for monitoring the application of the GDPR with the aim of protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in relation to processing and to facilitate the free flow of personal data within the Union. This provision already gives a glimpse of the requirements (e.g. independence) and tasks (e.g. monitor the GDPR's application) of SAs which are stipulated in more detail in other provisions of Chapter VI. Regarding the possibility to establish more than one SA (e.g. for different geographical regions or different business sectors) [ 4 ] , see commentary on Article 51(3) GDPR below. This provision already mentions that the SA established by a Member State must be independent. This requirement is described in more detail in Article 52 GDPR . For comprehensive remarks on this requirement, see commentary on Article 52 GDPR . To put it briefly, the SAs independence is already required in Article 8(3) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (\" CFR \"), as well as Article 16(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\" TFEU \"). By definition, SAs must be public bodies (see Article 4(21) GDPR ). Member States cannot outsource the enforcement of the GDPR to private entities. [ 5 ] A SA's main task is to monitor the correct application of the GDPR. This aim should be understood in line with the wording used by Article 16(2) TFEU and Article 8(3) CFR , which provides that the enforcement of the GDPR itself is something that must be managed by \" an independent authority .\" \"Data protection authorities are given a legal mandate in this regard, as set forth in article 51(1) GDPR, which is to monitor the application of the GDPR in order to  protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in relation to processing and to facilitate the free flow of personal data within the Union.\" EDPB, \u2018Opinion 5/2019 on the interplay between the ePrivacy Directive and the GDPR, in particular regarding the competence, tasks and powers of data protection authorities\u2019, 12 March 2019, margin number 53. Article 51(1) GDPR specifies that the role of SAs is twofold. [ 6 ] The first element is the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals, and the second is to facilitate the free flow of personal data within the Union. The SA is directly tasked with the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. The SAs' structure, tasks and powers are supposed to serve this purpose. [ 7 ] When monitoring and enforcing the GDPR, SAs must not only take into account the fundamental rights to privacy and data protection, but also other fundamental rights and freedoms, given that the right to data protection is not an absolute right. For instance, the fundamental rights to data protection (Article 8 CFR) and privacy (Article 7 CFR) must be weighed up against the fundamental rights freedom of expression (Article 11 CFR) and right to property (Article 17 CFR). [ 8 ] Also, other laws and regulations are not outside of the SAs' jurisdiction, as to correctly apply the GDPR, SA's must regularly determine provisions of the GDPR while taking into account other laws. One area where this is especially relevant is the interplay between the ePrivacy Directive and the GDPR. [ 9 ] For example: A SA must determine the necessity of processing personal data under applicable tax laws. In this instance, record keeping requirements under other laws become applicable for the purposes of Article 5(1)(e) GDPR when determining the duration for which data must be stored. Any such laws would also be relevant for determining whether the processing is necessary for complying with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject, under Article 6(1)(c) GDPR . At this point it is worth reminding that only the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data falls in the scope of the GDPR (see Article 1 GDPR ). The protection of a legal person's data is therefore not covered by this provision. [ 10 ] In line with the general objectives of the GDPR, as outlined in Article 1 GDPR , [ 11 ] SAs are also required to take into account the requirements of the free flow of personal data within the Union. However, SAs are not supposed to directly facilitate the free flow of personal data in the sense that they are responsible to take action against any barrier of that free flow. Rather, SAs indirectly facilitate the free flow of personal data within the Union by ensuring a high level of data protection in the Union as a prerequisite for such transfer. [ 12 ] According to some Commentators, the dual objectives mean that the SA must take into account the various interests of data subjects and data processors and strike a fair balance between them. [ 13 ] Paragraph 2 of this provision addresses the consistent application of the GDPR thorough the Union and obliges the SAs to cooperate with each other and with the Commission. Detailed provisions regarding this cooperation can be found in Chapter 7  GDPR where a cooperation and consistency mechanism is described. In contrast to the other provisions in this Article, this paragraph generally needs no specific implementation by each Member State. [ 14 ] The use of the imperative \" shall \" imposes a positive legal obligation upon SAs to facilitate the consistent application of the GDPR throughout the EU/EEA. This has to be read in conjunction with each SA's obligation to ensure GDPR compliance on its respective territory. [ 15 ] The use of the verb \u201c contribute \u201d denotes a form of proactive participation specifically aimed at the \u201c consistent monitoring and enforcement of this Regulation \u201d and, according to Recital 135, the uniform application of the law. Accordingly, SAs are required to identify any problems and act for their prompt resolution. For example, prompt action for resolution could be necessary in case of inactivity of a SA or lead supervisory authority in cross-border cases, where cooperation and assistance between SAs is required. The use of the term \" consistent application \" mandates that the application and interpretation of GDPR provisions should not differ between Member States' respective SAs, as well as where applicable, between the multiple SAs within a Member State (for further analysis on this point, see Article 51(3) GDPR below). All SAs should have the same understanding of GDPR provisions and interpret and enforce the law in the same vein. The GDPR's predecessor, Directive 95/46/EC ( \"DPD\" ), was criticised for its fragmented enforcement of the right to data protection, which differed significantly from Member State to Member States, this was something that the GDPR sought to remedy by legislating for the consistent application of its provisions. [ 16 ] Under the DPD, there was limited cooperation between supervisory authorities, this too was something that the GDPR sought to remedy. [ 17 ] Article 51(2) GDPR provides that SAs must cooperate with each other and the Commission and references to Chapter VII of the GDPR. Cooperation is an essential element of SAs' obligations under the GDPR, it is seen as the primary tool for enabling the GDPR's consistent application. Cooperation is a notion which is embedded in the foundations of Union law, through Article 4(3) of the Treaty on the European Union (\" TEU \"), which imposes a general duty of sincere co-operation. Chapter VII provides rules on cooperation between SAs in cross-border cases, as well as for their participation in the consistency mechanism and the European Data Protection Board, affording SAs responsibilities on a national and European level. For detailed information on this mechanism see commentary on Article 60 GDPR et seqq. The cooperation between SAs is based directly on the GDPR and no specific agreement or treaty between Member states is necessary. [ 18 ] When cooperation takes place with other 'independent' SAs, no conflict arises under treaty law for the purposes of Article\u00a08(3)\u00a0CFR and Article\u00a016(2)\u00a0TFEU. However, tensions may arise with the concept of 'independence' when SAs must cooperate with the European Commission, as the Commission is a political body. Consequently, cooperation with the Commission may undermine the independence demanded of SAs, as Article 8(3) CFR and Article\u00a016(2) TFEU require complete independence. For the purposes of Article 51 GDPR, it is sufficient if a Member State provides for only one SA. However, several SAs may co-exist in the same Member State in accordance with Article 51(3) GDPR. Article 51(3) GDPR is particularly relevant for Member States with a federal constitutional structure. Germany, for example, consists of 16 Federal States (\u201c Bundesl\u00e4nder \u201d) each with its own SA. Currently the German SAs are represented by the German Federal SA (\"BfDI\"). [ 19 ] Similarly, Spain appoints separate SAs for Catalonia and the Basque Country. [ 20 ] States may appoint multiple SAs in respect of their territorial division of competences or sectorial division of competences. [ 21 ] For instance, a State may choose to appoint an SA responsible for controllers from the private sector and another for controllers from the public sector. Additionally, based on derogations concerning processing of data for journalistic purposes or the purpose of artistic and literary expression under Article 85(2) GDPR ,  some German states have established separate SAs for broadcasting companies. Furthermore, Article 91(2) GDPR allows for the establishment of separate SAs for religious groups. This provision has also been relied upon in Germany, where SAs are partly incorporated within the Catholic and Protestant churches. [ 22 ] Pursuant to Article 51(3) GDPR, Member States with several SAs must firstly designate which of these authorities represents the Member State in the EDPB, [ 23 ] and secondly, should by law establish mechanisms for ensuring the effective participation of its SAs in the consistency mechanism. Member States with multiple SAs should designate which one is to function as representative, responsible for functioning as the contact point for other Member States' SAs, the Board and the Commission. [ 24 ] Member States are obligated to notify the Commission of the provisions of its law which it adopts pursuant to Chapter VI GDPR (i.e. the measures adopted regarding the establishment of their SAs and of any subsequent changes to these measures). Such a notification by the member states was necessary by 25 May 2018. Any subsequent amendments are also subject to such notification to the Commission. The duty to notify is of significance as non-compliance with GDPR requirements may give rise to the infringement procedure under Article 258 TFEU . In the past infringement procedures before the CJEU were successfully brought by the Commission against Germany, Austria and Hungary with regard to the independence requirement. A possible consequence in case of a violation against this provision is the law's inapplicability.

Each supervisory authority shall act with complete independence in performing its tasks and exercising its powers in accordance with this Regulation. 2.   The member or members of each supervisory authority shall, in the performance of their tasks and exercise of their powers in accordance with this Regulation, remain free from external influence, whether direct or indirect, and shall neither seek nor take instructions from anybody. 3.   Member or members of each supervisory authority shall refrain from any action incompatible with their duties and shall not, during their term of office, engage in any incompatible occupation, whether gainful or not. 4.   Each Member State shall ensure that each supervisory authority is provided with the human, technical and financial resources, premises and infrastructure necessary for the effective performance of its tasks and exercise of its powers, including those to be carried out in the context of mutual assistance, cooperation and participation in the Board. 5.   Each Member State shall ensure that each supervisory authority chooses and has its own staff which shall be subject to the exclusive direction of the member or members of the supervisory authority concerned. 6.   Each Member State shall ensure that each supervisory authority is subject to financial control which does not affect its independence and that it has separate, public annual budgets, which may be part of the overall state or national budget. Primary Union law necessitates the independence of supervisory authorities under Article 8(3) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (\" CFR \"), Article 16(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\" TFEU \") and Article 39 of the Treaty on the European Union (\" TEU \"). These Articles provide that Member States must ensure that compliance with data protection rules are be subject to the \" control of independent authorities .\" Article 52 GDPR gives effect to this requirement. Article 52 GDPR codifies the concept of \" complete independence \" developed by the European Court of Justice (\" CJEU \") in several landmark cases concerning the interpretation of Article 28(1) of Directive 95/46/EC ( \"DPD\" ), the Regulation's predecessor. [ 1 ] Article 28(1) DPD established the existence of supervisory authorities and mandated that they were to \" act with complete independence in exercising the functions entrusted to them .\" Similarly, Article 52(1) GDPR explicitly demands that the independence of SAs must be complete. It has elaborated this to mean that the authority and its members must exercise their functions without any external influence and without conflicts of interest (Article\u00a052(2)(3)\u00a0GDPR). In order to make these principles operational, the provision requires Member States to provide the SA with adequate financial and organisational means for this purpose (Article 52(4)(5)(6) GDPR). Elements of SAs' complete independence are also addressed in Article 53 GDPR and Article 54 GDPR . The CJEU in the Case of Commission v Germany , notes that the notion of absolute independence for SAs was developed in order to strengthen the protection of individuals, not for the purpose of granting special status to SAs. [ 2 ] Moreover, this understanding was affirmed in Commission v Austria , wherein the CJEU held that \u201c the guarantee of the independence of national supervisory authorities is intended to ensure the effectiveness and reliability of the supervision of compliance with the provisions on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data [...] . \u201d [ 3 ] The notion independence reoccurs throughout the regulation. For instance, the principle of independence is also referred to in Article 4(12) GDPR (definition of SA), Article 45(2)(b) GDPR (personal data transfers to a third country or an international organisation outside of the outside of the European Economic Area), and Article 69 GDPR (on the independence of the European Data Protection Board (\" EDPB \")). [ 4 ] Article 52(1) GDPR acts as a catch-all clause that applies as a general standard, [ 5 ] regardless if more specific provisions of the GDPR do not apply. Member States can establish one or several SAs for monitoring the implementation of the GDPR ( Article 51 GDPR ). Article\u00a052(1)\u00a0GDPR clarifies that \"each\" of them must (\"shall\") act with complete independence. [ 6 ] This condition mandates that Member States, SAs and each of their members ensure that the the requirement of complete independence is fulfilled. In the event that the provision is not implemented, the Commission may start infringement proceedings against the state under Article 258 TFEU. In addition, other Member States may bring an action before the CJEU under Article\u00a0259\u00a0TFEU. Infringement proceedings against Member States have occurred before. In three separate cases instigated by the Commission, the CJEU found that Germany, Austria, and Hungary had not fulfilled their obligations, as they had failed to ensure the complete independence of their SAs. [ 7 ] In Commission v Germany the Court specified that the notion of \u201c complete independence \u201d must be given a broad and autonomous interpretation. Other provisions on the independence of SAs and the European Data Protection Supervisor (\" EDPS \") are to be interpreted homogenously, as they are based on the same general principle of independence. [ 8 ] Complete independence requires that the decisions of SAs and SAs themselves, are objective and impartial and remain above any suspicion of partiality. [ 9 ] To fulfil the requirement of complete independence, SAs must remain free from any external influence, which is liable to have an effect on their decisions. [ 10 ] According to the CJEU, this freedom is necessary for SAs to carry out their functions, which include \"ensuring a fair balance between fundamental rights, on the one hand, observance of the fundamental right to private life and, on the other hand, the interests requiring free movement of personal data .\u201d [ 11 ] Consequently, an SA must enjoy independence in all possible forms, including: institutional and organizational independence (see below); independence in decision making, without any external influence (see Article 52(2) GDPR, below): functional independence (see Article 52(3) GDPR, below); operational independence, such as having own premises and staff (see Article 52(4)(5) GDPR, below); financial and budgetary independence (see Article 52(4)(6) GDPR, below), and restrictions regarding premature termination of mandate of SA members (see Article 53 GDPR). These requirements mean that SAs must be independent with respect to the entities, controllers or processors, over which they are required to exercise control. The concept of independence applies also to the state or any other entity that may exercise any kind of direct or indirect influence over the decision-making capacity of an SA. For example, in practice, this requirement mandates that legislative or executive bodies, such as the government of a Member State or the Commission, cannot change or replace a decision taken by a SA. Moreover, the concept of complete independence extends to SA member's term of office, which cannot end prematurely outside of the GDPR's parameters, even if Member States introduce domestic laws which attempt to restructure the functioning of SAs. [ 12 ] The independence of SAs extends to adequacy decisions adopted by the Commission. An SA is not bound by an adequacy decision adopted by the Commission under Article 45 GDPR , if it considers it to not comply with the GDPR's requirements. For instance, in Schrems I, the CJEU made it clear that the competent SA when examining a data subject's claim relating to the third-country transfer of data \"must be able to examine, with complete independence, whether the transfer of that data complies with the requirements laid down by the [law].\" [ 13 ] The aim of such complete independence is to ensure that SAs are free from political influence. For this reason, the CJEU has highlighted that their governance must remain outside of a State's \"classic hierarchical administration. \u201d [ 14 ] The requirement of independence does not jeopardise their democratic legitimation, as an SAs' democratic legitimacy stems from the appointment of their members, which is to be done by means of a transparent procedure by a Member State's parliament, government, head of State, or an independent body entrusted with the appointment under Member State law ( Article 53 GDPR ). SAs are also accountable to the political bodies of their Member States. Nevertheless, complete independence should not be taken to mean unaccountability. [ 15 ] Pursuant to Article\u00a059\u00a0GDPR, they must provide annual reports to the national parliament, the government and any other authorities as designated by member state law. Moreover, in line with the rule of law, decisions of SAs are subject to judicial review, under Article 78 GDPR. Among the tasks of each SA is handling of complaints of data subjects and cooperation with other SAs under the Article\u00a063\u00a0GDPR consistency mechanism. The tasks of SAs are laid down in Article 57 GDPR . [ 16 ] The powers of SAs are both investigative and corrective, which are set out in Article 58 GDPR . [ 17 ] The fact that SAs' legally binding decisions are subject to full judicial review (see commentary on Article 78 GDPR ) does not diminish the SAs' independence: \"[\u2026] it is true that, in accordance with Article 8(3) of the Charter, compliance with the rules on the protection of personal data is subject to control by an independent authority. In that context, Article 52 of the GDPR specifies, in particular, that each supervisory authority is to act with complete independence in performing its tasks and exercising its powers in accordance with that regulation [\u2026]. However, those guarantees of independence are in no way compromised by the fact that the legally binding decisions of a supervisory authority are subject to full judicial review.\" CJEU - Joined Cases C\u201126/22 and C\u201164/22 - SCHUFA , margin number 64 et seq.. Article 52(2) GDPR requires two things from members of SAs in the performance of their duties. Firstly, it requires them to remain free from external influences, whether direct or indirect, and secondly, it prohibits them from seeking or taking instructions from anyone. As the guardians of the right to data privacy, SAs must be able to act objectively and impartially, free from any external influence that might affect their decision-making process. In particular, this prohibition is primarily targetted towards undue governmental and political influence. [ 18 ] Case law : In Commission v Germany , CJEU considered that a government may, among others, tend to favour economic interests in the application of data protection provisions by certain establishments which are economically significant for their state or a region. [ 19 ] The Court decided that the requirement of independence was not met, as SAs competences over the private sector were subject to governmental supervision and state scrutiny, which allowed the government to directly and indirectly influence the decisions of Germany's SAs. [ 20 ] In Commission v Austria , the CJEU among others held that the fact that the office of SAs was composed of officials of the Federal Chancellery (Office of the Head of Austrian Government), which was itself subject to supervision by the Austrian SA, carried a risk of influence over SA\u2019s decisions and prevented it from being above all suspicion of partiality and therefore incompatible with the requirement of independence. [ 21 ] Members of SAs are the carriers of the principle of independence of SAs. Members are the lead personnel appointed in accordance with Article 53(1) GDPR . [ 22 ] In addition to at least one member, every SA also has staff. The concept of independence does not apply to staff. They must follow instructions of members of the SAs but must remain independent from any influence from outside of the SA (see Article 52(4) GDPR section below). [ 23 ] The prohibition under Article 52(2) GDPR is broad and forbids any form of direct influence. Forms of direct influence are more explicit that indirect influence, and could include instructions given to an SA on any aspect of its work, direct political influence, or prior compliance. [ 24 ] These examples are non-exhaustive. In practice, this prohibition forbids situations such as the following: Example : The government cannot review a decision of an SA for its correct interpretation and application of the GDPR and replace it. Example : The Commission cannot instruct an SA as to which company should or should not be investigated. Example : An SA will not decide to impose a fine for the repeated violation of the GDPR, as they are aware that their state's ministry as the scrutinising authority, will annul and replace their decision because the government does not want to impose any fines for political reasons. Indirect influence is implicit, and occurs in instances where an SA\u2019s actions or decisions are swayed by external factors. CJEU case law suggests that the mere suspicion of partiality is sufficient to constitute an infringement upon an SA's independence. In the Court\u2019s view, this risk may generate a form of \u2018prior compliance\u2019 which is incompatible with the free and independent exercise of an SA's functions. Indirect influence equally may result from external control over an SA member's career prospects, including external control over disciplinary action, especially in circumstances where political incentives exist for the GDPR's non-enforcement. Case law : In Commission v Germany , the CJEU explained that \u201c the mere risk that the state scrutinizing authorities could exercise political powers over the decisions of SAs is enough to hinder the latter in the independent performance of their tasks. First, as was stated by the Commission, there could be \u2018prior compliance\u2019 on the part of those authorities in the light of the scrutinising authority\u2019s decision-making practice. Secondly, for the purposes of the role adopted by those authorities as guardians of the right to private life, it is necessary that their decisions, and therefore the authorities themselves, remain above any suspicion of partiality. \u201d [ 25 ] Case law : In Commission v Austria , the CJEU held that the fact that the Federal Chancellor had an unconditional right to be informed on all aspects of the work of the SA was enough to subject the SA to indirect influence from the Federal Chancellor. The Court also noted that the professional evaluation of an SA member by their hierarchical superior for the purposes of a promotion had the capacity to constitute a form of prior compliance. [ 26 ] Case law : Similarly, in Commission v Hungary , the CJEU clarified that an SA member's risk of premature termination from their term of office could lead them to enter into a form of prior compliance with the political authority in question. The mere risk of prior compliance was incompatible with the requirement of independence. [ 27 ] Given these conditions, the question arises as to what should be the scale of national legislative intervention to ensure effective independence during SA members' term of office. The problem is particularly pressing where certain professional categories are concerned, such as legal advisors in the private sector. In instances such as these, a form of prior compliance can be envisaged, not so much with respect to political or governmental bodies, but rather with respect to positions taken previously, or to the risk that certain \u2018unpopular\u2019 decisions may reduce the number of job opportunities after the end of members' term. Included in the wording of Article 52(2) GDPR, is an explicit prohibition on SAs from seeking or taking instructions from anybody. The CJEU has clarified, that freedom from external interference is an essential element of the principle of independence. Case law : In Commission v Hungary , CJEU held that \u201c [t]he operational independence of supervisory authorities, in that their members are not bound by instructions of any kind in the performance of their duties, is thus an essential condition that must be met if those authorities are to satisfy the criterion of independence. \u201d [ 28 ] Under Article 52(3) GDPR, members of each SA during their term of office, are forbidden from engaging in any incompatible actions or occupations with their duties, whether gainful or not. The purpose of this provision is to protect the independence of SAs, as well as to ensure the lawfulness of their actions and to ensure the maintenance of their reputation. [ 29 ] The GDPR provides no list of actions or occupations that are considered \" incompatible\" , as under Article 54(1)(f) GDPR, Member States must regulate the matter through their national legislation. Recital 121 also confirms that Member States are to regulate for the general conditions of SA members, and in addition, this Recital necessitates that SA members act with integrity. Unlike the members of other supervisory bodies, such as the EDPS, members of SAs are permitted to hold other positions in addition to those with the SA, so long as these do not conflict with their duties under the GDPR. This freedom allows members of SAs to hold other competences. For example, in Germany on a federal level and in some German individual federal states, as well as in Malta and Slovenia, SAs are the public authority in charge of freedom of information legislation. The prohibition of incompatible actions applies both to SA members' professional and private life. As noted above, the concept incompatibility is left to Member States to define. Nonetheless, examples of actions which would be considered incompatible with the function of an SA member are those which risk giving rise to external influence or partiality. For example, the receipt of gifts, promises or any other form of benefit is certainly incompatible. In addition, SA members should avoid frequent private contact with potential counterparties or representatives of controllers or processors to the extent possible, and in the least should avoid contact with those against whom investigations are being conducted. Regarding the concept of \" incompatible occupation,\" the wording of Article 52(3) GDPR makes no differentiation to the nature of the occupation. It makes no difference for the purpose of the provision whether these are professional, part-time, or voluntary. The decisive factor is the occupation's incompatibility. This prohibition aims to curb against external occupational activities of SA members which have the potential to undermine the body's independence and neutrality. The concept of incompatibility is to be judged on a prognostic scale. Therefore, an occupation will be deemed incompatible if it has the potential to lead to undue influence or conflicts of interest with an SA's independent exercise of office, regardless of whether these are economic or political and so forth. The mere risk of incompatibility is sufficient to fall under the Article's prohibition. Typically, incompatible conduct would be, for example, accepting a position within a company whose actions are liable to scrutiny by the DPA, or the provision of legal advice within the SA\u2019s own jurisdiction. However, even in circumstances such as these, each case must be examined to determine whether a conflict of interest arises.  For instance, if an SA member were to take on an additional role as as a tax consultant or lawyer in their individual capacity, the potential risk of conflict with supervisory tasks would have to be assessed, as in principle, such activities are not inherently incompatible with the office. [ 30 ] Article 52(4) GDPR and Article 52(6) GDPR establish the framework for SAs financial governance. Article 52(4) GDPR stipulates that SAs must enjoy material independence. To be able to efficiently carry out their tasks, SAs must receive the necessary financial, organisational, technical and human resources to fulfil their multiple obligations under the GDPR.  Included in SAs' material independence is autonomy in relation to the distribution of resources within the allocated budget. [ 31 ] \u201c[\u2026] Member States are obliged, under Article 52(4) of the GDPR, to ensure that each supervisory authority is provided with the human, technical and financial resources, premises and infrastructure necessary for the effective performance of its tasks and exercise of its powers. It follows that those resources must be adapted to the use that data subjects make of their right to make complaints to the supervisory authorities. Thus, it is incumbent on the Member States to provide the supervisory authorities with the appropriate resources to process all complaints submitted to them, if necessary by increasing those resources in the light of the use made by data subjects of their right to lodge complaints under Article 77(1) of the GDPR. A supervisory authority cannot, therefore, base an argument, in order to refuse to act on a complaint pursuant to Article 57(4) of that regulation, on the fact that a person who lodges a significantly greater number of complaints than the average number of complaints lodged by each data subject significantly mobilises the resources of that authority to the detriment of the handling of other complaints submitted by other persons.\" CJEU - C\u2011416/23 - \u00d6sterreichische Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rde , margin number 51 et seq. This provision attempts to ensure that SAs' independent functioning and effective performance is not compromised by inadequate staffing and financial resources. [ 32 ] The powers granted to SAs under the GDPR are hollow if an authority is unable to carry out its tasks, or can only do so ineffectively, because it lacks the necessary resources. [ 33 ] For this reason, the adequacy of resources should be periodically reviewed. [ 34 ] Human resources refer to the necessary number of staff and to the availability of qualified personnel to carry out the tasks and exercise of powers. This provision requires that SAs have employees with a training background in the fields of law and computer science, including communication technology. To do so, the applicable salary structures of SAs must be designed in such a way to ensure that high-quality employees can be recruited in competition with the private sector. [ 35 ] The structure of staff should enable SAs to take prompt and effective action. [ 36 ] Technical resources refer to the availability of appropriate hardware and software equipment to SAs, in order for them to be able to carry out their monitoring tasks. [ 37 ] Financial resources consist of the funding needed for the effective functioning of SAs, as well as resources for unforeseen tasks. According to Article 52(6) GDPR each SA must have its own budget (see below). Sufficient financial resources must be provided an SA's basic running costs, such as for the necessary human and technical resources, the premises, and the infrastructure. Included in the financial resources, for example, could be funds for travel expenses, participation in further education and training, the implementation of conferences and workshops, obtaining external legal expertise, legal representation, or for the short-term reinforcement of staff coverage in the event of special workload. [ 38 ] Sufficient financial resources are crucial to the impartiality of SAs. Otherwise, there is a risk that SAs may be more lenient in the enforcement of the GDPR and may refrain from imposing heavy fines to avoid their decisions being challenged. Especially, if they do not have the necessary financial resources to defend their decision in the event of an appeal in court. [ 39 ] Other essential elements for the proper functioning of the SA are the premises and the infrastructure. The SA should be equipped with premises with adequate space to ensure the permanence of its members and the confidentiality of meetings. Communication and security infrastructures commensurate with the sensitivity of the task are obviously needed. [ 40 ] Article 52(4) GDPR explicitly relates the criteria of sufficient resources to the effective performance of an SA's tasks and exercise of its powers. The provision does not specify what minimum threshold of resource allocation is \" sufficient \" for the purposes of the GDPR. However, what is considered sufficient is likely to differ significantly from SA to SA, as this depends on varying factors, such as the size of the territory and number of subjects within it, the number of complaints it receives, and the complexity of those complaints. Another significant factor is the size of companies and their respective processing operations within an SA's territory. Naturally, larger technology companies are more complex and time consuming to monitor than smaller businesses. Effective performance refers to the efficient functioning of an SA, in both the fulfilment of its tasks and the exercise of its powers. In practice, the notion of effective performance suggests that the majority of GDPR violations are identified, investigated and sanctioned. In general, the likelihood of severe sanctioning against infringements is a crucial element of ensuring voluntary compliance with the law. Nonetheless, the concept of effective sanctioning remains far from the current reality where most GDPR violations are not addressed, mass violations are tolerated and complaints in most states take several years to be decided. [ 41 ] Finally, Member States must provide sufficient resources not only for SAs on national level, but also on a European level. Member States must additionally provide sufficient resources for activities carried out \u201cin the context of mutual assistance, cooperation and participation in the Board.\u201d These activities relate to SAs' participation in the cooperation and consistency mechanism under Chapter 7 of the GDPR, and include staff attendance of EDPB meetings and cooperation with other SAs under the consistency mechanism (one-stop shop). In short, SAs must be provided with the sufficient technical and financial resources to cooperate with other authorities. An SA should therefore have at its disposal, for example, translators for when collegial work requires the translation of documents or the interaction with colleagues of a different language, encrypted communication systems to maintain the secrecy of the investigations and, more generally, the adequate financial resources for the instigation of joint investigations. [ 42 ] The independence and efficiency of SAs may be compromised if its staff is chosen by another body or employed elsewhere. Unsuitable and incompetent staff cannot efficiently monitor the application of the GDPR. Therefore, Article 52(5) GDPR specifies that each SA must be able to choose and employ its own staff, who must then be subject to the exclusive direction of the SA. [ 43 ] An SAs' ability to choose and have its own staff enables SAs to employ suitable staff with the expertise, experience, qualifications and skills required to perform their tasks. [ 44 ] Each SA must select its own staff. Taking into account Recital 121, this requirement can be met not only if the SA recruits and selects the staff itself, but also if the selection of staff is carried out by an independent body. [ 45 ] Autonomy and independence in the selection of staff gives SA an opportunity to better respond to its existing professional and staffing needs. [ 46 ] Case law : In Commission v Austria , the CJEU decided among others that Austria did not fulfil the conditions of independence because the SA's office was integrated within the department of the Federal Chancellery composed of officials of the Federal Chancellery. [ 47 ] Staff of an SA are subject to the exclusive supervision and direction of the member(s) of the SA, as any supervision or directions by another body could influence the work of the staff and thus the work of the SA. This requirement also excludes the possibility of staff working for the SA, having any organisational links or being subject to the supervision of any other body. [ 48 ] Article 52(6) GDPR addresses a crucial aspect of SAs' financial independence, their freedom from financial oversight which has the capacity to affect their independence. Moreover, this provision necessitates that SAs have their own separate, public annual budgets. Naturally, the concept of independence does not suggest that SAs should not be subject to any financial oversight, Recital 118 GDPR provides that \" the independence of supervisory authorities should not mean that the supervisory authorities cannot be subject to control or monitoring mechanisms regarding their financial expenditure or to judicial review .\" Although, Article 52(6) GDPR should not be understood as obliging Member States to subject its SA(s) to financial controls, [ 49 ] the provision does clearly set limits on the scope of financial controls, as these cannot compromise the independence of SAs. They must only be used as a mechanism for accountability, and may not be implemented in a way that would impede an SA's functioning. Each SA must have a separate annual budget, which allows SAs a sense of financial autonomy. For the purposes of Article 52(6) GDPR, SAs must be able to independently determine the allocation of their funds. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 52 GDPR \u2191 Case C-518/07, Commisson v Germany ; Case C-614/10, Commission v Austria; and Case C-288/12, Commission v Hungary . \u2191 See CJEU, case C-518/07 - Commission v Germany , paragraph 25. \u2191 See CJEU, case C-614/10 - Commission v Austria, paragraph 25. \u2191 See Zerdick , in Kuner, Bygrave, Docksey, The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): A Commentary, Article 52 GDPR, p. 876 (Oxford University Press 2020). \u2191 Ziebarth, in Sydow, Marsch, DS-GVO/BDSG, Article 52 GDPR, margin number 6 (Nomos 2022). \u2191 Zerdick , in Kuner et al., The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Article 52 GDPR, p. 879 (Oxford University Press 2020). \u2191 See CJEU, case C-518/07 - Commission v Germany, case C-614/10 - Commission v Austria , and case C-288/12 - Commission v Hungary . \u2191 See CJEu, case C-518/07 - Commission v Germany , paragraphs 17-39 and 51 and paragraphs 26-28, available here .

Decisions 5 References Article 53 - General conditions for the members of the supervisory authority 1.   Member States shall provide for each member of their supervisory authorities to be appointed by means of a transparent procedure by: \u2014 their parliament; \u2014 their government; \u2014 their head of State; or \u2014 an independent body entrusted with the appointment under Member State law. 2.   Each member shall have the qualifications, experience and skills, in particular in the area of the protection of personal data, required to perform its duties and exercise its powers. 3.   The duties of a member shall end in the event of the expiry of the term of office, resignation or compulsory retirement, in accordance with the law of the Member State concerned. 4.   A member shall be dismissed only in cases of serious misconduct or if the member no longer fulfils the conditions required for the performance of the duties. Article 53 GDPR regulates the means of appointment for supervisory authority members (\" SA \"). The provision governs the qualities required to hold office, circumstances relating to the termination of office and the minimum conditions for removal in the event of misconduct. This Article partly integrates Articles 51 , 52 and 54 GDPR , and resultantly its paragraphs are made up of differing characteristics. For instance, some paragraphs are directly applicable as provisions of Union law, while others require legislative intervention by Member States. Given the specificities of Member States' varying constitutional and administrative rules, this provision allows Member States to determine the manner of SA members' appointment in line with their own national frameworks. [ 1 ] Pursuant to Article 54(1)(c) GDPR , the rules governing the appointment procedure must be legislated for by each Member State. The procedure regulating appointment must be transparent, irrespective of which public body makes the appointment. This requirement is rooted in the principle of public accountability, and aims to ensure that the public is able to scrutinise the appointment of SA members. [ 2 ] The GDPR does not clarify as to what qualifies as a transparent procedure. However, Commentators have noted that the minimum threshold for transparency, should be in the least, include making the details of the selection process available to the public. In addition, any such procedure should demonstrate that alternative candidates have been considered and evaluated in accordance with the criteria specified by the GDPR. [ 3 ] Example : Even if the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) is governed by Regulation 2018/1725, rather than by the GDPR,  the procedure for the appointment of its president can be considered a good example of a transparent procedure. To a certain degree, this procedure can be a source of inspiration for national SAs. In 2019 the selection process was structured in the following way: A public call for candidates for the Supervisor posts resulted in the most competent applicants being shortlisted by an inter-institutional selection board; Following interviews with the shortlisted candidates, the selection board presented the European Commission with their recommendations for its review and submission to the European Parliament and the Council. Hearings to evaluate the experiences, skills and independence of the candidates took place in the European Parliament. A joint decision\u00a0 of the Parliament and Council was reached following their deliberations. [ 4 ] Article 53(1) names four possible appointing bodies. These are a Member State's (i) parliament, (ii) government, (iii) head of state, or (iv) an independent body entrusted with the appointment under Member State law. If member(s) of the SA are appointed by either the (i) parliament, (ii) government, or (iii) head of state, the appointment should be made based on a proposal by any one of the aforementioned bodies. [ 5 ] While a joint appointment by different branches of state is not foreseen by the GDPR, [ 6 ] there is no reason to consider a joint appointment as contrary to Article 53(1) GDPR, so long as one of the bodies mentioned above is involved and can effectively determine the result of the final decision. Article 53(2) GDPR stipulates that each SA member must (\"shall\") have the qualifications, experience and skills in the area of personal data protection, required to perform its duties and exercise its powers. In addition to expertise in data protection law, in particularly IT and organisational expertise are of relevance for the work of SA members. [ 7 ] Also general requirements, such as general requirements foreseen for all employees of the national administration, can be prescribed for members. [ 8 ] Competence requirements must be provided by law pursuant to Article 54(1)(b) GDPR . These competence requirements serve two purposes. The first is to ensure the high quality of SAs' work, and consequently the effectiveness of data protection. The second is to act as a minimum barrier against appointments of a purely political nature, without adequate professional preparation. [ 9 ] However, Article 53(2) GDPR does not require Member States to test the knowledge of its SAs' members. Moreover, unlike the rules regulating the appointment of members of other institutions such as the Court of Justice and the General Court, [ 10 ] the GDPR does not require that members are to be chosen from individuals whose independence is absolute. [ 11 ] The qualification requirement refers to a member's educational background, such as the completion of vocational training, a course of study, or the acquisition of additional qualifications and further training certificates in relation to the activities of the SA. The qualification requirement is aimed at ensuring that a potential SA member is able to demonstrate that they have acquired the relevant theoretical knowledge for their position. [ 12 ] The experience requirement necessitates that an SA member must have previously applied what was learned through practical activity. [ 13 ] While the term \u201c skills \u201d concern the abilities of the applicants relevant to the position, these include both legal and non-legal skills, and it is irrelevant whether they are innate or acquired through experience. The criteria outlined by the GDPR for the appointment of SA members is directly related to ensuring that an SA is able to effectively perform the tasks and exercise the powers afforded to it under the GDPR. [ 14 ] These tasks and powers include handling complaints lodged by data subjects, conducting investigations on the application of the GDPR, and promoting public awareness of the risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data. [ 15 ] Consequently, an SA's effective functioning is based on the competence of its members, who cannot sufficiently fulfil their duties unless they have the relevant qualifications, experience and skills to do so. Article 53(3) GDPR regulates the ordinary coming to an end of the SA membership. It sets out three grounds for the ordinary termination of the mandate of a SA member. These are (i) expiry of term of office, (ii) resignation and (iii) compulsory retirement. Anything which falls outside of this exhaustive list cannot justify the end of a member's mandate, for instance the internal re-organisation of an SA. [ 16 ] The provision's aim of establishing an exhaustive list of grounds for the termination of a member's mandate is an attempt to safeguard the independence of SAs, by limiting the exposure of their members to undue political influence. [ 17 ] Case law : In Commission v Hungary , the CJEU held that while the Member States are entitled to restructure their data protection systems and SAs, such restructuring shall not result in a preliminary termination of the mandate of a SA member. Preliminary termination of the SA member\u2019s mandate would unjustifiably interfere with the independence of SAs. [ 18 ] Case law : The Garai case is also interesting in this regard. While it did not concern a SA, it regarded the early dismissal of the members of the national regulatory authority (NRA) for electronic communications in Spain. The CJEU concluded that the dismissal of the members before the end of their mandates due to the merging between different regulatory bodies was against the requirement of independence of the NRA in the 'absence of any rules guaranteeing that such dismissals do not jeopardise the independence and impartiality of such members'. [ 19 ] Members of SAs can, in addition, be legally employed by SAs. In such cases the conditions for the termination of the employment of members must be in line with the provisions of Article 53 GDPR. However, the rules governing the cessation of employment must be determined by member State's national law, in accordance with Article 54(1)(f) GDPR . Normally, the duties of a SA member end ' in the event of the expiry of the term of office '. The term of office is dealt with in Article 54(1) GDPR , under which Member States are obliged to legislate for through their national laws. The term in office of an SA member also expires in case of death. [ 20 ] SA members can voluntarily decide to end their mandate before the full completion of their term in office. It should be highlighted that resignation should be voluntary, and not influenced by external pressure. [ 21 ] Retirement can be a reason for the premature termination of an SA member's mandate af a SA member, especially in cases of retirement due to age or illness. [ 22 ] Rules regulating the retirement of SA members must be provided for through a Member State's national law before an SA member is nominated, in order to comply with the principle of independence. [ 23 ] Case law : The CJEU established in Commission v Hungary, that Member States cannot change the rules concerning SA Members' term in office during their term, as this could result in a form of prior compliance, undermining the requirement of independence. [ 24 ] Under Article 53(4) GDPR, an SA member can be dismissed only in two cases. The first of which is in the case of serious misconduct, and the second is if members can no longer fulfil the conditions required for the performance of the duties. These are the two extraordinary reasons for the premature termination of duties of SAs and should be interpreted restrictively. Notably, these grounds are exceptions to the ordinary grounds governing the end of a member's mandate under Article 53(3) GDPR, [ 25 ] as grounds for dismissal must be severe enough to justify the intrusion into the general principle of independence of SAs. [ 26 ] Dismissal entails an involuntary preliminary loss of office The GDPR does not specify what these two instances entail, nor is clear regarding which authority is responsible for deciding a member's dismissal, or for what procedural safeguards are in place, if any. These elements should be explicitly provided by a Member State's national law and be precise enough to avoid any misleading interpretation or arbitrariness. The two cases mentioned by Article 53(4) GDPR are contained in several other EU law provisions concerning the dismissal of members of independent bodies. These are Article 247 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\" TFEU \"), which regulates the dismissal of members of the Commission, Article 228(2) TFEU with regard to the dismissal of European Ombudsman, and Article 53(5) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 dealing with the dismissal of European Data Protection Supervisor. [ 27 ] Interpretation of these elements and corresponding provisions by the CJEU may be of relevance for the interpretations of Article 53(4) GDPR. An SA member's actions may amount to serious misconduct, in instances where their actions are deemed incompatible with the duties and obligations of a SA member. These actions could include engaging in criminal activity, the holding of competing offices or engaging in an incompatible occupation. [ 28 ] For example, Article 52(2) GDPR requires SA members to remain free from external influence and Article 52(3) GDPR entails a prohibition of incompatible actions. The failure to fulfil the conditions of office refers to the general conditions required by the Member State's law, such as citizenship and general conditions for officials to hold office, or other circumstances that would permanently prevent an SA member from fulfilling their duties. [ 29 ] The procedure and the responsible authority should allow for an independent decisions regarding the dismissal of an SA member, ensuring that it is by no means politically influenced. For example, courts can be given the competence to decide on the dismissal of SA member. On the other hand, parliaments may not, as a decision on the dismissal of an SA member would be considered political if the deciding body was a Member State's parliament voting by a simple majority.

References 1.   Each Member State shall provide by law for all of the following: 2.   The member or members and the staff of each supervisory authority shall, in accordance with Union or Member State law, be subject to a duty of professional secrecy both during and after their term of office, with regard to any confidential information which has come to their knowledge in the course of the performance of their tasks or exercise of their powers. During their term of office, that duty of professional secrecy shall in particular apply to reporting by natural persons of infringements of this Regulation. Article 54 GDPR lays down the requirements for the organisational framework of supervisory authorities (\" SA s\"). [ 1 ] However, in doing so, it combines two notably different objectives under its ambit. The first of which, under Article 54(1) GDPR, is to list the specifications to be legislated for by each Member States through their national legislation for the establishment and governance of SAs. This provision is largely repetitive of requirements outlined under other Articles of the GDPR, namely in Articles 51, 52 and 53 GDPR. The second objective, under Article 54(2) GDPR, seeks to regulate the confidentiality obligations of SA members and staff. These confidentiality obligations were already in place under Article 28(7) of the GDPR's predecessor, Directive 95/46/EC . [ 2 ] Article 54(1) GDPR mandates Member States to provide for all the elements listed below through their national law. A substantial number of provisions under Article 54(1) GDPR are mainly reiterations of obligations outlined under Articles 51- 53 GDPR. The criteria regulating the establishment of SAs are set out in Article 51(1) and 52 GDPR , Article 54(1)(a) GDPR repeats that these should be legislated for through a Member State's domestic law. [ 3 ] Under the GDPR, Member States are permitted to appoint several different types of SAs, for example, sector specific SAs. [ 4 ] In these instances, the law should provide for the conditions and rules regarding the establishment of each type. In addition, commentators have noted that the functional nature of an SA should also be legislated for through national law. For instance, Member States should legislate for whether their SAs are monocratic or collegial bodies, or whether they have any competences in addition to the monitoring of the enforcement of the GDPR. [ 5 ] For more information regarding the establishment of SAs, please refer to Article 51(1) GDPR and Article 52 GDPR in this Commentary. Article 54(1)(b) GDPR echoes Article 53(2) GDPR , which outlines the qualificatory and experiential requirements for SA members. [ 6 ] However, unlike Article 53(2) GDPR, Article 54(1)(b) GDPR explicitly clarifies that these eligibility requirements are to be determined by national law. [ 7 ] For more information on the eligibility requirements for SA members, please refer to Article 53(2) GDPR . Pursuant to Article 54(1)(c) GDPR, Member States must legislate for the rules and procedures governing the appointment of SA members. This provision is, in essence, a restatement of Article 53(1) GDPR , with the difference that Article 53(1) GDPR further stipulates that any procedure legislated for is ' transparent' . For more information on the procedural requirements for the appointment of SA members, please refer to Article 53(1) GDPR . Pursuant to Article 54(1)(d) GDPR, each Member State is obliged to legislate for SA member(s) term of office. The provision specifies that the minimum term is four years; nonetheless, Member States are free to set longer terms. [ 8 ] However, any attempt to legislate for a term of office that is for life or until retirement should be excluded, as Article 54(1)(e) GDPR addresses the question of reappointment. Therefore, the GDPR assumes a limited term for the position. [ 9 ] Article 54(1)(e) GDPR mandates Member States to legislate for the reappointment of SA members. Member States are entitled to determine whether, and how often the reappointment of members is permitted. For instance, Union law does not prohibit Member States from legislating for reappointment bans, or limitations to the number of consecutive reappointments, or even for the possibility of indefinite reappointments. Notably though, leniency on the possibility of multiple consecutive reappointments has the capacity to undermine the independence of SA members, and by relation, the institutional integrity of SAs as independent bodies. Commentators have noted that, in particular in the context of members' re-election, allowing multiple reappointments risks candidates who have previously held office, to make concessions to the appointing body in favour of their renomination. Admittedly, the risk to independence is countered by the fact that a reappointed member will have greater experience than a candidate who has not previously held office. [ 10 ] Under Article 54(1)(f) GDPR, Member States must (' shall ') legislate for the (i) conditions governing the obligations of members and staff of each SA, (ii) prohibitions on the actions, occupations and benefits incompatible with membership during and after their term of office, as well as (iii) the rules governing the cessation of their employment. While not made explicit under Article 54(1)(f)GDPR, any domestic legislation governing the obligations and prohibitions for SA members during their term of office, must be in line with provisions of Article 52(3) GDPR and Articles 53(3) and 53(4) GDPR . These provisions expand on the conditions outlined under this Article. For instance, Article 52(3) GDPR prohibits SA members from engaging in any incompatible actions and occupations, while Articles 53(3) and 53(4) GDPR regulate the expiry of a member's term of office and dismissal. To clarify, the GDPR's use of the terms ' members ' and ' staff ' differentiate between the two types of SA personnel. The former refers to SAs' lead personnel, while the latter refers to supporting staff. Under Article 54(1)(f) GDPR, rules regulating the actions of staff must also be legislated for through national law. However, these conditions are not required to comply with the strict criteria governing SA members, as provided for provided for in Article 52(3) GDPR and Articles 53(3) and 53(4) GDPR . [ 11 ] For more information on SA members and staff, please refer to Article 52(2) GDPR (SA members) and Article 52(5) GDPR (SA staff). Article 54(1)(f) GDPR is not particularly specific in relation to what obligations are to be imposed upon SA members during their term of office. Elements of what constitute a member's ' obligations ' are found in other Articles of the GDPR. For instance, Article 52 GDPR mandates that members serve their office with integrity. [ 12 ] While, Article 51(1) GDPR outlines SAs' broad purpose of monitoring the GDPR's application, the objectives of which are to protect the right to data protection and facilitate the free flow of personal data within the Union. [ 13 ] Especially relevant to the interpretation of the term ' obligations' by the national legislature are Articles 57 and 58 GDPR, which determine the tasks and powers of SAs. [ 14 ] Any interpretation by national law on the scope and content of incompatible actions, occupations and benefits which SA members and staff are prohibited to take, are to be read in line with Article 52(3) GDPR . Given that GDPR is quite vague in terms of specifying what exactly ' incompatible actions, occupations and benefits ' are, it is particularly important that national legislation does not limit itself to reproducing the text of Articles 52(3) GDPR and 54(1)(f) GDPR. For more information on the conflict of interest rules, please refer to commentary to Article 52(3) GDPR . Member States must adopt appropriate conflict of interest rules for the time during the term in office, as well as for after. In particular, Member States should regulate against the issue of ' revolving doors '. This term refers to the movement of high-level personnel from public roles to those in the private sector, in particular to industries impacted by the work undertaken by those individuals while holding public office. [ 15 ] The European Ombudsman has highlighted that the movement of public officials to the private sector presents risks to the integrity of public bodies, as ' valuable inside knowledge can move into the private sector, or because former officials may lobby their former colleagues or existing officials may be influenced by possible future employment.' [ 16 ] The level of independence required of SAs as public bodies is extremely high. Consequently, even the risk of partiality is sufficient to undermine it. [ 17 ] Therefore, it would be incompatible with the principle of independence if an SA member were to work for a private entity which was under the SA's scrutiny, immediately after their term of office with the SA ended. [ 18 ] A possible solution to curb potential conflicts of interest could be a ' cooling off ' period after the end of a member's term of office. Commentators suggest that periods of 18-24 months should be be viewed as a minimum standard. [ 19 ] At the same time, it is important that any ' cooling off ' periods do not lead to a ban on all professional activities. [ 20 ] Member States are free to regulate for the rules concerning members' and staff's cessation of employment. In this regard, the GDPR does not contain any specific requirements. Naturally, these rules should not infringe upon SAs' independence, as required by Article 52 GDPR . [ 21 ] However, if SA members are legally employed with the SA, any conditions set out by Articles 53(3) and 53(4) GDPR regulating members' end of term or dismissal must also be taken into account by the laws governing their cessation of employment. For more information regarding the conditions regulating SA members' end of term, please refer to Article 53 GDPR . The second paragraph of Article 54 GDPR prohibits any member or staff of an SA from sharing confidential information with a third party, or disclosing it to the public without prior authorisation. The duty of professional secrecy, is at its core an essential element of SAs' investigative powers. In broader terms, the duty of professional secrecy applies as a general principle to the information obtained by SAs in the course of the fulfilment of their role as a supervisory body under Union law. Similar obligations apply to members of competition authorities and other Union regulatory bodies, for instance members of the Commission or European Central Bank. [ 22 ] Notably, the duty of professional secrecy does not extend to SAs' cooperation mechanism under Articles 60 , 61 , 64 , and 65 GDPR . The general duty of professional secrecy finds its footing in primary Union law, under Article 339 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\" TFEU \"). [ 23 ] Transparency considerations arise in relation to the duty of professional secrecy, especially in the context of public access to documents. For instance, access to documents can lawfully be restricted on confidentiality grounds, in particular when they concern the protection of personal data of individuals or the protection of trade secrets. As a result, the duty of professional secrecy is intertwined with the right of access under the right to good administration found in Article 41(2)(b) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (\" CFR \"), [ 24 ] and the right of public access under Article 42 CFR and Regulation 1049/2001. [ 25 ] In relation to these conflicting interests, commentators have noted that the obligation of secrecy should \u201cnot unduly restrict the transparency of DPA [SA] performance, one of the main elements of public accountability of DPAs [SAs].\u201d [ 26 ] The duty of professional secrecy arises in other provisions of the GDPR, namely under Article 38(5) GDPR in relation to data protection officers (\" DPO\" ). For the interpretation of the duty of professional secrecy in regard to DPOs, please refer to Article 38(5) GDPR . The duty of professional secrecy only applies to SA staff and members. Thus, nothing prevents the parties to the proceedings (including the complainant) from sharing the information obtained from the SA, subject to restrictions under national law. Member states may further regulate the duty of professional secrecy through their national legislation. In any case, EU law applies as a minimum threshold, thus Member States may regulate for more stringent requirements but not for less. Article 339 TFEU establishes that ' [t]he members of the institutions of the Union, the members of committees, and the officials and other servants of the Union shall be required, even after their duties have ceased, not to disclose information of the kind covered by the obligation of professional secrecy, in particular information about undertakings, their business relations or their cost components. ' Other relevant legislative provisions include Article 17 of the EU Staff Regulations, [ 27 ] and Article 56 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 (\" EUDPR \"). [ 28 ] Generally, Member States regulate for sector specific confidentiality obligations. In particular, these regulations apply to professionals which handle confidential information on a regular basis, such as doctors, lawyers and public officials. As noted above, Member States may choose to further regulate the confidentiality obligations applying to SAs. The duty of professional secrecy applies to any confidential information which SA members and staff have come into contact with in the course of the performance of their tasks or exercise of their powers. The CJEU clarified, in Bank Austria Creditanstalt v Commission , that information will be considered confidential if it fulfils the following three conditions: (i) if the information is known only to a limited number of people; (ii) disclosure of the information can cause serious harm to the person who has provided it or to third parties; and (iii) the interests likely to be harmed by disclosure must, objectively, be worthy of protection. [ 29 ] Commentators have noted that the test of Article 339 TFEU requires a reinforced protection for business secrets. [ 30 ] Information is only protected if it has come to the knowledge of a member or an employee of a SA ' in the course of the performance of their tasks or exercise of their powers '. Given the broad nature of the tasks and powers afforded to SAs under Articles 57 and 58 GDPR , the duty of professional secrecy applies to all confidential information that SA members and staff come into contact with in the course of their duties, which considering the extent of SAs' work is not an insignificant amount. The duty of professional secrecy, in particular, applies to the reporting of GDPR infringements by natural persons. Considering that protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons is a central component of SAs' role, they must pay particular attention to the protection of the holders of those fundamental rights. [ 31 ] The duty of professional secrecy applies both during and following an SA member's or staff's term of office. There is no specific duration for which the duty of professional secrecy continues to apply after the expiry of the term of office. The period of time should be determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the sensitivity of the information concerned and the potential consequences to be expected from disclosure. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 54 GDPR \u2191 Boehm , in K\u00fchling, Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 54 GDPR, margin number 1 (C.H.

Each supervisory authority shall be competent for the performance of the tasks assigned to and the exercise of the powers conferred on it in accordance with this Regulation on the territory of its own Member State. 2.   Where processing is carried out by public authorities or private bodies acting on the basis of point (c) or (e) of Article 6(1), the supervisory authority of the Member State concerned shall be competent. In such cases Article 56 does not apply. 3.   Supervisory authorities shall not be competent to supervise processing operations of courts acting in their judicial capacity. Article 55 is a provision on jurisdiction. [ 1 ] According to the general rule in paragraph 1, a supervisory authority (SA) has jurisdiction on the territory of its Member State. Paragraphs 2 and 3 contain competence rules for two specific situations, overlaying the principle of territorial competence. Processing in public interest, in the exercise of public authority or to comply with a legal obligation (point c and e of Article 6(1) GDPR) is always supervised by the SA of the Member State concerned, also in cross-border cases. Second, processing by judiciary is partially exempt from supervision by SAs to safeguard the independence of judiciary (separation of powers). Additionally, Article 56 GDPR contains rules on competences of SAs in cases of cross-border processing. A cross-border case occurs and thus Article 56 GDPR is to be consulted where data is processed by several establishments of a processor or controller in the EU/EEA or when processing substantially affects (or is likely to sustainably affect) data subjects in more than one Member State, as per legal definition of cross-border processing in Article 4(23) GDPR . The jurisdiction of a SA is limited to the territory of its own Member State. SAs are entitled to act and exercise their powers on the territory of its own state and their competence ends at the border of it's Member State. This reflects the basic principle of public international law, the principle of sovereignty: a state has the power to enforce the law within its national borders through its national authorities. [ 2 ] On the other hand, each state is prohibited to exercise power or authority on the territory of another state. [ 3 ] Example: French DPA can conduct an investigation on the premises of a controller, if the premises is located in France. At the same time the French DPA cannot on its own conduct an investigation on the premises of a processor, if the premises is located in Spain. It also means that a decision issued by a SA cannot be enforced in another state.\nExample: If the Austrian SA would issue a decision by which it would ban further processing of data and impose a 150.000 EUR fine against a controller from France that has no establishment in Austria the Austrian authority would not have the power or any means to force the controller to comply with the decision and pay the fine since it is not on the territory of Austria. This was confirmed by CJEU in C-230/14 - Weltimmo . The judgement, among others, confirmed the territorial nature of competences, performance of tasks and exercising of powers of SAs. It concerned the interpretation of Article 28 GDPR of Directive 95/46, the GDPR predecessor. It stays relevant with regard to concepts explained and guiding principles regarding SAs' competences, including their duty to cooperate with other SAs, where necessary to enforce the law in order to provide effective protection to individuals. [ 4 ] The limitation of jurisdiction to the territory of the state \u201cconfirms the role of SA as enforcement authorities, having competence on national territory equal to other public bodies and judicial authorities.\u201d [ 5 ] For the competence to be vested with a SA of a Member State a link must exist between a data processing concerned and SA's territory. Recital 122 specifies situations when such link is considered to exists and competence should, in particularly,  be vested with a SA of a Member State. This is where processing either takes place in the context of the activities of an establishment on SA's territory, affects data subjects on its territory, or where processing, by a controller or processor without an establishment in the EU/EEA, is targeting data subjects residing on its territory. Recital 122 reference points reflect the criteria defining the territorial application of the GDPR from Article 3 GDPR confirming that there is always a SA competent to supervise and enforce the application of the GDPR whenever it applies. The variety and flexibility of reference points takes into account the variety and flexibility of processing operations in the digital world, where the place of processing is not necessarily relevant for the effects that respective processing has on individuals. [ 6 ] To have jurisdiction in situations where competence is linked to the establishment on its territory data does not need to be physically processed by the controller or processor nor must the controller or processor be formally established in that Member State. The concepts of \"in the context of its activities\" and \"establishment\" are much wider. Case law: In Google Spain CJEU ruled that personal data, which were de facto processed by the global search engine provider Google Search, were also processed in the context of the commercial and advertising activities of its Spanish subsidiary that was promoting and selling advertising space offered by that engine in the territory of Spain and thus making the service offered by that engine profitable. [ 7 ] According to CJEU concept of \u2018establishment\u2019 extends to any real and effective activity, even a minimal one, exercised through stable arrangements. [ 8 ] \" Legal form of such arrangements, whether through a branch or a subsidiary with a legal personality, is not the determining factor.\" Recital 22 GDPR resonates these case law. The concept is flexible and appropriate to ensure effective and complete protection of the individual. [ 9 ] Case law: In Weltimmo CJEU considered that operating a website by a company of one state in the language of another state and having, among others, a representative in that state, who was actively involved in certain operations of the company in that state, presents real and effective activity through stable arrangements vesting the competence to hear claims of individuals with the SA of that state. [ 10 ] On the other hand, as confirmed in C-191/15 - Verein f\u00fcr Konsumenteninformation , the mere accessibility of a website in a Member State does not suffice to constitute establishment and vest competence with the SA of that state. [ 11 ] The concepts of \"in the context of its activities\" and \"establishment\" are further discussed in Article 4 GDPR of this commentary. The competent SA is simple to determine in cases where the processing concerned takes place within the establishment of a controller or processor in one Member State and concerns only data subjects on the territory of the same state. The national SA of that state will be competent to handle a complaint, conduct an investigation, issue a decision and a fine or to carry out any other task and exercise any other power conferred on it by the GDPR. Example: Polish SA will be competent to handle a complaint lodged with it by a Hungarian citizen living in Poland with regard to processing of her data by the Polish company Spring. For cross-border processing ( Article 4(23) GDPR ), where processing takes place in more than one establishment of a processor or controller in the EU/EEA or where processing substantially affects or is likely to substantial affect data subjects in more than one Member State the competences are allocated between SAs, which would be competent under Article 55(1) GDPR, as provided in Article 56 GDPR in connection with Article 60 GDPR . For more information see commentary to respective articles. In other cases with transnational elements, for instance, if the data of a data subject of one Member State where the complaint was filed is processed by a controller established in another State or if the server with the data is in another Member State and needs to be inspected on sight, SAs from several Member States might have to work together to provide for effective protection and enforcement of the GDPR. GDPR provides the necessary tools in Articles 61 (mutual assistance)  and 62 GDPR (joint operations), which apply not only when the conditions for cross-border processing are fulfilled but also for other cases of processing with transnational elements. The cooperation between SAs is mandatory in each case where it is not possible to effectively protect the rights of individuals and enforce the GDPR without it. Case law: In case C-230/14, Weltimmo , CJEU held that for finding an infringement and imposing penalties the SA where the complaint was lodged must request cooperation of the SA of the establishment in accordance with the rules on cooperation. At the same time CJEU pointed out that \u201c the law should make it possible for individuals to enforce their right to protection \u201d [ 12 ] A SA is also competent when processing carried out by a controller or processor not established in the EU/EEA is targeting data subjects residing on its territory. The targeting can be done in relation to offering goods or services or through monitoring their behaviour. This refers to situations when GDPR is applicable according to Article 3(2) GDPR . In these situations, several SAs can be competent to act in parallel, each with regard to the processing of data of their residents. [ 13 ] In this situations the main question is how to enforce a decision when a violation of the GDPR is established. In particularly, how corrective measures and fines can be enforced, since the controller or processor are located outside the territory and thus outside the reach of any Member State, especially in situations when a controller has not designated a representative on \u00a0the territory of the European Union (in breach of Article 27(1) GDPR ). In such situations s SA may ask the competent authorities of the country of the processor for cooperation under an international agreement between the countries. [ 14 ] It  may also order that the data has to remain within the Union and cannot be transferred to a third country. The competence of a SA extends to all of the tasks assigned to it and powers conferred to it by the GDPR, as long as the tasks are performed and the powers exercised on the territory of its own Member State. This is confirmed by the wording of Article 57 GDPR and Article 58 GDPR the main articles on tasks and powers of SAs, respectively. Both Articles explicitly limit SA's performance of entailed tasks and the exercising of conferred powers to the territory of its own Member State. The competence with regard to tasks and powers  \" include handling complaints lodged by a data subject, conducting investigations on the application of this Regulation and promoting public awareness of the risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data\" as noted in Recital 122. While Article 55 GDPR vests the competence with the SA to perform tasks assigned to it and powers conferred to it, Articles 57 and 58 GDPR impose the obligation to perform all the tasks and exercise the powers, when applicable. The jurisdiction of a SA and its coercive power is limited to the territory of its own state due to the principle of sovereignty. This means that a SA of one Member State cannot use its powers outside the borders of it's state, on the territory of another state. [ 15 ] CJEU ruled on the territorial limitation of performance of tasks and exercising of powers in Weltimmo judgement ( C-230/14) . Case law: In case C-230/14, Weltimmo , CJEU stated that a SA cannot impose penalties outside the territory of its own Member State but it can examine a complaint and exercise investigative powers against a company established in another Member State which was directing its activities to residents of its state. [ 12 ] This provision should not be understood as an obligation that each SA must be competent for the whole territory where several SAs co-exist in one Member State. It is a question of national law to determine the jurisdiction of SAs when a state takes advantage of the option provided under Article 51(3) GDPR to establish several SAs. [ 16 ] The GDPR in several provisions mandates Member States to adopt more specific national rules on data protection, such as on special categories of data ( Article 9 GDPR ) or human resources data ( Article 88 GDPR ). It is not evident which national law is applicable in such instances as GDPR does not contain any rules on applicable law for data processed within the Union. The SA of one state may have to apply the national rules of another state in such cases concerning such situations. [ 17 ] Article 55(2) GDPR regulates the SA\u2019s competence in case of processing carried out by public authorities or private bodies complying with a legal obligation or performing a task in the public interest. The provision confirms the competence of the SA in whose Member State the public authority or private body is located. In such cases, Article 56 GDPR will not apply and the only competent SA to exercise its powers should be the one where the public authority or private body is established. This rule thus establishes the exclusive jurisdiction of the national SA. [ 18 ] The rule should prevent SAs of another state from monitoring public authorities and other bodies carrying out tasks in public interest. Also, the monitoring of processing of data to comply with a legal obligation imposed by the public law of a Member State, such as collection of telecommunication data, should be subject to control by the national SA of that state. [ 19 ] This provision applies to public authorities when they perform their public duties by virtue of Article 6(1)(c)(e) GDPR . According to Recital 128 GDPR the rules on the LSA and the one-stop-shop mechanism should not apply where the processing is carried out by public authorities. In such cases the only supervisory authority competent should be the supervisory authority of the state where the public authority is established. [ 20 ] Any other activities by a public body, such as publicly owned undertaking, that would not be performance of public tasks, such as commercial activities, are not subject to the exception under Article 55(2) GDPR. There may be a LSA. [ 21 ] Also, private entities performing tasks under a legal obligation or in the public interest will not be subject to the cooperation mechanism. That would imply that the obligation of air carriers to retain data or data retention obligation of electronic communication providers would not be subject to the one-stop shop procedure. However, when the private entity is processing data under any other legal basis than Article 6(1)(c)(e) , for example based on consent or contract ( Article 6(1)(b) ), the same entity is subject to Article 56. This means that in case of cross-border processing the LSA will be responsible for monitoring the entities' compliance with the GDPR. This can lead to situations where the same entity can be subject to monitoring by different SAs in relation to different processing of same data. For example : Passenger data that are collected by airlines for commercial purposes are subject to control by the LSA (SA of main establishment of the airline). When data on passengers is transferred to the public authority where the plane will land or take off under Article 8 Directive 2016/681, the transfer is subject to the control of the SA of the Member State on the territory of which the plane will land or take off. [ 22 ] In order to protect the independence of the judiciary, Article 55(3) GDPR exempts SAs from supervising the activities of courts and other judicial authorities when they are acting in their judicial capacity. That does not mean that their activities are not subject to the GDPR, since this would be contrary to Article 8(3) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights (CFR) but rather that the monitoring of personal data by the judiciary should be entrusted to specific bodies within the judicial system of the Member State. [ 23 ] Even if Article 55(3) GDPR only mention courts, it seems obvious that other judicial bodies \u2013 such as the prosecutor office \u2013 should be subject to independent supervision separate from the SA. [ 24 ] This is confirmed by Article 80 of the Law Enforcement Directive (Directive (EU) 2016/680) that states that courts and other independent judicial authorities should always be subject to independent supervision. Courts are not totally exempt from control by SAs. They are exempt only when they are acting in their judicial capacity, but not regarding activities that are outside their judicial capacity. Case law: CJEU considered in case C-245/20 - Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens that processing of personal data carried out in the context of a court's communication policy on cases falls outside the competence of a SA. [ 25 ] On the other hand, activities of judicial administration, such as practices, procedures and offices that deal with the management of the system of the courts are subject to the control by a SA. Thus, processing of the data of the staff hired by a court remains subject to the supervision of the SA. Case law: In case C-245/20 - Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens CJEU clarified that processing operations carried out by courts \u2018acting in their judicial capacity\u2019 must be understood, as not being limited to the processing of data in specific cases, but as referring, more broadly, to all processing operations carried out by courts in the course of their judicial activity whose supervision by a SA would be likely, whether directly or indirectly, to have an influence on the independence of their members or to weigh on their decisions.

Without prejudice to Article 55, the supervisory authority of the main establishment or of the single establishment of the controller or processor shall be competent to act as lead supervisory authority for the cross-border processing carried out by that controller or processor in accordance with the procedure provided in Article 60. 2.   By derogation from paragraph 1, each supervisory authority shall be competent to handle a complaint lodged with it or a possible infringement of this Regulation, if the subject matter relates only to an establishment in its Member State or substantially affects data subjects only in its Member State. 3.   In the cases referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, the supervisory authority shall inform the lead supervisory authority without delay on that matter. Within a period of three weeks after being informed the lead supervisory authority shall decide whether or not it will handle the case in accordance with the procedure provided in Article 60, taking into account whether or not there is an establishment of the controller or processor in the Member State of which the supervisory authority informed it. 4.   Where the lead supervisory authority decides to handle the case, the procedure provided in Article 60 shall apply. The supervisory authority which informed the lead supervisory authority may submit to the lead supervisory authority a draft for a decision. The lead supervisory authority shall take utmost account of that draft when preparing the draft decision referred to in Article 60(3). 5.   Where the lead supervisory authority decides not to handle the case, the supervisory authority which informed the lead supervisory authority shall handle it according to Articles 61 and 62. 6.   The lead supervisory authority shall be the sole interlocutor of the controller or processor for the cross-border processing carried out by that controller or processor. In cross-border cases (Article 4(23) GDPR), several supervisory authorities (SA) could be competent according to Article 55 GDPR . For this reason, Article 56(1) GDPR establishes a specific mechanism to keep all the competent SAs involved and at the same time ensure the consistent application of the GDPR by issuing of one decision.  This would be undermined in case of conflicting decisions on the same subject matter. The provision identifies a lead supervisory authority (LSA). This is the SA where the controller or the processor have their main establishment or single establishment ( Article 4(16) GDPR ) in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA).  Under Article 56(2-5) GDPR, the LSA\u2019s competence can be waived, in particular if the cross-border processing at stake has only a local impact. Article 56(6) GDPR introduces the one-stop shop mechanism. Whenever an LSA is validly appointed, it is to be the sole interlocutor of the controller or processor. Article 56 GDPR makes a direct reference to Article 55 GDPR (Competence), Article 60 GDPR (cooperation between LSE and other SA concerned (CSA)), Article 61 GDPR (mutual assistance) and Article 62 GDPR (joint operations of SAs). Additional provisions that are closely related to Article 56 GDPR are Article 4(7) GDPR (definition of controller), Article 4(8) GDPR (definition of processor), Article 4(16) GDPR (definition of main establishment), Article 4(21) GDPR (definition of SA), Article 4(22) GDPR (definition of SA concerned(CSA)), Article 4(23) GDPR (definition of cross-border processing), Article 57 GDPR (tasks of SAs), Article 58 GDPR (powers of SAs), as well as Article 65 GDPR (dispute resolution by the board), Article 63 GDPR (consistency mechanism), Article 64 GDPR (opinion of the board), Article 66 GDPR (urgency procedure) and Article 67 GDPR (exchange of information). Article 55 GDPR confirms the general rule that breaches of data protection law occurring in a given Member State are investigated and possibly punished by the independent authority of that Member State. However, the processing of personal data often presents transnational features due, for example, to the existence of several establishments of the data controller within the territory of the EU/EEA ( \"Union\" ). [ 1 ] In such circumstances, the general rule of Article 55 GDPR would require each independent authority to decide on a certain processing of personal data, with the obvious consequence of possible inconsistencies of application in case of divergent decisions. This would be in contradiction with one of the main objectives of the GDPR, namely to \u201c ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons and to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data within the Union, the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all Member States \u201d (Recital 10 GDPR). In that view, Article 56 GDPR provides for an alternative decision-making procedure under two conditions: (i) the processing is of a cross-border nature, and (ii) the controller or processor has a main establishment or a single establishment in the EU/EEA. Where these conditions are met, Article 56 GDPR, in conjunction with Article 60 GDPR and Article 65 GDPR ,  reserves part of the powers and tasks originally held by SAs under Article 55 GDPR for the (lead) SA where the main establishment or the single establishment of the controller or processor is located. Provided that one of the establishments in the EU/EEA of the controller takes the decisions on the purposes and means for the relevant processing operations and has the power to have these decisions implemented. When these decisions are taken and powers are exercised outside of the EU/EEA, there is no main establishment under Article 4(16)(a) GDPR, and the one-stop-shop mechanism does not apply according to EDPB Opinion 04/2024. [ 2 ] \u201c Without prejudice to \u201d presents a clarification that when the derogation from Article 55 applies, other SAs concerned are not losing their competences, but are limited in carrying them out. LSA\u2019s competence is not exclusive. In fact, even if the LSA is in charge of directing the investigation and the decision-making process, it is still obliged to ensure dialogue with the other SAs and to take their positions into consideration as a matter of priority. Moreover, LSA\u2019s position on substance is no stronger than that of any other CSA. In case of dispute the consistency mechanism is triggered and the EDPB adopts a binding decision under Article 65 GDPR . [ 3 ] Second, the derogation from the rules of Article 55 GDPR, by Article 56(1) with the one-stop-shop mechanism with the LSA, is only partial. First, it is not applicable where processing is carried out by public authorities or private bodies under Article 55(2) GDPR . [ 4 ] This can result in several SAs being competent with regard to a cross-border processing activity when a company is processing the same data to comply with statutory requirements and for commercial purposes. Example: Spanish telecommunications company Y, with clients from all over Europe and the main establishment in France, is storing phone records for law enforcement purposes and to comply with its contractual obligations. With regard to the processing activities for law enforcement purposes the Spanish SA is the competent SA. For processing activities in the context of contractual services, such as billing, the French SA will act as the LSA. Under Article 56(1) GDPR the SA of the main establishment or single establishment of the controller or the processor in the EU/EEA is (\u201cshall be\u201d) competent to act as LSA for cross-border processing of that controller or processor. While, according to EDPB Opinion 4/2024 for the one-stop-shop mechanism to apply  this main or single establishment of the controller must take decisions on the purposes and means for the relevant processing and have the power to have these decisions implemented. EDPB Opinion 4/2024: The one-stop-shop mechanism can only apply if there is evidence that one of the establishments in the Union of the controller takes the decisions on the purposes and means for the relevant processing operations and has the power to have these decisions implemented. Otherwise there is no main establishment under Article 4(16)(a) GDPR, and the one-stop-shop mechanism does not apply. [ 5 ] Recital 22 GDPR, following the CJEU ruling in Weltimmo defines \u201c establishment \u201d as \u201c the effective and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements \u201d. [ 6 ] The legal form of such arrangements is irrelevant. The presence of only one representative can in some circumstances suffice. [ 7 ] For more information see commentary to Article 4(16) GDPR . The GDPR uses separate criteria for determining the main establishment of a processor and of a controller. As a general rule, as per Article 4(16)(a) GDPR , the main establishment of a controller is the place of its central administration in the EU/EEA. This is however a rebuttable presumption, since another establishment can also be the main establishment, according to Article 4(16) GDPR , when the decisions on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are taken in another establishment in the EU/EEA and the latter establishment has the power to have such decisions implemented. For more information, see commentary on Article 4(16) GDPR , EDPB Guidelines 8/2022 on identifying a controller or processor\u2019s lead supervisory authority and Opinion 04/2024 on the notion of main establishment of a controller in the Union under Art. 4.16(a) GDPR . The main establishment of a processor with establishments in more than one Member State is the place of its central administration. In cases where the processor has no central administration in the EU/EEA, the GDPR provides that its main establishment is the place where the main processing activities take place in the EU/EEA (i) in the context of the activities of an establishment of the processor and (ii) to the extent that the processor is subject to specific obligations under the GDPR. The first qualification \u201c implies that the processing of personal data does not need to be carried out 'by' the relevant establishment itself, rather that it is sufficient if the processing is carried out 'in the context of the activities' of the establishment.\" [ 8 ] The second qualification confirms the scope of application of the GDPR to processors. For more information, refer to commentary on Article 4(16) GDPR and EDPB Guidelines 8/2022 on identifying a controller or processor\u2019s lead supervisory authority . In the case of a group of undertaking with a headquarter in the EU/EEA, the main establishment will be presumed to be the decision-making center relating to the processing of personal data. [ 9 ] However, if the decisions relating to the processing are taken by another establishment of the controller in the EU/EEA, the latter should be considered the main establishment. [ 10 ] If a controller or a processor has establishments in more than one Member State, identifying its \u201c main establishment \u201d is the first step to recognize the LSA in a cross-border processing. [ 11 ] The EDPB stresses that the GDPR does not allow \u201cforum shopping\u201d. It is a role of the SAs to properly define the main establishment according to objective criteria and subsequently determine the LSA. EDPB provided following, not exhaustive list of questions to determine a controller\u2019s main establishment: Where are decisions about the purposes and means of the processing given final \u201csign off\u201d? Where are decisions about business activities that involve data processing made? Where does the power to have decisions implemented effectively lie? Where is the Director (or Directors) with overall management responsibility for the cross-border processing located? Where is the controller or processor registered as a company, if in a single territory?\u201d. [ 12 ] The conclusion of the location of the main establishment cannot be based only on a statement of the organisation under review. The controllers and processors have to demonstrate where the relevant processing decisions are taken and where there is the power to implement such decisions. SAs can rebut the controller's analysis based on an objective examination of the relevant facts, requesting further information where required. The burden of proof is with the controllers and processors. [ 13 ] Therefore the designation of one of several establishments in different Member States as the main establishment in the organizational chart is not sufficient to establish the LSA competence under Article 65(1) GDPR. [ 14 ] Example: Company X has designated a mailbox company in Estonia in organisational chart as its central administration, while all decisions regarding cross-border processing are made and enforced by its establishment located in France. The LSA is the French SA and not the Estonian SA. The main establishment is determined for each cross-border processing activity separately. This means that where different establishments are in charge of making decisions about different categories of cross-border processing, for example one for processing of customers\u2019 data for advertising purposes and another for processing of employees\u2019 data, and can also enforce their decisions, different LSAs will be in charge for each cathegory of cross-border processing. Example: Bike rental company XT has establishments in Germany, Austria and Hungary. Exclusively the establishment in Hungary is in charge of advertising, and the establishment in Austria for all decisions related to human resources. In this case  the LSA for processing related to advertising is the Hungarian SA and for processing of employees data the Austrian SA. Companies can avoid situations leading to competence of different LSAs for different cross-border processing activities by putting one undertaking in charge of all decisions that are of data-protection relevance. [ 15 ] In cases involving both the controller and the processor, the competent LSA remains the SA of the controller, if there is one. In such a case, the SA of the processor will be a concerned SA as per Article 4(22) GDPR . However, this is not the case if the draft decision concerns only the controller (Recital 36 GDPR). In cases where the processor is acting for several controllers, it may then be subject to the competence of several SAs. [ 16 ] The GDPR does not address the situation of joint controllership and does not define specific criteria to determine the LSA. However, according to Article 26(1) GDPR, the controllers have to in a transparent manner determine their respective responsibilities for compliance with the obligations under the GDPR. EDPB considers that agreement between the controller could designate the establishment having the power to implement decisions about the processing with respect to the joint controllership. [ 17 ] This could also be supported by the wording of Recital 79 GDPR, which implies that the agreement regarding the allocation of responsibilities among controllers should also concern the monitoring and the measures of the SAs. However, this seems in contradiction with the aim expressed by the EDPB to avoid forum shopping. [ 18 ] Some difficulties may arise when none of the EU/EEA establishments are making decisions about the processing (even with a headquarter in the EU/EU/EU/EEA). In such a case, significantly called \u201c borderline cases \u201d by the EDPB, [ 19 ] the GDPR does not provide for a clear answer. While the GDPR wants to encourage the non EU controller to be established in the EU/EEA to benefit from the one-stop shop, forum shopping should be avoided. The idea of the one-stop shop is to provide a single SA as interlocutor for the controller and to facilitate the dialogue with the main establishment making the decisions on the processing. When the latter is located outside EU/EEA, such controller cannot profit from the one-stop-shop mechanism for cross-border processing and must deal with local SAs in every Member State concerned. [ 20 ] In case of \u201c conflicting views \u201d on which of the SA concerned is the LSA, the EDPB adopts a decision under the dispute resolution mechanism ( Article 65(1)(b) GDPR ). It seems that the decision on a conflicting view can only be taken within a specific procedure under Article 65(1)(b) GDPR and conflicting views on the LSA cannot be addressed via a reasoned objection within a procedure under Article 65(1)(a) GDPR . In its decision on the dispute resolution mechanism in case Twitter, the EDPB considered \u201c that a disagreement on the competence of the supervisory authority acting as LSA to issue a decision in the specific case should not be raised through an objection pursuant to Article 60(4) GDPR and falls outside of the scope of Article 4(24) GDPR .\u201d [ 21 ] GDPR does not address change of main establishment in the course of cooperation and consistency mechanism, the EDPB considers that \u201c the lead competence can switch to another SA until a final decision is made by the LSA \u201d. [ 22 ] Thus, its competence is not definite until the very end of the procedure. [ 23 ] The EDPB stressed that to prevent \u201c forum shopping \u201d, \u201c SAs should exercise effective control over the notion of main establishment in order to reduce the risk that controllers or processors artificially change their main establishment for the purpose of changing the competent authority to handle the case \u201d. [ 24 ] While EDPB guidelines are useful, there are doubts about the chosen solution and its effectiveness. [ 25 ] At the same time this solution prevents problems of enforceability of LSA decisions in another Member State, which would emerge if the competence would be linked to the time when the complaint was lodged. One of the conditions for triggering the competence of the LSA and the cooperation mechanism of Article 60 GDPR is the existence of a cross-border processing. The definition of cross-border processing is provided by Article 4(23) GDPR which stipulates that such a processing takes place in the context of the activities [ 26 ] of either (a) establishments in more than one Member State of a controller or processor in the EU/EEA where the controller or processor is established in more than one Member State; or (b) a single establishment of a controller or processor in the EU/EEA which substantially affects [ 27 ] or is likely to substantially affect data subjects in at least one other Member State. Example: Bike rental company XT has establishments in Hungary, Austria and Slovenia. Decision on processing, e.g. data that is collected, purposes for which it can be used and for how long it is stored,  are made in Austria and implemented in every establsihment. \nExample: Company TX from Checz Republic is providing online services to customers from all over EU/EEA and in for that purpose collecting and storing their data. On the other hand, the processing by a controller only established in one Member State which substantially only affects the individuals in this Member State will not meet the conditions. Example:  A Polish company, which is a branch of a Swedish company, processes human resources data of its employees alone, the processed data relates only to its employees and any decision about the purposes and means of this processing is taken by the Polish company, e.g. the Human resources policy, and also the servers on which these data are held is in Poland. There is no cross-border processing and Article 56 of the GDPR does not apply in this case. [ 28 ] For more information, please, refer to the commentary to Article 4(23) GDPR . Article 56(2) GDPR introduces an exception (\u201c by derogation \u201d)\u00a0 to the general competence of the SA of the main establishment for cases of cross-border processing under first paragraph ( \"from paragraph 1\" ). Article 56(2) GDPR provides that a SA which is not the LSA is to be competent to (a) handle a complaint lodged with it concerning a cross-border processing of personal data or (b) a possible infringement of the GDPR, if the subject matter (i) relates only to an establishment in its own Member State or (ii) substantially affects data subjects only in that Member State. In particular, a case is local in nature if the controller is established in more than one Member State, but the subject matter of the specific processing concerns only processing carried out in a single state and involves only data subjects in that state, for example, where the subject matter concerns the processing of employees' personal data in the specific employment context of a Member State (Recital 127). EDPB adopted Internal EDPB Document 1/2019 on procedural steps to be applied by SAs for handling of cases that potentially relate to cross-border processing and in particularly cases with only local impacts under Article 56.2 GDPR (\"EDPB Internal Document\"). [ 29 ] Example: Due to repeated thefts occurring in a store located in France, of a retail company established in several Member States, the Italian headquarters decides to use video surveillance for the store in France. Since the Italian establishment determines the purposes and means of this monitoring system, this is a cross-border processing and the controller\u2019s main establishment is in Italy. If a French employee (or a customer) lodges a complaint regarding the use of the surveillance-camera with the French SA, the SA may find that this case is of local nature, since no other establishment, except the French, makes use of video-surveillance. [ 30 ] On the contrary, the resolution of a case of video surveillance systems implemented in stores in more than one Member States, as a matter of general policy, which infringes GDPR\u2019s provisions, for example due to allegedly excessive retention period of the video surveillance data, is not only relating to the establishment located in one Member State. [ 30 ] According to the EDPB \" [t]o be considered as a local case, the actual impact of it should be limited to data subjects residing in the SA\u2019s Member State. \" [ 31 ] Example: An online retail company sells products that can be delivered throughout EU/EEA. The website provides information about the processing of personal data in many languages used in the EU/EU/EEA. The Islandic linguistic version is incomplete and this language is spoken only in a single Member State Iceland. In this situation, the case could be considered as having only local impacts in the SA\u2019s territory. If the SA considers that the case is likely  to impact individuals in another Member State, it should consider that this is not a local case. Example:  An online order form from a retail company requires that all customers (located in several Member States) provide information that is not necessary to deliver the products. The subject matter of the case as well as the resolution of this case will substantially affect data subjects in several Member States. Also a case about a cross-border processing that is in line with the GDPR but infringes the national legislation could have only local impacts. Example: The Italian main establishment of a company decides to implement video-surveillance in each of its establishments. The French national law about video-surveillance in public space provides that the images should not be stored more than one month, and the retention period of data is excessive only according to this national law, the resolution of the case would be only relating to the local establishment and would concern only data subjects in France. [ 32 ] The competence of local SAs in local cases reflects one of the principles of the GDPR, namely the principle of proximity as an important aspect of the protection of individuals rights. [ 33 ] Nevertheless, the local SA will handle a case with a subject matter of a local nature only, if the LSA does not decide to handle it (see below). Under Article 56(3) GDPR, in the event of a \u201clocal case\u201d under Article 56(2) GDPR, the SA must inform the LSA \u201c without delay \u201d on that matter. The LSA must respond within a period of three weeks whether or not it will handle the case. To make this decision, the (L)SA will take into account of the presence of an establishment of the controller or processor in the Member State of which the SA informed it. The existence of an establishment in the Member State of the local SA is to be taken into account, \u201c in order to ensure effective enforcement of a decision vis-\u00e0-vis the controller or processor. \u201d [ 34 ] According to the EDPB Internal Document 1/2019 the (L)SA should also take into account whether the case raises a new matter of principle which has not yet been resolved at the European level. [ 35 ] In its Internal Document the EDPB clarifies that a matter has been addressed at European level, when it has been decided on the merits, either by the LSA following the cooperation procedure, or by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) or by the case law of the CJEU or the European Court of Human Rights. [ 36 ] In the event that the LSA does not decide within the three week period whether it will handle the case the local SA can trigger the  mutual assistance procedure under Article 61 GDPR , in order to receive an answer from the LSA. Followed by a request to obtaining an opinion from the EDPB under Article 64(2) GDPR, if the LSA does not comply with the obligations for mutual assistance within one month. [ 37 ] If the LSA decides to handle the case, the one-stop shop procedure introduced in Article 60 GDPR is triggered. However, the SA which informed the LSA about the subject matter may submit to the LSA a draft for a decision. According to the EDPB Internal Guidelines the LSA must take at most account of that draft, \" except where there are specific, overriding reasons preventing it. \" [ 38 ] The local SA remains in a strong position since it can still suggest a draft decision to the LSA, which is in general competent to draw up a draft decisions in accordance with Article 60(3) GDPR .For more information see commentary to Article 60 GDPR . Paragraphs 4 and 5, in contrast to paragraphs 2 and 3, does not make any reference to local cases. Therefore one possible interpretation of these two paragraphs is, that they do not apply only in local cases but in any cross-border case, where the LSA in fact does not act and does not handle the case as it is obliged to under Article 60 GDPR. [ 39 ] This means that the SA where the complaint was lodged is also competent to handle the cross-border case  according to Article 61 GDPR and Article 62 GDPR , if the LSA fails to handle the case. (see paragraph 5 below). If the LSA decides not to handle a local case, Article 56(5) GDPR provides that the SA which triggered the procedure handles it according to Article 61 GDPR and Article 62 GDPR .  Those provisions require the SAs to comply with the rules on mutual assistance and cooperation within the framework of joint operations, in order to ensure effective cooperation between the authorities concerned. EDPB Internal Document 1/2019 forsees that the local SA exercises its full range of powers pursuant to Article 58 GDPR , including the corrective powers. Also, \" when the cross-border case is handled \u201clocally\u201d, the LSA is not the sole interlocutor of the controller or processor \" as provided for in Article 56(6) GDPR (see below). [ 40 ] Paragraph 5, just as paragraph 4 and contraty to paragraphs 2 and 3, does not in any way refer to local cases it can be argued that it can be applied also in case of inactivity of the LSA. The SA that informed the LSA about the assumed infringement of the GDPR relating to cross-border processing that would require the LSA to handle the case in accordance with procedure prvided in Article 60 GDPR, was obliged to handle it (\"shall handle it\"), if the LSA failed to do so (see also commentary to paragraph 4 above). Article 56(6) GDPR provides that the LSA is the sole interlocutor of the controller or the processor. That means that, in case of cross-border processing, the communication should exclusively take place with the LSA, to avoid that the controller or processor would have multiple discussions with several SAs. In addition to relief from bureaucratic burdens, the \"[e]xclusive contacts with a controller or processor are a means to streamline the procedure.\" [ 41 ] At the same time, in relation to other CSAs, the LSA \"must exercise such competence within a framework of close cooperation with the other supervisory authorities concerned.\" [ 42 ] Article 56 GDPR does not specify whether the LSA remains the sole interlocutor of the controller or processor where the local SA is handling the case under Article 56(5) GDPR. The EDPB Internal Document 1/2019 suggests that  \" when the cross-border case is handled \u201clocally\u201d, the LSA is not the sole interlocutor of the controller or processor \". [ 43 ] However, not all scholars share this view. [ 44 ] Some scholars suggest a pragmatic approach to avoid communication issues with the controller or processor. [ 45 ] This provision is not determining data subject's contact point. According to Article 77(1) GDPR , the data subject can contact a SA of his choice when filing a complaint and the SA whit which the complaint was lodged stays his pont of contact throughout the procedure. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 56 GDPR \u2191 The GDPR applies for all states of EEA.

The Court built on a broad definition of \u201c establishment \u201d and held that intending to promote and sell advertising space by an establishment in a Member State of a third country undertaking to make the latter profitable is carried out \u201cin the context of the activities\u201d of that establishment\" (CJEU, 13 May 2014, Google Spain , C-131/12 (available here ); and CJEU, 1 October 2015, Weltimmo , C-230/14 (available here ). The EDPB also confirmed that this notion should not be interpreted too restrictively considering the view to fulfil the objective of ensuring effective and complete protection. See, See EDPB, Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3), 12 November 2019, p. 7 (available here ). \u2191 The notion of \u201c substantial effect \u201d on data subjects as mentioned by Article 4(23)(b) is not defined in the GDPR. In its guidelines (endorsed by the EDPB), the Working Party 29 considered that the number of affected individuals in several Member States is not decisive. Rather, the Working Party developed a following, non-exhaustive list of criteria that will be taken into account on a case by case basis. The guidelines suggest to take into account the context of the processing, the type of data, the purpose of the processing and other factor factors, such as potential discrimination, reputational damage, impact on the well-being or involvement of special categories of data.

Without prejudice to other tasks set out under this Regulation, each supervisory authority shall on its territory: 2.   Each supervisory authority shall facilitate the submission of complaints referred to in point (f) of paragraph 1 by measures such as a complaint submission form which can also be completed electronically, without excluding other means of communication. 3.   The performance of the tasks of each supervisory authority shall be free of charge for the data subject and, where applicable, for the data protection officer. 4.   Where requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, the supervisory authority may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs, or refuse to act on the request. The supervisory authority shall bear the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded or excessive character of the request. Article 57(1) GDPR contains a detailed, albeit not exhaustive, list of mandatory tasks assigned to the supervisory authorities (SAs). [ 1 ] Articles 57(2) to (4) GDPR require SAs to facilitate the submission of complaints  and not to charge fees to data subjects, except for manifestly unfounded or excessive requests. Articles that are related to Article 57 GDPR include Article 4(21) GDPR (definition of a supervisory authority); Article 28(8) GDPR (adoption of processors\u2019 standard contractual clauses); Article 36(2) GDPR (prior consultation); Article 40 GDPR  (codes of conduct); Article 42 GDPR  (certification); Article 46 GDPR (standard data protection clauses for data transfers); Article 47 GDPR (approval of binding corporate rules); Article 50 GDPR (international cooperation for the protection of personal data); Article 58 GDPR (powers); Article 59 GDPR (activity reports); Article 60 GDPR (cooperation between supervisory authorities); Article 61 GDPR (mutual assistance); Article 62 GDPR (joint operations ); Article 70 GDPR (tasks of the Board), Article 77 GDPR (complaint handling and investigations); and Article 83 GDPR (administrative fines). [ 2 ] Article 57(1) GDPR sets out a list of 21 tasks that each SA must (\" shall \") perform on its territory. The detailed regulation aims at creating an equivalent level of data protection within the EU through a \"uniform implementation framework \" (Recital 123 GDPR, 129 GDPR). [ 3 ] Tasks listed in Article 57(1) GDPR can be divided into: monitoring and enforcement activities (points a, f, h and g), investigation and audit activities ( points f and h), advisory activities (points c, d, e and l) awareness raising activities (points b and d), cooperation activities (points g and t), performing of activities and instruments envisaged in other Articles of the GDPR (points j to s), documentation requirements (point u), and monitoring of relevant developments that could have an impact on the protection of personal data (point i). [ 4 ] Albeit detailed the list of tasks is not closed, as some tasks are set out in other parts of the GDPR  (\" without prejudice to other tasks set out under this Regulation \"). An example thereof is drawing up of annual activity reports ( Article 59 GDPR) . It should be noted that that ensuring free flow of personal data is not entailed among the tasks of the SA. [ 5 ] Monitoring and enforcement of the GDPR are SA's main tasks. They summarise the core idea of SA's activities. All other tasks entailed in Article 57(1) GDPR can be understood as a manifestation of this general task. [ 6 ] Monitoring of the application of the GDPR refers to controlling controllers and processors and reviewing whether they comply with the GDPR. Monitoring includes data protection audits of controllers and processors, probes of compliance wit certain provisions of the GDPR or types of data processing and reviewing the certifications issued in accordance with Article 42(7) GDPR. When performing this task SA typically uses investigative powers from Article 58(1)(a)(b)(e)(f). [ 7 ] For example: A DPA starts a probe into video surveillance practices in supermarkets to determine whether controllers comply with the principles of lawfulness and data minimisation. [ 8 ] \"[...] it is important to note that, in accordance with Article 8(3) of the Charter and Article 51(1) and Article 57(1)(a) of the GDPR, the national supervisory authorities are responsible for monitoring compliance with the EU rules concerning the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data [...]\" CJEU - Joined Cases C\u201126/22 and C\u201164/22 - SCHUFA , margin number 55.. Enforcement of the application of the GDPR concerns the remedying of infringements of the GDPR that a SA has identified. [ 9 ] This means that when a SA determines that the GDPR has been applied incorrectly or not at all by a controller or processor, the SA should not stop there, but ensure compliance. Enforcement must be effective and, if necessary, coercive. Therefore SA should make use of its corrective powers under Article 58(2) GDPR . [ 10 ] This ranges from warning, to issuing a ban on processing and to the imposition of fines. SAs thus become effective supervisors with the possibility to intervene comprehensively. [ 10 ] Data protection law, even at the highest level, is of little use if it is not enforced. [ 11 ] For example: Company YX is transferring data to the US without a valid legal basis. After the SA has established the infringement of the GDPR it should ensure that the infringement stops and that the controller brings the processing of personal data in compliance with GDPR. This can be done by ordering return of data to the EU/EEA, banning future processing of respective data outside the EU/EEA and imposing a fine for\u00a8in the event, if YX does not comply with the order. The GDPR assigns the SAs the task of making the public aware of the risks associated with data processing and of safeguards and protections that the GDPR affords to data subjects and children. Informing the public is an important task of the SAs as the knowledge of the functions, possibilities and risks of data processing is limited in the general public. [ 12 ] Risks arise from the technical possibilities of accessing knowledge, but also from the consequences it can have on individuals and society when state, social or economic power obtains knowledge about people in an uncontrolled and asymmetrical manner. At the same time, only if data subjects are aware of the applicable data protection provisions provisions and the rights afforded to them, they can claim their rights and invoke violations. Promotion of public awareness can be an effective mean of raising the level of data protection. It can be done with educational events, conferences and also with annual reports that SAs are required to draw up under Article 59 GDPR . [ 13 ] With awareness raising also the visibility and presence of SAs can be strengthened. Only as publicly known bodies can the authorities effectively fulfil their task as 'independent guardians of the fundamental right to data protection' . [ 14 ] For example: A SA organises a public campaign \"know your rights\" on data subject\u2019s rights that includes visits of schools. This provision tasks SAs to provide general, preventive advice to public bodies on which measures should be taken to ensure an appropriate level of data protection. SAs should be consulted during preparation of laws and regulations, as well as administrative measures. In this regard Article 36(4) GDPR stipulates that Member States must consult the SA during the preparation of a legislative measure which relates to processing of personal data or of a regulatory measure based on such a legislative measure, which relates to processing. Which institutions and bodies are to be advised is determined by national laws of Member States. [ 15 ] For more information refer to Article 36(4) GDPR . For example: Estonia upgrades its e-governance system. The Estonian SA should be consulted in the process since the system introduces new technical solutions for processing of data. SAs should not only shed light on legislative proposals and administrative measures, but also on those actors whose actions are governed by the GDPR (controllers and processors). In practice, this task can be carried out, for example, through training courses, official statements as well as through direct exchange with the obligated parties in the event of obvious difficulties in interpreting of provisions. [ 16 ] For example: Organisation of workshops for data protection officers. In contrast to Article 57(1)(c) GDPR, which clearly mandates SAs to advise Member States and public sector bodies, this provision uses a different wording - \"promote awareness\". Similar wording is used in point (b) in relation to the general public - \"promote public awareness\". Consequently, this provision must be interpreted as mandating SAs to inform and educate controllers and processors in general. However, it cannot be interpreted as a mandate for the SAs to provide legal advice to controllers and processors in individual cases of data processing and, in particular, not to seek solutions together with controllers and processors on how to adjust a particular data processing that violates the GDPR to make it GDPR compliant in the context of complaints procedures or ex officio investigations instead of establishing a violation of the GDPR. SAs are tasked to provide specific guidance (\"upon request\") to data subjects with information about the exercise of their GDPR rights. These includes information regarding material rights, such as the right to be forgotten ( Article 17 GDPR ) and the right to compensation ( Article 82 GDPR ), as well as procedural rights and legal enforcement options, for instance, the rights mentioned in Article 77 GDPR , Article 78 GDPR and Article 80 GDPR ). [ 17 ] Article 57(1)(e) GDPR also refers to the fact that several SAs may have to work together to provide information to data subjects ( \"if appropriate, cooperate with the supervisory authorities in other Member States to that end\" ), for example in cross-border where the SA of the main or only establishment of the controller is charged with the investigation ( Article 56 GDPR and Article 60 GDPR ) and the SA  with which the complaint has been lodged with informing the complainant (on the progress and outcome of the complaint ( Article 77(2) GDPR ). [ 18 ] Example: Provide information in an email about the mandatory requirements of a complaint upon data subject's request. Handling of complaints is one of the main tasks of supervisory authorities. [ 19 ] \" This key duty of [SAs] corresponds with the right of data subjects pursuant to Article 77 [GDPR] to lodge a complaint with a [SA]. \" [ 20 ] SA's obligation to perform its task under Article 57(1)(f) GDPR is triggered by a complaint being filed with the SA. According to Article 77 GDPR the complaint can be lodged by a data subject or by a non-for-profit body on behalf of a data subject under Article 80 GDPR . When a SA obtains a complaint it must handle it. [ 21 ] SAs have the duty to handle each and every complaint submitted to them. [ 22 ] CJEU confirmed that complaints are not and cannot be treated as petitions. SAs are required to deal with them and sanction any violation of the GDPR in an appropriate manner. As the complaint is not a mere petition, a supervisory authority cannot invoke its discretion in not dealing with it, nor can postpone the handling in such a way that makes the right void of any substantial meaning. Lack of appropriate action by the supervisory authority or a substantial delay in handling a complaint thus constitute a violation of the principle of effectiveness and of the due diligence duty. [ 23 ] \"[\u2026] each supervisory authority is required on its territory to handle complaints which, in accordance with Article 77(1) of that regulation, any data subject is entitled to lodge where that data subject considers that the processing of his or her personal data infringes the regulation, and is required to examine the nature of that complaint as necessary. The supervisory authority must deal with such a complaint with all due diligence [\u2026].\" CJEU - Joined Cases C\u201126/22 and C\u201164/22 - SCHUFA , margin number 56.. The CJEU also confirmed that the complaints procedure, which is not similar to that of a petition, is designed as a mechanism capable of effectively safeguarding the rights and interests of data subjects. [ 23 ] GDPR does not define what constitutes a complaint. It only specifies the subject matter of a complaint. According to Article 77(1) GDPR the complaint concerns processing of personal data of the complainant which, in the complainant's view, infringes the GDPR. European Data Protection Board (\"EDPB\") indicates that a complaint may be defined as a submission to a SA by an identified natural person \u2013 or a not-for-profit body, organization or association that fulfils the conditions provided by Article 80 of the GDPR \u2013 who considers that the processing of personal data relating to him or her infringes the GDPR. [ 24 ] Consequently, complaints are not restricted to breaches of data subject's rights under Chapter III of the GDPR, but also concern any other violation of the data subject rights due to non-compliance with other obligations under the GDPR by the controller or processor . As the GDPR does not clarify what constitutes a complaint nor does it provide for the minimal requirements of a complaint, the elements that are required to be in a complaint for it to qualify as a complaint be admissible are determined by Member State law. Handling refers to the whole complaint procedure and thus covers all stages of the procedure, from checking of admissibility of the complaint and investigating its subject matter to taking a decision on the complaint and informing the data subject about the decision. When a complaint is lodged, the SA first proofs whether the complaint contains all elements that are required for it to be admissible under national law. [ 25 ] Second, the SA must identify which SA is competent to handle the complaint in accordance with Article 55 GDPR and in cross-border cases Article 56 GDPR and if applicable sent the complaint to the competent SA. This is done in the IMI system. [ 26 ] GDPR is regulating the procedure to a very limited extend. Articles 55 GDPR and 56(1) GDPR contain rules on competence and Articles 56 GDPR and 60 to 66 GDPR lay down a framework for handling of cross-border cases and cases with other transnational elements. [ 27 ] As the complaint procedure is mostly not regulated by the GDPR, complaints are handled under applicable national procedural rules. Some Member States have adopted procedural laws in other states the procedure is regulated by internal rules of procedure, depending on the Member State's legal order. In any case, as EDPB Internal Document 02/2021 clarifies, when handling a complaint SAs should always fulfil their procedural obligations under the GDPR, as well as adhere to other applicable rules and principles of EU law, such as the right to be heard (Article 41 CFR). [ 28 ] In the next step the competent SA has to investigate the subject matter of the complaint. This \"entails taking all necessary and appropriate steps with a view to resolving an issue or establishing whether an infringement has been committed and if so under what circumstances.\" The investigation can be carried out, for example, by hearing the person responsible, by on-site inspections or by researching the technical and other framework conditions ( Article 58(1) GDPR ). It is aimed at determining whether the processing and/or the handling of data subjects' rights is in compliance with the law. [ 29 ] But the subject matter of the complaint must be investigated with all due diligence. [ 30 ] Case law: In case C-362/14 - Schrems CJEU considered that where a person lodges with a SA a claim concerning the protection of his rights and freedoms in regard to the processing of his data it is incumbent upon the SA to examine the claim with all due diligence. [ 31 ] SAs are provided with a margin of discretion as regards the extent or depth of the investigation needed. A complaint must be investigated \"to the extent appropriate\u201d. Which investigatory steps are to be taken, depends on both the circumstances of the specific case and the requirements under national procedural law, but some degree of investigation must take place if the complaint is deemed admissible. [ 32 ] Example: When a complaint concerns processing of data without a legal basis through a website no on-site investigation is necessary. In the event that the subject matter of the complaint concerns non-compliance of video surveillance with GDPR requirements, an on-site visit can be very helpful or even necessary. According to EDPB necessary and appropriate steps encompass the measures (investigative powers) mentioned in Article 58 and among others include requesting information from the controller or processor and  carrying out an audit or on-site inspection. While a SA \"has a discretionary power to decide upon the necessary investigatory steps to be taken, including the extent and kind of information needed in order to provide a reply to the data subject and to decide on the necessity of enforcement action [...] [t]his discretionary power must be exercised with all due diligence. In all cases, the factual and legal issues raised by the complainant must be exemined\". [ 33 ] Case law: In Schrems II CJEU clarified that each supervisory authority is required to examine the nature of a complaint as necessary. The supervisory authority must deal with such a complaint with all due diligence. [ 34 ] Finally, for all admitted complaints that are not withdrawn, SAs must provide a decision or other legally attackable act specifying the facts and legal considerations for confirming the alleged infringements from the complaint or rejecting the complaint or dismissing the complaint (not investigating it further). [ 35 ] The SA where the complaint was lodged must inform the data subject of the outcome of the investigation. The controller or processor and the complainant have the right to appeal the decision of the SA in accordance with Article 78 GDPR . In case of an appeal SA's decision is subject to a full judicial review (see commentary to Article 78 GDPR). [ 36 ] Handling of a complaint should be performed within a reasonable period of time (see also Article 77(2) GDPR and Article 78 GDPR ). This reflects a fundamental duty of the SA to process complaints quickly and efficiently and to avoid lengthy proceedings. [ 37 ] Whether a reasonable time frame has been observed depends on the complexity of the case, as well as on the intensity of the infringement of the fundamental right, whereby it must also be taken into account whether the violation affects also rights of other data subjects. The aim is to prevent very long proceedings, including in transnational cases when further investigation or coordination with another SA is necessary. [ 38 ] Nevertheless, the reasonable period  will be somewhat longer if coordination with other SAs is needed, for example pursuant to Article 60 GDPR , in particular if there are reasoned objections from other supervisory authorities concerned and a binding decision of the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) needs to be adopted according to Article 65 GDPR . [ 39 ] Example: If it takes 6 years for a SA to investigate a complaint and take a final decision the complaint was not handled within a reasonable time. The provision must also be read in conjunction with Article 78 GDPR providing for a legal remedy against legally binding decisions of SAs (see above) and in case of inactivity of a SA. [ 40 ] For example, at the latest after three months, the complainant must at least be informed of the state of affairs. If this does not happen, he can file a legal remedy against the SA. SAs must share information and cooperate with other authorities in case a processing presents transnational profiles, including through the exchange of information and providing administrative assistance. Proactivity is required as SAs are under the obligation to contribute to the consistent application of the GDPR throughout the EU/EEA according to Article 51(2) GDPR . [ 41 ] GDPR provides rules on cooperation between SAs in Articles 60 to 66 and Article 56(2) to (5) . Duty to cooperate is not limited to cases of cross-border processing as per Article 4(21) GDPR . Example: Austrian SA asks the Danish SA to make an on-side inspection and seize data on controller's server located in Denmark. For more information on cooperation see commentary to Article 60 GDPR , Article 61 GDPR , Article 62 GDPR , Article 63 GDPR , Article 64 GDPR , Article 65 GDPR , Article 66 GDPR and Article 56 GDPR . The SA is also tasked to carry out investigations on its own initiative to ensure compliance with the GDPR. Investigations under Article 57(1)(h) GDPR can also be initiated based on information that the SA  obtained from another SA (e.g. in accordance with Article 60(1) GDPR and Article 61(1)GDPR ), another national authority (e.g. a competition SA, consumer protection or telecommunications authority) or from any other source. [ 42 ] However if a complaint was filed, the SA must exemine the complaint in a complaint procedure. At the European level, Article 46(b) of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 contains a similar ex officio duty of investigation for the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS). [ 43 ] Example: A SA initiates an ex officio investigation, after a research study by a NGO reveals that cars are sharing unlimited data with car producers, including video and audio of the driver and passengers. Another activity SAs are tasked with is to follow any development relevant to data protection field. In particular, the SA must follow new communication technologies and business practices. This includes new invasive processing methods, for example in the areas of big data, pattern recognition and internet surveillance, as well as technical developments that can be used to ensure data protection requirements, such as options for separate data storage, encryption and pseudonymisation, and use of secure networks. SAs should also be aware of new trends in processing of personal data for purposes of advertising, pay-or-ok solutions, and the use of new consent and contract clauses. [ 44 ] Following relevant developments seems also to be necessary in order to adequately carry out the other tasks, particularly monitoring and advice. [ 45 ] Example: SA should react when social networks start using pay-or-ok solutions. Under Article 57(1)(j) SA are given the task to adopt standard contractual clauses as laid down in Article 28(8) GDPR and Article 46(2)(d) GDPR . Both cases require activity by the EDPB, within the consistency mechanism under Article 63 GDPR or by adopting an opinion under Article 64(1)(d) GDPR . For more information see commentary to Article 28(8) GDPR and Article 46(2)(d) GDPR . Every SA has to establish and maintain a list of the processing operations for which a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) must always be carried out ( Article 35(4) GDPR ). On the other hand, maintaining a negative list for cases where a DPIA is not needed is not a mandatory task . [ 46 ] According to Article 35(5) GDPR , a SA can also establish and make public a list of the kind of processing operations for which no data protection impact assessment is required. These lists are to be submitted to the EDPB. For more information, please refer to Article 35 GDPR . Advising controllers and processors with regard to high-risk processing operations referred to in Article 36(2) GDPR is one of the tasks of SAs.  This includes receiving and reviewing the data protection impact assessment notified to it and advising the controller in accordance with Article 36(2) GDPR , in particularly making proposals to mitigate the risk. [ 47 ] SA can also make use of any of its powers referred to in Article 58 GDPR . This includes its corrective powers, in particularly, if the written recommendations of the SA are not taken into account and the controller or processor continuously fails to properly identify and mitigate the risk. [ 48 ] For more details see commentary to Article 36 GDPR . SAs have the task of promoting development of codes of conduct by associations and other organisations representing categories of controllers or processors pursuant to Article 40(1) GDPR . SA receives the draft, examines it, issues opinions on the question if it is compatible with the GDPR and, if so, approves it. [ 49 ] See comment under Article 40 GDPR . This task is directly connected with Article 42(1) GDPR that stipulates that SAs are to encourage the establishment of data protection certification mechanisms and of data protection seals and marks, for the purpose of demonstrating compliance of processing operations by controllers and processors with the GDPR. The SA is also to issue certifications and approve criteria according to which the process to be certified is to be examined  pursuant to Article 42(5) GDPR . [ 50 ] See comment under Article 42 GDPR . This task is further specified in Article 42 GDPR . A SA must periodically review the certifications granted under Article 42 GDPR (see also point (n) above), which is followed by a renewal or withdrawal of the certification in accordance with Article 42(7) GDPR . [ 51 ] For more information see comment under Article 42 GDPR . Tis task concerns codes of conduct under Article 41 GDPR and certifications under Article 43 GDPR , which can be approved and issued by bodies other than SAs. These bodies require accreditation for this purpose. The SA determines and publishes the requirements these bodies must fulfil for accreditation. [ 52 ] See also commentary to Article 41 GDPR and Article 43 GDPR . SAs are tasked to carry out the accreditation of a body for monitoring of compliance with a code of conduct pursuant to Article 41 GDPR and a certification body pursuant to Article 43 GDPR on the basis of the requirements formulated under Article 57(1)(p) (see point (p) above). For more information see also comments under Article 41 GDPR and Article 43 GDPR . Similarly, SAs are in charge of authorisation of contractual clauses and provisions referred to in Article 46(3) GDPR providing a legal basis for transfers of data to third countries (outside EU/EEA) or to international organisations. See comment under Article 46 GDPR . This task concerns the role of SAs assigned to them by Article 47 GDPR with regard to binding corporate rules for internal transfers of data outside EU/EEA within one group of undertakings or group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, which have to be approved by a SAs. See commentary to Article 47 GDPR . Pursuant to Article 57(1)(t) GDPR SAs contribute to the activities of the EDPB ( \"the Board\" ). The concept of contributions is to be understood comprehensively. It refers among other to the entire coherence procedure (Articles 63 to 66 GDPR), as well as to the numerous tasks of the EDPB. [ 53 ] EDPB's tasks are listed in Article 70 GDPR and include, in particular, the preparation and publication of opinions, guidelines, recommendations and best practices. The SAs should actively contribute to the fulfilment of these tasks. This concerns both the meetings of the EDPB itself and their preparation, in particular within the framework of expert subgroups. [ 54 ] The EDPB itself has the task of promoting cooperation and exchange between data protection supervisory authorities. [ 55 ] Furthermore, SAs have the task of keeping internal records of infringements of the GDPR and measures taken against controllers and processors under Article 58(2) GDPR , which lays down corrective powers of SAs. The content of internal records is not further specified. It seems that a bullet point description of the infringements and the type of measures taken (e.g. warning, reprimand, orders, imposition of fines) would be sufficient. It is not mandatory to include the amount of fines imposed. The records can be used as a basis for the activity report ( Article 59 GDPR ) and for diverse advisory tasks of the SAs. It can also be used to make strategic decisions on the future direction of SA's activities, its effectiveness, cooperation with other SAs and to follow general developments. [ 56 ] Finally, Article 57(1)(v) GDPR constitutes the residual provision for all \u201c other tasks related to the protection of personal data \u201d. The list of tasks is therefore not exhaustive and Member States can provide for further tasks in national law. However, these should be chosen carefully with a view to the respective financial resources and the already far-reaching tasks. [ 57 ] An example of other tasks is the prior authorisation of data processing in the public interest if required under national law ( Article 36(5) GDPR and Article 58(3)(c) GDPR ). [ 58 ] The wording ( \"on its territory\") is intended to clarify that the tasks of the supervisory authority do not extend beyond the territory of its Member State. [ 59 ] Article 57(2) GDPR provides for facilitation of the filing of a complaint on the formal side. [ 60 ] This means that the SA should be able to provide simple and intuitive solutions for uploading and filing the complaint as well as relevant attachments. The provision expressly mentions a \u201c complaint submission form \u201d which should be easy to understand and gain access to. [ 61 ] The provision of a complaint form is a variant for making the submission of complaints unbureaucratic and simple. It can also make it easier for the SA to fulfil its tasks because it can use standardisation to make the complaints procedure more effective. The design of a complaints form can provide the complainant with instructions on how to complete the form, which makes the work of the SA easier and keeps the need for queries in limits. For example, it can be listed which information is required on the respondent and the subject of the complaint and which evidence, if any, may be relevant. [ 62 ] The provision, however, does not exclude \u201c other means of communications \u201d, such as the e-mail. In order to facilitate the filing, the SA\u2019s IT systems should be able to receive the complaints with the least number of obstacles possible. It should allow the upload of the most commonly used file formats and avoid setting unreasonable restrictions on the amount of files that can be uploaded and their dimension. [ 63 ] Additionally, data subject's right to file a complaint and seek protection following an infringement of the GDPR is widely mentioned and protected throughout the GDPR. Data subjects are informed about the existence of the right to complaint ( Article12(4) GDPR and Article 13(2)(d)(e) GDPR ). The SAs deal with every complaint, investigating it to an appropriate extent and informing the complainant about the progress and result of the investigation (Article 57(1)(f) GDPR). Data subject can lodge a complaint with a SA of his choice ( Article 77 GDPR ). [ 64 ] \"[T]he obligation on the part of the supervisory authorities to facilitate the lodging of complaints, and the principle that the tasks they must perform are free of charge, laid down in Article 57(2) and (3) of the GDPR, are intended to enable any data subject to seek from a supervisory authority enforcement of the rights he or she derives from that regulation.\" CJEU - C\u2011416/23 - \u00d6sterreichische Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rde , margin number 39. The right to file a complaint is granted free of charge. This supports the idea of data protection as a fundamental right that must be enforced without undue hindrance by both controllers and SAs. On the other side, since controllers and processors are not mentioned, it seems reasonable to conclude that the SA may charge them with some fees for the performance of their tasks. [ 65 ] However, SAs should take into account that the performance of tasks free of charge, including where controllers and processors are involved, can encourage them to consult with the SA regarding their processing activities and thus contribute to GDPR-compliant processing. [ 66 ] Article 57(4) GDPR provides for an exception to the ' free of charge ' principle and the SA's obligation to handle requests (e.g. complaints by data subjects), if the requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular if they are repetitive. In these cases, the SA may charge a reasonable fee or refuse to act on the request. Therefore, this provision reflects the general legal principle that EU law cannot be relied on for abusive or fraudulent ends. [ 67 ] In the absence of a definition in the GDPR, the term 'request' is - in accordance with its usual meaning in everyday language - a very broad term that encompasses a wide variety of acts by which a person or entity asks for something. Specifically, complaints lodged under Article 77(1) GDPR fall within the meaning of a 'request'. [ 68 ] Neither 'manifestly unfounded' nor 'excessive' is defined in the GDPR and need to be interpreted in the light of their context and the objectives pursued by the the provision. [ 69 ] It should be noted that a large number of complaints by a single data subject does not make the respective numerous requests excessive. A data subject might file a large number of complaints because they were subject of numerous GDPR violations. Then all the complaints are justified and they cannot be considered excessive. [ 70 ] For example: A data subject might requests access under Article 15 GDPR from a number of controllers which process their personal data. If a vast amount of controller fail to accuratly respond to the access requests it is justified to file a fast amount of complaints under Article 77 GDPR against those controllers. Therefore, in the case of complaints in accordance with Article 77 GDPR, the number of requests by a data subject is not a decisive factor in the assessment, whether a request is excessive - even if Article 57(4) specifically mentions the \"repetitive character\" of an request. Rather, a SA has to asses if the data subject has an abusive intention . This could be the case if a data subject does not file complaints in order to obtain protection of their rights under the GDPR but with the intention to interfere with the proper functioning of the SA by taking up its resources. An indication of such a conduct would be that a data subject submits a vast amount of complaints against controllers, they have no connection to. [ 71 ] \"[W]here [a SA] seeks to make use of the possibility offered by Article 57(4) of the GDPR, the supervisory authority concerned must establish, having regard to all the relevant circumstances of each case, that there has been an abusive intention on the part of the person in question, the number of complaints made by that person being, in itself, insufficient. A finding of an abusive intention may be made if a person has lodged complaints in circumstances where it was not objectively necessary to do so in order to protect his or her rights under that regulation.\" CJEU - C\u2011416/23 - \u00d6sterreichische Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rde , margin number 50. In case of manifestly unfounded or excessive requests, the SA may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs, or refuse to act on the request. The wording of this provision suggests that there is no order between these two options and the SA can freely choose between these options. [ 72 ] However, SAs should consider all the relevant circumstances and chose the option that is appropriate, necessary and proportionate. [ 73 ] Specifically, the SA should consider, that the refusal to act on an request, generally, has a more severe consequence for the person making the request. \"[T]he supervisory authorities could consider charging, initially, a reasonable fee based on administrative costs before subsequently refusing to act on the complaints, in so far as the first of those measures has less of an adverse effect on the rights that data subjects derive from that regulation than the second. That said, Article 57(4) of that regulation does not entail an obligation on the supervisory authority in all cases first to apply the option of charging a reasonable fee.\" CJEU - C\u2011416/23 - \u00d6sterreichische Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rde , margin number 69. Article 57(4) GDPR aims to prevent the activity of a SA from being seriously impaired or even paralysed by troublemakers who make nonsensical or repeated requests. However, since the task of the SAs is to protect fundamental rights, this exception rule may only be used in clearly defined situations. [ 74 ] The above exception may limit the protection of the data subject's right to file a complaint. For this reason, Article 57(4) GDPR provides that the SA bears the burden of proof and must demonstrate that a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 57 GDPR \u2191 Ziebarth, in Sydow, Marsch, DS-GVO/BDSG, Article 57 GDPR, margin number 1 (Nomos 2022). \u2191 See Zerdick , in Kuner, Bygrave, Docksey, The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): A Commentary, Article 57 GDPR, p. 929 (Oxford University Press 2020). \u2191 Eichler , in Wolff/Brink, BeckOK DatenschutzR, Article 57 GDPR, margin numbers 1-3 (C.H.

Each supervisory authority shall have all of the following investigative powers: 2.   Each supervisory authority shall have all of the following corrective powers: 3.   Each supervisory authority shall have all of the following authorisation and advisory powers: 4.   The exercise of the powers conferred on the supervisory authority pursuant to this Article shall be subject to appropriate safeguards, including effective judicial remedy and due process, set out in Union and Member State law in accordance with the Charter. 5.   Each Member State shall provide by law that its supervisory authority shall have the power to bring infringements of this Regulation to the attention of the judicial authorities and where appropriate, to commence or engage otherwise in legal proceedings, in order to enforce the provisions of this Regulation. 6.   Each Member State may provide by law that its supervisory authority shall have additional powers to those referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3. The exercise of those powers shall not impair the effective operation of Chapter VII. Article 58 GDPR standardises the powers that supervisory authorities (\u201c SAs \u201d) can use in performing their tasks under Article 57 GDPR . The provision includes a comprehensive catalogue of investigative, corrective and advisory powers. Such powers result directly from the GDPR and therefore do not need implementation by member states\u2019 law. Under Article 70(1)(k) GDPR , the EDPB should in principle adopt guidelines regarding the concrete and consistent application of such powers. [ 1 ] In this regard, all the SA\u2019s powers are important. However, under Article 83(5)(e) GDPR, non-compliance with an order or a temporary or definitive limitation on processing or the suspension of data flows by the SA pursuant to Article 58(2) GDPR or failure to provide access in violation of Article 58(1) GDPR, may result in the highest fines possible. [ 2 ] It seems, therefore, that the legislator considers some of the powers described in Article 58 GDPR to be crucial for the functioning of SAs and, in turn, the entire GDPR system. A necessary step to enforcing the GDPR and handling data subjects\u2019 complaints is the possibility of carrying out investigations. Article 58(1) GDPR differentiates between different types of investigative powers. This powers are needed to establish the facts of a case. [ 3 ] Only on the basis of a comprehensive clarification of the facts of the case the SA is in a position to exercise its corrective powers under Article 58(2) GDPR or its authorisation powers under Article 58(3) GDPR. [ 4 ] SAs can combine several invegistative powers according to the needs of the investigation. To grant an example, the SA may link the data protection audit to further powers under paragraph 1, such as the access powers to obtain access to personal data processed, to information and to the premesis under Article 58(1)(e)(f) GDPR. The SA can instruct the controller, processor and, if applicable, the representative to provide all information that is necessary for the performance of their tasks. The obligation to provide the information relates to all information (knowledge) that is at ones disposal in any form, e.g. in written, visual, audio or data processing form, as well as data stored or accessible in other information media. It is intended to prevent that only individual pieces of information are provided to the SA during the investigation. [ 5 ] Information includes the personal data processed, but also the information on the purpose, nature and methods of processing, origin and recipients of the data, contracts, certifications. In cases of cross-border processing information and evidence may also be important as to which of several establishments is the main establishment ( Article 56 GDPR in connection with Article 4(16) GDPR ). [ 6 ] Information can be provided, for example, by transmitting documents to the SA, submitting written statements or replying to questionnaires. In addition to this, Article 30(4) GDPR stipulates that the controller or processor or, if applicable, the representative shall make the record of processing activities available to the SA on request. [ 7 ] Example: xxx Where the controller or processor would incriminate themselves by providing certain information and thus be subject to sanctions, they can invoke their right to refuse information based on the rule of law clause in Article 58(4) GDPR (see bellow) and the privilege against self-incrimination ( nemo tenetur principle). [ 8 ] Example: xxxx The SAs can carry out investigations in the form of audits of data protection and of data security. [ 9 ] An audit implies that a comprehensive qualitative examination of the effectiveness of procedures is conducted. [ 10 ] In this context SAs can take different measures to analyse processing operations on personal data at a controller or processor, such as access to documents, the examination of hardware and software used, networks, databases, applications, interfaces, as well as the testing of security measures found or the evaluation of data records. [ 11 ] The initial version of Article 58 GDPR limited the scope of the audit to the business premises of the controller. After the Corrigendum of the GDPR, [ 12 ] however, the term \u201c business premises \u201d was replaced by \u201c premises \u201d. It follows that private rooms, where at least a part of the processing takes place, are also included. [ 13 ] Under Article 58(1)(c) GDPR a SA can review certifications issued in accordance with Article 42(7) GDPR when they are being renewed as well as the activities of accredited certification bodies within the meaning of Article 43(1) GDPR . During the review the SA is exemining whether the requirements of certification are still met. [ 14 ] In accordance with Article 58(1)(d) GDPR, a SA can inform a controller or processor about an alleged \u2013 i.e. possible, but not yet determined \u2013 infringement of the GDPR ('Regulation'). Such a notice can be given, for example, directly in connection with a data protection audit, a data subject\u2019s complaint or official information from another SA. The notice establishes a presumption of a violation of the GDPR, which, however, can be rejected by the controller or the processor. [ 15 ] This appears to be a constructive and proportional approach which gives controllers and processors a chance to know the provisional understanding of the SA and react accordingly, making submissions and/or bringing the processing into compliance, if a violation exists. The powers of investigation of the SAs also include a right of access to personal data and information in accordance with Article 58(1)(e) GDPR. This includes the right to directly access personal data, inspect internal documents, databases and procedures, and therefore is wider and more incisive than the right to (request and) obtain information under Article 58(1)(a) GDPR. SAs can obtain access to documents and systems on site and/or to connect into the processing systems. [ 16 ] SAs are also authorised to record the technical and organisational background of data processing, which means that all documents on procedures and security documentation are subject to access, including technical information on systems which do not yet process personal data, but which may enable a link with or to personal data. [ 17 ] Controllers and processors must cooperate with the SA during the inspection ( Article 31 GDPR ). However, if the cooperation yields a violation of the nemo tenetur principle (privilege against self-incrimination), it seems possible for the investigated party to lawfully refuse such cooperation. [ 18 ] Failure to provide access can pursuant to Article 83(5)(e) GDPR result in an administrative fine of up to 20 000 000 EUR or up to 4\u00a0% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Finally, data protection SAs \u2013 similarly to the Commission and the national competition authorities in EU antitrust proceedings \u2013 are given the power to search the controller\u2019s (or processor\u2019s) premises in accordance with Article 58(1)(f) GDPR. The search is not restricted to the business premises but a judge\u2019s authorization is indispensable with regard to the inviolability of the home and comparable places. [ 19 ] The term \u201cpremises\u201d includes all data processing systems and all data processing devices. Member States might adopt special provisions in relation to controllers or processors that are subject to an obligation of professional secrecy or other equivalent obligations of secrecy with regard to SAs authorisation to access under Article 58(1)(e)(f) GDPR ( Article 90(1) GDPR ). Example: The Norvegian SA enters the premises and is granted access to the data base of a Norvegian company during an investigation. The corrective powers provided for in Article 58(2) GDPR enable the SAs to restore GDPR-compliant conditions in the event of violations. For this purpose, Article 58(2) GDPR builds a system of powers which should be proportionally used having in mind the type of the envisaged violation and the risks for the data subjects. \u201cWhere, following its investigation, such an authority finds an infringement of the provisions of that regulation, it is required to react appropriately in order to remedy the shortcoming found. To that end, Article 58(2) of that regulation lists the various corrective measures that the supervisory authority may adopt [...].\u201d CJEU - Joined Cases C\u201126/22 and C\u201164/22 - SCHUFA , margin number 57. The GDPR leaves the SA a discretion as to the manner in which it must remedy any violation found. Thus, the SA must determine which action is appropriate and necessary, and must do so taking into consideration all the circumstances of the specific case as well as its responsibility to ensure that the GDPR is fully enforced with all due diligence. [ 20 ] In doing so, a SA has to decide at its due discretion whether exercising a milder remedial power (e.g. a warning) is sufficient to ensure the application and enforcement of the GDPR, or whether a more profound measure (e.g. a ban of on a processing activity) should be administered. SAs are generally required to take action and use one or more of the corrective powers provided for in Article 58(2) GDPR whenever it is necessary to remedy a violation or when it is appropriate to ensure that that regulation is fully enforced. However, in exceptional cases SAs might have discretion whether to exercise corrective powers. This is might be the case when the GDPR violation has already been remedied and the processing of personal data is already brought into compliance with the GDPR. Additionally, such non-action must not undermine the consistent and high level of protection of personal data through strong enforcement of the GDPR. [ 21 ] \"In that regard, it cannot be ruled out that, exceptionally and in the light of the particular circumstances of the specific case, the supervisory authority may refrain from exercising a corrective power even though a breach of personal data has been established. That could be the case, inter alia, where the breach established has not continued, for example where the controller, which had, in principle, implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures within the meaning of Article 24 of the GDPR, has, as soon as it became aware of that breach, taken appropriate and necessary measures to ensure that that breach is brought to an end and does not recur, in view of its obligations under, inter alia, Article 5(2) and Article 24 of that regulation.\" CJEU - C-768/21 - Land Hessen , margin number 43. The SA's decision whether and how to use its corrective powers is subject to full judicial review in accordance with Article 79 GDPR. [ 22 ] Article 83(5)(e) and Article 83(6) GDPR stipulate that non-compliance with an order or a temporary or definitive limitation on processing or the suspension of data flows can be punished with up to \u20ac20,000,000 EUR or in the case of an undertaking, up to 4\u00a0% of the total worldwide annual turnover. The mildest expression of the authority\u2019s powers is the warning. The SA issues it if an intended processing operation is \u201c likely \u201d to violate the GDPR. A warning can be issued in cases where the processing has not started yet but is \"intended\". There are no specifics as to the form of the warning. It follows that it can be issued in writing or orally (although a formal approach appears sensible). The controller can react to a warning by redesigning the intended processing operation in a manner that makes it compliant with the law. [ 23 ] Example: The Danish SA issues a written warning to a Danish company that their intended data base is likely to violate the GDPR unless they they implement measures to mitigate risks, such as data encryption, after the Danish company seems to be ignoring the written advice provided in prior consultations under Article 36 GDPR, and plans to proceed with the intended processing without implementing all the adjustments that the Danish SA had identified as necessary. If the SA identifies a violation of the GDPR, it may, under Article 58(2)(b) GDPR, issue a reprimand to a controller or a processor. Contrary to what happens in case of a warning, the reprimand indicates that one (or more rarely, several) violation of the GDPR has already occurred and has been established by the SA. The SA will issue a reprimand if the threshold for imposing a fine has not yet been reached. For these reasons, scholars have defined the reprimand as the \u201c little sister of the fine \u201d or compared it to a \u201cyellow card\u201d from the SA. [ 24 ] However, if a reprimand is disregarded, the SA can respond by exercising more stringent remedial powers and taking into account the conduct as a factor for a possible administrative fine ( Article 83 GDPR ). Example: xxxx Article 58(2)(c) GDPR serves as a second-level remedy in case a controller or processor violates the rights of the data subject. Should that happen, the SA can then instruct the controller or the processor to comply with the data subject\u2019s request, such as with regard to the right to access ( Article 15 GDPR ), rectification ( Article 16 GDPR ), erasure ( Article 17 GDPR ), restriction ( Article 18 GDPR ), notification ( Article 19 GDPR ) or data portability (Article 20 GDPR). In these cases, the SA acts through an \u201c order \u201d. [ 25 ] Example: The Bavarian SA orders a company to provide to the complainant a full copy of all of her data that they are processing within 10 days after it has received the order. The SA can instruct the controller or processor to bring processing operations in line with the GDPR. Adjusment of processing to become GDPR compliant can be required in a specific manner and within a specific period of time. The order must always be sufficiently specific in terms of content. The controller must be able to understand what is required of them, so that they can act accordingly. If there are several options for bringing the processing in compliance with the requirements of the GDPR, the order must be written in a manner that the controller will be in a position to choose any of the options. The order must not be restricted to a certain option in such situations for reasons of proportionality. If, for example, several equally efficient encryption methods exist according to the state of the art, it must be examined whether the order can leave the choice of the specific method to the controller. [ 26 ] Otherwise, there is no limit to the type of instruction. The wording of the law appears to authorise any request that could serve the scope of (re-)establishing GDPR compliance. Measures include, for example, instructions to take technical and organisational measures within the meaning of Article 32 GDPR , to appoint a data protection officer according to Article 37 GDPR , to create and maintain a record of processing activities according to Article 30 GDPR , to regulate the relationship with a processor by means of a contract or other binding legal act ( Article 28(3) GDPR ), to change the alignment of surveillance cameras, or to change the use of pre-formulated consent within the meaning of Article 7 GDPR . [ 27 ] Example: xxxx According to Article 58(2)(e) GDPR of the GDPR, the SA can instruct the controller to immediately notify persons affected by a data breach which triggers the notification obligations under Article 33 GDPR and Article 34 GDPR . This provision is closely connected to Article 34(4) GDPR that clarifies that the SA can require the controller to comunicate a personal data breach to a data subject, if it considers that the data breach is resulting in a high risk. The order is always addressed to the controller as controllers are obliged to inform data subjects of a data breach also, if the data breach occured on the side of the processor ( Article 33(1)(2) GDPR ). [ 28 ] Example: xxx The SA can also order a limitation or ban on data processing in accordance with Article 58(2)(f) GDPR. The limitation on data processing can be temporary or permanent.  A ban does not only limit but prohibits processing completely. In case of a ban the limitation not only concern certain data, processing purposes or a certain duration, but the processing as a whole is prohibited. For example, a ban of processing will be ordered if certain processing with a specific service provider cannot be organised in compliance with the GDPR. [ 29 ] These measures are strict and should be considered only as long as and to the extent that it is necessary and proportionate. In particularly, in the case of a ban as a particularly invasive measure, the SA must always check whether milder, equally suitable means are available, such as a limitation of processing. A ban on processing should be the last resort. [ 30 ] At the same time, however, the ban will be a proportionate or sometimes even the only effective means, in particular in cases where it is impossible for the controller or processor to establish legal compliance for a processing operation. For example, if the processing takes place without a legal basis ( Article 6 GDPR ), the conditions for consent in accordance with Article 7 GDPR cannot be met in relation to the processing operation or no suitable technical and organisational measures in accordance with Article 32 GDPR can be implemented in accordance with the state of the art. Moreover, it is at the discretion of the SA whether it prefers an immediate remedy to a delayed adjustment. [ 31 ] A ban is to be considered also when controller or processor has shown a particularly disrespectful conduct, as it happens when a previous warning, reprimand or order has been issued and the recipient has disregarded it. [ 32 ] For example, the Norvegian SA imposed a temporary ban on processing of data for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram for Noway, after Meta failed to comply with the decison of the Irish SA adopted under the Article 60 GDPR mechanism and  bring cross-border processing for behavioral advertising  on Facebook and Instagram in line with the GDPR within the set time limit. [ 33 ] Both decisions are under appeal. The ban was extended to the whole EU/EEA by a EDPB Urgent Binding Decision adopted under Article 66 GDPR instructing the Irish SA as the LSA to take, within two weeks, final measures regarding Meta and to impose a ban on the processing of personal data for behavioural advertising on the legal bases of contract and legitimate interest across the entire EEA. [ 34 ] In general, the unlawfulness of the processing is a condition for a limitation or ban of processing by a SA. However, in exceptional cases where the (un)lawfulness is not yet established (certain), but the risk for the data subjects is high, presumably unlawful processing can be limited or banned until the question of lawfulness of such processing has been clarified. [ 35 ] Article 58(2)(g) GDPR authorises the SA to order a correction  or deletion of data ( Article 16 GDPR , Article 17 GDPR ) or a restriction of data processing ( Article 18 GDPR ), provided that the conditions for the measure laid down in respective Article are fulfilled. The SA can intervene ex officio. A prior request of the data subject or a complaint is not necessary. [ 36 ] In addition, the SA can order that the controller has to notify the recipients of data that the data has been rectified, erased or the processing thereof had been restricted ( Article 17(2) GDPR and Article 19 GDPR ). The addressee of the order is always the controller, as the rights listed in Article 58(2)(g) GDPR apply only to controllers. [ 37 ] If a SA comes to the conclusion that the prerequisites of a previously issued certification are no longer met, it might, in accordance with Article 42(7) GDPR , revoke the certification. If the certification is granted by a certification body, the SA can do so in accordance with Article 58(2) GDPR and instruct the body to revoke the certification or not to issue it. Correspondingly, Article 43(1) GDPR provides for an obligation of the certification bodies to inform the SA in order to allow it to exercise its powers before the body issues or renews a certificate. [ 38 ] Under Article 43(2)(c) GDPR every certification body must have their own procedures for review and revocation of certifications. The aim of this provision is that the SA intervenes in the event that it has justified doubts about the independence and credibility of a certification body so that procedures, products and services can no longer benefit from the sales-promoting effect of the certification. [ 39 ] The most renowned (although probably not most important) remedy introduced by the GDPR is the imposition of a fine under Article 58(2) GDPR in conjunction with Article 83 GDPR . Their amount, which can go to up to EUR 20 million or, if superior, up to 4\u00a0% of the undertaking\u2019s total worldwide annual turnover, is determined taking into account the type of violation ( Article 83(4)(5) GDPR ) as well as other qualitative factors listed in Article 83(2) GDPR , in particular according to the type, gravity and duration of the infringement. The SA can, but does not have to, impose fines for violations. The relevant decision is at the discretion of the SA, whereby the considerations mentioned in Article 83 GDPR are to be taken into account. The fine can be imposed in addition to or instead of further remedial measures within the meaning of Article 58(2)(a)-(h) GDPR. [ 40 ] Case law:  \u00c5kerberg Fransson ECJ ruling shows that the principle ne bis in idem does not apply if a measure with a punitive nature is imposed in addition to one without a punitive nature. It is therefore permissible to impose a fine alongside an administrative measure that is not punitive. [ 41 ] A final remedy is provided for in Article 58(2)(j) GDPR. According to this, a SA can order the suspension of data transfer to a third country or to an international organisation if the third country or international organisation concerned does not or no longer offers an appropriate level of protection within the meaning of Article 45 GDPR . The authorisation and advisory powers in Article 58(3) GDPR supplement the investigative and corrective measures SAs are afforded with. Article 58(3) GDPR lists all those cases in which authorisation or approval from a SA is a prerequisite for acting in accordance with the GDPR. In these cases, the SA carries out a prior check in order to preventively ensure the application and enforcement of the GDPR. In detail, this concerns the following powers (cf. Article 58(3)(c)-(j) GDPR): Approval of processing that is particularly risky for the fundamental data protection right, provided that a member state has made use of the optional specification clause ( Article 36(5) GDPR ); Opinion on and approval of drafts for rules of conduct in accordance with Article 40(5) GDPR and, where relevant, Article 64(1)(b) GDPR ; Accreditation of certification bodies in accordance with Article 43 GDPR ; Issuing of certifications in accordance with Article 42(5), if relevant, in accordance with Article 64(1)(c) GDPR ; Standard contractual clauses in accordance with Article 28(8) GDPR and, if the case, Article 46(2) GDPR ; Approval of standard contractual clauses for international data transfer in accordance with Article 46(3)(a) GDPR and Article 64(1)(e) GDPR ; Approval of administrative agreements for international data transfer in accordance with Article 46(3) (b) GDPR ; Approval of binding corporate rules in accordance with Article 47 GDPR . In the absence of a uniform European administrative procedural law, the powers of the SAs must in principle be exercised in accordance with the national procedural law of the respective member state. National procedural law must meet certain requirements; in particular, it must provide for due process and effective judicial remedies. [ 42 ] Article 58(5) GDPR contains an opening clause that must be filled out by the legislators of the member states. According to this, SAs must always have the power to bring violations of the GDPR to court. Specifying national legal provisions must decide whether a SA itself has a right of action or whether it has to involve the national judicial authorities, which in turn have to initiate judicial proceedings. The GDPR allows the member states to insert the enforcement powers of the national SAs into the national legal system. According to Article 58(6) GDPR, each member state can stipulate that its SA receives further powers in addition to those mentioned in paragraphs 1-3, provided that this not impair the effective implementation of Chapter VII of the GDPR on cooperation and coherence. Based on the express wording of paragraph 6, it can be assumed that the SAs may be given additional powers, but that the existing powers may not be restricted. A contrary view cannot be derived from any other provision of the GDPR.

3.2 Adressees of the report 3.1 Contents of the report 3.2 Adressees of the report 4 Decisions 5 References Each supervisory authority shall draw up an annual report on its activities, which may include a list of types of infringement notified and types of measures taken in accordance with Article 58(2). Those reports shall be transmitted to the national parliament, the government and other authorities as designated by Member State law. They shall be made available to the public, to the Commission and to the Board. No recitals seem to be available for this provision. The main goal of the activity reports regulated by Article 59 GDPR consists of informing national and EU authorities as well as the larger public about the activities the supervisory authority ( SA ) has performed over the previous year. The obligation of SAs to submit an annual report thus primarily serves to ensure democratic control and transparency. [ 1 ] Case law: The CJEU in Commission v Germany, considered tha the obligation of independent SAs to regularly submit and publish a report on their activities, provided for in Article 28(5) of the Data Protection Directive, to be part of the accountability required by the principle of democracy as a counterpart to complete independence of SAs. [ 2 ] The activity report can also contribute to a harmonised and consistent implementation and enforcement of the GDPR across the EEA and to developing a common opinion among different SAs over new or contentious data protection issues. Additionally, the reports can be a good reference point for data protection officers. If a breach has occurred in processing by other controller, possibly even in the same sector, it may be a good idea to check the proccessing in one's own organisation in this regard as well. The activity reports usually also contain information on how a measure can be implemented in compliance with the law. Finally, the reports can also help to avoid unnecessary costs (in private detectives, video cameras, etc.), if the practice is considered illegal by the SA. Similarly, the reports help everyone to assert their rights as data subjects, as they often raise awareness of the situations in which data processing is (un)permissible. [ 3 ] The wording does not impose the authority a tight constraint in terms of contents. In the black-letter of the law, the report \u201d may include a list of types of infringement notified and types of measures taken in accordance with Article 58(2) [GDPR] \u201d. These is a reference to the information that SAs must keep in internal records according to Article 57(1)(u) GDPR . [ 4 ] The report may include that information but if it does not, it is unlikely to be invalid. However, the report cannot end up resulting in a sterile formalistic exercise, carrying no substantive information. This would conflict with the accountability and transparency purpose enshrined by the provision itself and should therefore be avoided. [ 5 ] The report is to be transmitted to the national parliament, the government and other authorities as designated by member state law. In addition to transparency and accountability of SAs, the report is a source of information for legislators in the further development of data protection law. [ 6 ] Furthermore, the report must be made available to the public, the Commission and the EDPB (\" the Board \"). In this context, SAs must send the report to the Commission and the EDPB, wherea publication on a website will be sufficient to fulfil the obligation towards the public.\u00a0 Making the report accessible to the EDPB will enable the other SAs to take note of it and thus enable a uniform interpretation and and enforcement of the GDPR.

Personal data shall be: 2. The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (\u2018 accountability \u2019). The principles have a long legal history and are based on the principles in Article 5 of Convention 108 from 1981. Following this tradition, Article 5 GDPR is also largely consistent with Article 6(1) of the previous Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. Some of the principles are also reflected in Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (EU Charter), other principles can be seen as a logical consequence of the proportionality test under the Charter. Article 5 GDPR sets out all the principles for processing personal data: lawfulness, fairness and transparency; purpose limitation; data minimisation; accuracy; storage limitation; integrity and confidentiality; accountability. Many of these principles form the basis for the rules in more detailed Articles throughout the Regulation. For example: The transparency principle is the basis for the requirement to provide information under Articles 13 and 14 GDPR; The integrity and confidentiality principles are detailed by Article 32 GDPR on security; The accountability principle finds its roots in Articles 24 and 25 GDPR. The principles specified by Article 5 GDPR are the main 'bottleneck' for the legality of any processing operation - together with the requirement to have a legal basis under Article 6 GDPR . Any controller or processor must comply with all elements of Article 5 GDPR for each processing operation. In order to be ' lawful ', processing should comply with Article 6(1) GDPR , which requires that any processing operation must be based on at least one of the six legal bases in the exhaustive list provided. [ 1 ] However, Chapter II of the GDPR entails some provisions further clarifying the controller's obligations under Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6(1) GDPR; therefore, the controller has to comply with this provisions as well in order for the processing to be lawful. [ 2 ] In particular these provisions are Article 7 and 8 GDPR which have a direct effect on the validity of consent under Article 6(1)(a ) GDPR and Article 9 and 10 GDPR which provide for additional requirements for lawful processing. [ 3 ] Arguably, the same could be said about the requirements set out in Article 22(2) GDPR which provides for additional requirements for automated individual decision making. [ 4 ] \"It should be noted that the lawfulness of processing is precisely the subject, as is apparent from its actual title, of Article 6 of the GDPR, which provides that processing is to be lawful only if at least one of the conditions set out in points (a) to (f) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of that article is met [\u2026] That list of cases in which the processing of personal data may be regarded as lawful is exhaustive and restrictive, so that, in order that it can be regarded as lawful, processing must fall within one of the cases provided for in the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR [\u2026]. Furthermore, in so far as Articles 7 to 11 of the GDPR, which appear, like Articles 5 and 6 thereof, in Chapter II of that regulation, which chapter relates to principles, are intended to clarify the scope of the data controller\u2019s obligations under Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6(1) of that regulation, the processing of personal data, in order to be lawful, must also comply, as is apparent from the Court\u2019s case-law, with those other provisions of that chapter which concern, in essence, consent, processing of special categories of sensitive personal data and processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences [\u2026]\" CJEU - C-60/22 - Bundesrepublik Deutschland (Court electronic mailbox) , margin number 50 et seqq. The principle of lawful processing is linked to the general prohibition on processing personal data and is also enshrined in Article 8(2) of the EU Charter (' ...data ... must be processed ... on the basis of consent of the person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law. '). For further details on the various legal bases for processing personal data please see the commentary on Article 6(1) GDPR and Article 9(2) GDPR for special categories of personal data. For example: The newly appointed data protection officer asks their colleagues for the legal basis to record certain information in the system. They go through the six legal basis in Article 6(1) GDPR and realise that none of the provisions fit. The colleague argues that the controller always recorded this information and all other competitors do that too. The newly appointed data protection officer says: \" I am sorry, but 'everyone else does it' is not a legal basis \". There is an ongoing debate about a wider understanding of the term ' lawful '. The principle of lawfulness does not mean that processing which violates any administrative provision of the GDPR or any other law (environmental laws, tax law, employment laws), makes the processing not ' lawful ' within the meaning of the GDPR, as this would for example trigger the fine of  \u20ac20 million under Article 83(5) GDPR . E.g. a failure to conclude a joint controller ship agreement or to maintain a record of processing activities has no effect on the lawfulness of the processing activity, as highlighted by the CJEU: \"It follows, therefore, from the actual wording of Article 5(1)(a) and the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR that infringement by the controller of the obligations laid down in Articles 26 [i.e. conclusion of a joint controller ship agreement] and 30 [maintaining a record of processing activities] of that regulation does not constitute \u2018unlawful processing\u2019 within the meaning of Article 17(1)(d) and Article 18(1)(b) of that regulation, which would stem from the controller\u2019s infringement of the principle of \u2018accountability\u2019 as set out in Article 5(2) of that regulation.\" CJEU - C-60/22 - Bundesrepublik Deutschland (Court electronic mailbox) , margin number 50 et seqq. For example: A controller is processing the pictures of data subjects. The controller complies with all requirements under the GDPR, but did not seek the agreement from the photographer, who is the copy right holder. The processing of data subjects' pictures is unlawful under applicable copyright law, but not under the GDPR. However, there are also views that the violation of core principles of the GDPR that are directly protecting the data subject (like processing incorrect personal data) [ 5 ] would not constitute ' lawful ' processing. It seems that there may be some room to have a broader understanding of the term 'lawful' beyond Article 6(1) GDPR alone. Fairness, is an overall requirement of the GDPR and is also enshrined in Article 8(2) of the CFR. It is therefore important that the fairness principle is interpreted in the light of the Charter and the principle of proportionality in Article 52(1) CFR. Concepts like 'fairness' are\u00a0 inherently vague, but can serve as a 'catch-all' provision for situations that may not be in violation of the letter of the law, but are clearly not 'fair'. Similar 'catch-all' provisions can be found in other laws (e.g. the \"Unfair\" Terms Directive 93/13/EG) and are often the basis for existing case law. Indeed, it is a highly contextual question whether a certain processing operation can be considered as fair. EDPB Guidelines 4/2019 on Data Protection by Design and by Default provide a non-exhaustive list of certain elements of fairness which should always be respected while processing personal data. The list is particularly detailed and examples range from providing the data subject with a high level of autonomy in controlling the processing, to the right to fair algorithms and human intervention. Other important elements of fairness are officially recognised, such as the data subjects' expectation of reasonable use of their data, and the right not be discriminated or exploited as a consequence of certain psychological weaknesses. The imbalance of power between the controller and data subject often existing in certain intrusive profiling and processing operations seems connected to these principles. [ 6 ] The EDPB clarifies that, in order for the processing to be 'fair', no deception is allowed in data processing and that all options should be provided in an objective and neutral way, avoiding any deceptive or manipulative language or design. [ 7 ] For example: A controller only gets a 10% consent rate for the sharing of user data, as data subjects really do not want their personal data to be shared. The controller installs a task force to increase the consent rate. The controller decides to use 'dark patterns' to trick users into giving consent, as their lawyer found no provision in the GDPR that explicitly prohibits such behavior. After making the interface more and more deceptive, the controller gets a 90% consent rate, being fully aware that data subjects just give up when faced with deceptive and confusing consent mechanisms. The fairness principle could be used by the supervisory authority to end this practice. In general terms, the transparency principle requires that the data subject is fully aware of the processing of any personal data. Recital 39 GDPR contains a number of explanatory statements regarding the transparency principle. In particular, \" it should be transparent to natural persons that personal data concerning them are collected, used, consulted or otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will be processed\". Data subjects should be \" made aware of risks, rules, safeguards, and rights in relation to the processing... and how to exercise their rights\". All information communicated should be \" accessible and easy to understand \" and in \" clear and plain language \". The transparency principle is closely linked to more detailed provisions. For example: Article 12(1) GDPR ensures that information must be provided in a \" concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language \". Articles 13 and 14 GDPR provide for a right to receive information regarding the planned processing, even before processing takes place. Article 15 GDPR provides for a right to access information about the actual processing of the individual's data. The principle of purpose limitation ensures that personal data may only be processed for one or more specified purposes. Personal data that was collected for one purpose cannot freely be used for another purpose. The principle of purpose limitation is also enshrined in Article 8(2) CFR. It is therefore important that the principle of purpose limitation is interpreted in the light of the Charter and the principle of proportionality in Article 52(1) CFR. References to the concept of 'purpose limitation' can be found in other laws as well, in relation to information obligations to ensure professional secrecy and usually to limit the use of information to certain contexts. Equally, many financial regulations define purposes for which funds may or may not be used. For example: Lisa lives in a small town and visits the local doctor. Lisa tells him all the details about a rash in an intimate area. The next day a friend of Lisa asks her about her rash. It turns out that the doctor spread the information at the local bar last night. The doctor violated (among other things) the purpose limitation principle, as Lisa only shared this information for treatment purposes, not for the entertainment of the local crowd. While the controller is free to define any legitimate purpose, Article 5(1)(b) sets out the principle of purpose limitation in the processing of personal data. It requires that personal data be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and ensures that, after collection, data are not used for purposes that are incompatible with the specified original purpose(s). The purpose has to be specified in the moment the personal data is first 'collected' by the controller. [ 8 ] Collection (see Article 4(2) GDPR ) is to be understood as the first step in any processing operation. The purpose limitation principle extends to the 'further processing' by all recipients to whom the personal data have been disclosed. [ 9 ] The purpose is meant to limit processing operations to a specific, pre-defined, aim. Any overly broad purpose would defeat the aim of purpose limitation. A controller can however name multiple purposes. Purposes that are too broad would undermine the protections that the purpose limitation principle tries to establish. Broad descriptions like 'improving the user experience', 'marketing', 'research' or 'IT security' are not sufficiently defined. [ 10 ] For example, in its Guidelines 3/2019 on video surveillance , the EDPB clarified that monitoring purposes need to be specified for every surveillance camera in use and \"[v] ideo surveillance based on the mere purpose of 'safety' or 'for your safety' is not sufficiently specific \". [ 11 ] Similarly, in the context of the creation of user-accounts on e-commerce websites, the EDPB considered that \"creating an account for the user to access online sales or service offersor to make a purchase\" does not constitute a specific purpose. [ 12 ] While a purpose may not be too broad, there is no limitation as to how specific a purpose may be. The exact level of specificity is not objectively defined in the GDPR. In many cases it is possible to split broad purposes into multiple, more specific purposes. For example: A controller tells data subjects that their data will be used for \" business purposes \". To simulate a bit more specificity, the lawyers added a non-exhaustive list of more specific purposes. The clause now reads \" business purposes, such as billing, fraud prevention and product improvement \". Under this clause the controller can use data for basically any purpose, it is not specific enough. The purpose may not only be defined internally, but must be explicitly stated. Article 5(1)(b) does not foresee a certain form of documentation, but Articles 5(2) or 30(1)(a) GDPR require documentation and Articles 6(1)(a) , 13(1)(c) and 14(1)(c) GDPR require the disclosure of the specific purpose(s) to the data subject. The use of personal data for the stated purpose must be legal. This qualification includes laws beyond the GDPR and national data protection laws (like consumer or worker protection laws). For example: An employer surveils its employees for 'efficiency reasons'. The local employment law prohibits video surveillance at the workplace without the agreement of the workers' council. The purpose is not legitimate. Many other provisions of the GDPR refer to the defined 'purpose', making the defined purpose the 'backbone' of many steps of the legal analysis under the GDPR. Once the purpose changes, many other elements of the GDPR may lead to different results. For example: Article 4(7) defines the controller as the natural and legal person which, alone or jointly with others, determines the 'purpose' of the processing. Article 5(1)(b) GDPR itself stipulates that personal data shall be collected only for specified, explicit and legitimate 'purposes'. Article 5(1)(d) determines the time data may be kept by referring to the purpose, Article 6(1)(a) GDPR allows consent for one or more 'specific purposes'. This makes the proper definition of purposes a crucial step for compliance with the GDPR. For example: Peter asks customers to participate in a raffle. They can enter their email on his website. The drawing is on the 10th anniversary of his business. The purpose ('participation in a raffle') does not only have to be specified for the consent to be valid, but also determines that Peter may not process the data for any other purpose and determines that the personal data must be deleted after the 10th anniversary raffle is over. If Peter would have added another purpose (e.g. signing up to his newsletter) another consent clause may need to be added and the deletion period may be extended until such time that a customer unsubscribes from the newsletter. The principle of purpose limitation shall ensure that controllers do not engage in 'secondary use' ('further processing') of personal data when such processing is incompatible with the original purpose(s). For example: A doctor may not suddenly use their patient's health data for marketing purposes, as this would be a 'secondary use' that goes beyond the original purpose. However, a doctor may use his records in a court procedure to prove that a patient has not paid medical bills. The uses of the word 'incompatible' in Article 6(1)(b) of previous Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC has however raised questions if there would also be 'compatible' purposes. Article 8(2) of the EU Charter does not use the word 'incompatible', hence any departure from the principle of purpose limitation must be seen as a limitation of EU Charter rights under Article 52(1) of the EU Charter and must therefore be provided by law and are subject to a proportionality test. The GDPR introduced the following exceptions to the principle of purpose limitation in Articles 5(1)(c) and 6(4) GDPR: further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes under Article 89(1) GDPR ; further processing allowed or required by Union or Member State law under Article 6(4) GDPR ; further processing based on the data subject's consent under Article 6(4) GDPR and further processing for a compatible purpose under Article 6(4) GDPR . See the commentary on Article 6(4) GDPR for details on the compatibility assessment. The principle of data minimisation gives expression to the principle of proportionality, meaning that interference with the fundamental right to data protection must be proportionate (Article 8 in connection with Article 52 EU Charter). [ 13 ] The principle of proportionality, requires that any processing of personal data is 'necessary'. Unlike the previous Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC, under which data processing did not have to be 'excessive', the GDPR specifies that it must be 'limited to what is necessary' to achieve the purpose. This principle of data minimisation is therefore closely related to the principle of purpose limitation and only leads to accurate results if the specific purpose is well defined by the controller. A controller must review each step of a processing operation and also each data element towards the necessity to achieve the purpose. Therefore, the controller has to ensure that only personal data which are strictly necessary regarding the purpose of the processing are collected. Date collection in a generalised and indiscriminate manner is therefore incompatible with the principle of data minimisation. [ 14 ] For example: An online shop requires all customers to fill out their exact birth date, to confirm that they are 18 or older. Given that the online shop cannot verify the birth dates, a simple 'yes/no' question would fulfil the same purpose, without collecting exact birth dates. Therefore, a controller may not engage in the collection of personal data in a generalised and indiscriminate manner. To the contrary, it has to collecting only data which are strictly necessary with regard to the pursued purpose of the processing. [ 15 ] The principle of data minimisation is also an overlap with the principle of storage limitation stipulated it Article 5(1)(e) GDPR since data minimisation also has a temporal element requiring the controller to limit the period of collection of personal data to what is strictly necessary for the pursued purpose. [ 16 ] \"In any event, the storage of the personal data of the users of a social network platform for an unlimited period for the purpose of targeted advertising must be considered to be a disproportionate interference in the rights guaranteed to those users by the GDPR. [...] In any event, the indiscriminate use of all of the personal data held by a social network platform for advertising purposes, irrespective of the level of sensitivity of the data, does not appear to be a proportionate interference with the rights guaranteed by the GDPR to users of that platform.\" CJEU - C-446/21 - Schrems v Facebook Ireland (2021) , margin number 58 and 64. The three elements in Article 5(1)(c) GDPR are somewhat redundant and overlapping: Personal data is 'adequate' if it is appropriate to use such data for the purpose (for example, the address of a person is not an appropriate information for credit ranking). [ 17 ] Personal data is 'relevant' if it leads to a different outcome in relation to the purpose (for example, the address of a customer is relevant to deliver a product). [ 18 ] Personal data is 'limited to what is necessary' when the purpose cannot reasonably be achieved without the processing of that personal data. [ 19 ] Regarding the necessity of a processing activity, see the respective commentary on Article 6 GDPR . In C-708/18 - TK v Asocia\u0163ia de Proprietari bloc M5A-ScaraA the CJEU had to provide guidance on how to assess whether processing (in that case, a video surveillance system) could be considered \" necessary \" for the purpose of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller. The Court held that the necessity of a processing operation must be examined in conjunction with the data minimisation principle which restricts the controller's options to those \" adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are collected \". [ 20 ] \"[T]he proportionality of the data processing by a video surveillance device must be assessed by taking into account the specific methods of installing and operating that device, which must limit the effect thereof on the rights and freedoms of data subjects while ensuring the effectiveness of the video surveillance system at issue. Consequently, [\u2026] the condition relating to the need for processing implies that the controller must examine, for example, whether it is sufficient that the video surveillance operates only at night or outside normal working hours, and block or obscure the images taken in areas where surveillance is unnecessary.\" CJEU - C\u2011708/18 - Asocia\u0163ia de Proprietari bloc M5A-ScaraA , margin number 50 et seq. In C-394/23 - Mousse , the CJEU considered the processing of personal data relating to the title of the customers of a transport undertaking, in order to personalise commercial communication based on those customers\u2019 gender identity, not necessary for the performance of a contract. [ 21 ] In the same decision, the CJEU articulated serious doubts that such processing could be considered necessary for the legitimate interest of personalising commercial communication with customers. [ 22 ] The principle of data minimisation does however not mean that any processing of large data quantities is always illegal. If the use of larger quantities of personal data is the only way to achieve a purpose, a controller may use any 'necessary' data. [ 23 ] Article 5(1)(d) requires that personal data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date, and that all reasonable steps be taken to delete or rectify inaccurate data promptly. This retirement aims to prevent harm to data subjects, as inaccurate information can have major effects on them. Accuracy of data expresses a more general principle of the correct representation of the person on all levels and all contexts, and is one of the essential prerequisites of the right to informational self-determination. [ 24 ] The principle of accuracy is especially challenging when a controller uses systems that are a 'black box' even to the controller, like 'artificial intelligence', 'self-learning' or 'big data' analytics. [ 25 ] The GDPR does however not privilege such approaches. To the contrary, Article 5(1)(d) is meant to protect from computers making arbitrary and inaccurate decisions. Controllers are liable for the accuracy of the personal data they process, no matter which technology they use. Not any information that relates to a person can be objectively 'correct' or 'incorrect'. Certain information about a person (e.g. how likable or attractive a person is) may be subjective by nature and is therefore hard to 'correct'. \"[T]he assessment of whether personal data is accurate and complete must be made in the light of the purpose for which those data were collected [...].\" CJEU - C-247/23 - Deldits , margin number 26 with further references. There are various types of information that is discussed in this respect: Clearly, objective facts about a person (like a name, birth date or street address) can be 'inaccurate' and are therefore subject to Article 5(1)(d) GDPR. The principle of accuracy applies not only to hard facts that are processed about a person, but also to forecasts and correlations. [ 26 ] This is particularly relevant for modern forms of automated profiling, artificial intelligence powered processing and machine-learning systems. Indeed, predictions can also be objectively inaccurate if they are based on an erroneous factual basis, assume wrong premises or are the result of incorrect conclusions or methodology. [ 27 ] Controllers and processors cannot bypass Article 5(1)(d) by claiming that a forecast or prediction of an objective nature is merely a value judgment. For example: A credit ranking algorithm predicts a high likeliness that Claudia will go bankrupt within the next month. Various contract partners now cancel her cell phone contract, credit card and car lease. Objectively this is wholly inaccurate, Claudia is very affluent, has a good job and hardly spends money. The result is based on an algorithm that is mainly considering her age and the street address of Claudia. Being mindful of money, she chose a cheaper 'upcoming' neighborhood - allowing her to save even more of her income every month. The questionable methodology of the prediction likely leads to structurally inaccurate personal data on Claudia. While evidence based predictions and forecasts can objectively be wrong, pure value judgments cannot be 'inaccurate', as they are not objectively correct by their very nature. For example: Jacob is participating in a beauty contest. He only gets an average of 5.5 by the judges. He is very surprised by this result. Given that there is no objective number on beauty, Jacob cannot exercise his 'right to rectification' to achieve a 10.0 score. However, if Jacob finds out that the computer system made an error when calculating his average, the result is objectively wrong and Jacob may request a rectification. Outdated personal data is a subset of inaccurate personal data, as the data became inaccurate over time.  The consequences for data subjects can be very similar. While personal data must always be accurate, Article 5(1)(d) limits the need to update (previously correct) personal data to situations where this is necessary. Controllers must be able to update information like email addresses, names or even birth dates and actively update information when necessary. For example: In country A, all hospital records must be archived by national law. The hospital also keeps the contract details of patients in a central customer database. Peter weighed 135kg when he was in hospital in 2016, but is now down to 85kg. It is neither 'necessary' to update the old files, nor would this be 'accurate', given that the records are meant to show the status of Peter at the time where he was at the hospital in 2016. At the same time, as Peter has moved to a new address, he may want to update his contact details when he is back to the hospital for his yearly checkup. The controller has a duty to actively keep records accurate. If a controller does not comply with this obligation, data subjects can exercise various rights: Article 16 GDPR allows them to rectify incorrect data and to supplement missing information. Article 19 GDPR requires that the rectification is also communicated (with similar consequences) to all those who have received the data previously. Article 82 GDPR allows them to receive compensation, when inaccurate data leads to any damage. The principle of storage limitation imposes a time limit on any processing operation, which forms a type of 'data minimisation' in a temporal dimension. It follows form Article 8 in connection with Article 52 of the EU Charter, that once all purposes of a processing operation are fulfilled, the operation must stop for it to still be 'proportionate'. The storage limitation principle not only sets a time limit on processing, it requires that the controller should define a storage period internally before the processing begins. [ 28 ] That storage period does not necessarily have to be a specific period of time, but even where a controller is not able to predict precisely how long processing will be necessary in advance, it must regularly review whether processing continues to be necessary. See recital 39 GDPR, \"In order to ensure that the personal data are not kept longer than necessary, time limits should be established by the controller for erasure or for a periodic review\". The controller must inform the data subject about the storage period upfront (see Articles 13(2)(a) and 14(2)(a) GDPR) as well as ensure and demonstrate compliance with this principle. This strengthens the requirement for a storage period to be set in advance, because whether or not a controller has set a period and whether that period is adequate should be visible to a data subject. Article 13 GDPR requires a specific period of time or specific date unless \"it is not possible to do so\", in which case the criterion for deciding how long data should be kept must be explained. For example: Jacque is a physiotherapist. Under applicable law Jacque must store all information relevant for tax purposes for seven years. Laws on health professionals require him to keep a patient documentation for two years. In case of non-payment the statute of limitations is three years. Once these timelines have run out, Jacque deletes any personal data. His patient documentation software deletes information automatically after a set period. He does his finances in a large spreadsheet. Here he must manually delete the information. Jacque also likes numbers and statistics, so he still keeps any his income statistics or statistics about guarantee cases for the past twenty years, but removed the personal data contained therein to comply with Article 5(1)(e) GDPR. It is not enough for a controller to keep to the storage period they have decided in advance or to that which they have informed the data subject, the controller must be able to demonstrate that personal data are kept only for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or for which they have been further processed. [ 29 ] To comply with Article 5(1)(e), personal data can be deleted or anonymised by controllers. The latter means that any link between the data and the relevant person must be removed. Controllers have complied with Article 5(1)(e) once the data does not relate to an identifiable person. The GDPR imposes an active duty on the controller [ 30 ] to delete data. The controller may not wait for an action by the data subject (e.g. under Article 17 GDPR ) but must proactively delete information. In practice, the principle requires that the controller implements deletion practices or automatic deletion systems. The time by which any deletion has to be executed depends on the purpose. In many cases there are fixed legal deadlines, like record keeping duties or the statute of limitations that determine the need to retain data. In other cases, the deadline depends on other factual elements (e.g. when a customer cancels a contract) that make continuous processing irrelevant for the purpose. There are also cases where there is no clear number of days to keep information. As there is no general deadline, the controller has to engage in a factual case-by-case analysis. \"It follows [\u2026] that even initially lawful processing of data may over time become incompatible with the GDPR where those data are no longer necessary in the light of the purposes for which they were collected or further processed and those data must be deleted once those purposes have been achieved [...]\" CJEU - C-446/21 - Schrems v Facebook Ireland (2021) , margin number 56.. An exception to the principle of storage limitation is contained in the last part of Article 5(1)(e) in favour of processing for archiving, statistical, scientific, and historical research purposes in the public interest. In these cases, the GDPR allows 'longer periods' of storage, and in so doing takes into account the public interest in research and the preservation of the collective memory. However, in order for the exception to apply,\u00a0technical and organisational measures must be put in place, as set out in Article 89(1) GDPR . The GDPR requires technical and organisational measures to ensure that the security of personal data is maintained, including measures to ensure that data is neither processed in an unauthorised or unlawful way, nor lost, damaged or destroyed. The principle is further specified in Article 32 GDPR on the security of processing. For example: A financial institution must make sure that financial information is neither hacked nor leaked by its own employees. Equally, it must ensure that accounts are neither altered nor deleted. In some cases, the institution can achieve this through technical measures (e.g. security systems, limiting access to certain persons). However, not every risk can be addressed by technical solutions (e.g. some persons must have full access to information, hardware or software to run the system). In these cases organizational measures (e.g. non-disclosure agreements, access limitations to server rooms) can be more appropriate. A data subject may not only be harmed by the unlawful processing of their personal data but also as a result of the loss of this data. For example, if a hospital loses the personal data of a patient, they may get an incorrect treatment. The controller must ensure that personal data is not falsely deleted or altered. Threats to the integrity of personal data may come from within the controller, third parties or from an accident. Confidentiality aims to protect data against unauthorised access and against unauthorised processing. The controller must therefore also implement technical and organisational measures to ensure that personal data is not falsely disclosed, hacked or lost. This includes that unauthorised persons neither have access to the data nor to the devices on which they are processed (Recital 39). For more details on the 'security of processing' see the commentary on Article 32 GDPR . The accountability principle was added in the GDPR to further highlight and clarify the responsibility of the controller. The first element of Article 5(2) GDPR clarifies that compliance with the principles under Article 5(1) is the responsibility of the controller. It is largely redundant, as the GDPR otherwise makes clear the that controller is responsible for compliance with many elements of the GDPR. In particular, Article 24 GDPR broadens the accountability principle stipulated in Article 5(2) by obliging the controller to ensure (and to be able to demonstrate) that the whole processing is performed in accordance with the GDPR (see commentary on Article 24 GDPR). Articles 28 and 29 GDPR also deal with the responsibilities and relationships of controllers and processors. Article 5(2) GDPR is often overruled by more specific provisions, as many of the provisions that implement the principles in Article 5(1) GDPR actually apply to 'controllers and processors'. For example Article 32 GDPR requires that \" controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures \", even if according to Article 5(2) the controller is responsible for compliance with the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f). From a practical perspective controllers may not always be the entities that have the factual, economic or practical power over processing operations. Even large cooperation or government entities have a hard time to get GDPR compliant products or software from major vendors, who are often a global monopoly or duopoly. While some services (like 'SaaS' or 'Cloud' services) may fall under the definition of a 'processor', mere software or hardware vendors are not directly covered by the GDPR. The GDPR foresees that controllers would use their economic and contractual options to ensure that these entities provide GDPR compliant products. For example: Lara is running a small online shop on a server she rents. Most of Lara's customers pay with a popular payment provider that is only available in her country. There is only one online shop system that integrates well with this local payment provider. While her contract with the software provider guarantee that the software is 'GDPR compliant' she finds out that the online shop software unlawfully sends personal data of customers to the manufacturer. Under the GDPR only Lara is responsible for her online shop software being fully compliant. She can only pursue contractual claims against the software provider, as she was in fact served with a non-compliant software. In addition to being responsible, the controller also has to be able to demonstrate compliance with the law. However, this provision does not further specify how a controller is required to demonstrate compliance, as this is highly dependent on the processing operation and the type of organisation carrying it out. Compliance can be demonstrated by implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with Article 24 , 25 and 32 GDPR (see commentary on Article 24 GDPR for specific examples).  In most cases, written documentation will be used to demonstrate compliance. If applicable, a record of processing activities (see Article 30 GDPR ) is a form to demonstrate compliance. Article 5(2) GDPR does not limit the duty to demonstrate compliance to cases before a supervisory authority. The provision, for example, also applies to complaint procedures under Article 77 GDPR or civil litigation under Article 79 GDPR . If a controller cannot provide relevant documentation, this in itself can lead to fines (see Article 83(5)(a) GDPR ). This ensures that simply avoiding evidence of non-compliance is not a reasonable path for a controller. It is subject to procedural law how an inability to demonstrate compliance is treated in procedures under Articles 77 or 78 GDPR. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 5 GDPR \u2191 Herbst , in K\u00fchling, Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 5 GDPR, margin number 8 (C.H.

Decisions 5 References 1. The lead supervisory authority shall cooperate with the other supervisory authorities concerned in accordance with this Article in an endeavour to reach consensus. The lead supervisory authority and the supervisory authorities concerned shall exchange all relevant information with each other. 2. The lead supervisory authority may request at any time other supervisory authorities concerned to provide mutual assistance pursuant to Article 61 and may conduct joint operations pursuant to Article 62, in particular for carrying out investigations or for monitoring the implementation of a measure concerning a controller or processor established in another Member State. 3. The lead supervisory authority shall, without delay, communicate the relevant information on the matter to the other supervisory authorities concerned. It shall without delay submit a draft decision to the other supervisory authorities concerned for their opinion and take due account of their views. 4. Where any of the other supervisory authorities concerned within a period of four weeks after having been consulted in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article, expresses a relevant and reasoned objection to the draft decision, the lead supervisory authority shall, if it does not follow the relevant and reasoned objection or is of the opinion that the objection is not relevant or reasoned, submit the matter to the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63. 5. Where the lead supervisory authority intends to follow the relevant and reasoned objection made, it shall submit to the other supervisory authorities concerned a revised draft decision for their opinion. That revised draft decision shall be subject to the procedure referred to in paragraph 4 within a period of two weeks. 6. Where none of the other supervisory authorities concerned has objected to the draft decision submitted by the lead supervisory authority within the period referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5, the lead supervisory authority and the supervisory authorities concerned shall be deemed to be in agreement with that draft decision and shall be bound by it. 7. The lead supervisory authority shall adopt and notify the decision to the main establishment or single establishment of the controller or processor, as the case may be and inform the other supervisory authorities concerned and the Board of the decision in question, including a summary of the relevant facts and grounds. The supervisory authority with which a complaint has been lodged shall inform the complainant on the decision. 8. By derogation from paragraph 7, where a complaint is dismissed or rejected, the supervisory authority with which the complaint was lodged shall adopt the decision and notify it to the complainant and shall inform the controller thereof. 9. Where the lead supervisory authority and the supervisory authorities concerned agree to dismiss or reject parts of a complaint and to act on other parts of that complaint, a separate decision shall be adopted for each of those parts of the matter. The lead supervisory authority shall adopt the decision for the part concerning actions in relation to the controller, shall notify it to the main establishment or single establishment of the controller or processor on the territory of its Member State and shall inform the complainant thereof, while the supervisory authority of the complainant shall adopt the decision for the part concerning dismissal or rejection of that complaint, and shall notify it to that complainant and shall inform the controller or processor thereof. 10. After being notified of the decision of the lead supervisory authority pursuant to paragraphs 7 and 9, the controller or processor shall take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with the decision as regards processing activities in the context of all its establishments in the Union. The controller or processor shall notify the measures taken for complying with the decision to the lead supervisory authority, which shall inform the other supervisory authorities concerned. 11. Where, in exceptional circumstances, a supervisory authority concerned has reasons to consider that there is an urgent need to act in order to protect the interests of data subjects, the urgency procedure referred to in Article 66 shall apply. 12. The lead supervisory authority and the other supervisory authorities concerned shall supply the information required under this Article to each other by electronic means, using a standardised format. Article 60 GDPR introduces Chapter VII of the GDPR under the heading \u201c Cooperation and consistency \u201d and, in particular, Section 1 of that Chapter, headed \u201c Cooperation \u201d. Article 60 GDPR provides for uniform supervision of controllers and processors in the event of cross-border processing and that cross-border enforcement decisions are agreed upon jointly by all the supervisory authorities concerned ( \"CSAs\" ), while they are formally adopted by a single supervisory authority (\"SA\") that cooperates with the SAs of the other Member States concerned and takes due account of their views. [ 1 ] Article 60 GDPR regulates the co-decision making procedure to be followed in cross-border cases ( Article 56(1) GDPR ). It specifies the rules of procedure that follows after the lead supervisory authority ( \"LSA\" ) has been identified under the competence-establishing provision of Article 56(1) GDPR . In such cases, the LSA, i.e. the SA of the place where the controller's or processor's main or sole establishment is located in the EEA, assumes the role of directing and coordinating the decision-making procedure. In doing so, the LSA has to cooperate with the other CSA in accordance with the principles and rules provided by Article 60 GDPR and more generally throughout Chapter VII. The cooperation procedure, in the event of a complaint-based investigation, ends with the decision of a SA which either (i) finds a violation of the GDPR by the controller or processor and orders the infringment to be remedied and thereby at the same time grants or partialy grants the complaint or (ii) rejects or dismisses the complaint or parts thereof. [ 2 ] In addition to relevant provisions of the GDPR, national procedural rules apply for any matter that is not regulated by the GDPR. Case law: C-645/19 , paras 51-53 A draft procedural regulation has been proposed by the Commission to further specify the rules on cooperation between SAs in the one-stop-shop mechanism with the aim to address the shortcomings of the current regulation. EDPB Guidelines : on this Article, please see Guidelines 02/2022 on the application of Article 60 GDPR The ultimate aim of the cooperation procedure under Article 60 GDPR is to adopt a uniform decision for data processing operations of a cross-border nature. The task of directing or, rather, coordinating the decision-making procedure falls to the LSA. In practice, this translates into three essential (though not exclusive) obligations. As soon as the LSA learns of its responsibility under Article 56(1) GDPR , it must take the initiative and identify the other CSA . [ 3 ] In doing so, it is necessary to verify the main elements of the processing and to understand which Member States are likely to be affected by it. In this perspective, it is necessary to verify, for example, in which Member States the data subjects whose rights may be violated are located and/or the locations of the controller's or processor's establishments. After composing the \u201c decision-making group \u201d, the LSA is obliged to \u201c cooperate \u201d with all other CSA and to facilitate the sharing of information necessary for the decision-making process (\u201c exchange all relevant information with each other \u201d). [ 4 ] Article 60 GDPR puts a particular focus on the information exchange obligation. Effective Union-wide enforcement requires that all CSAs, including the LSA, receive and share all relevant information on cross-border data processing as promptly as possible. The duty of exchange of information exists even when the identity of the LSA is still unclear as the required exchange of information must take place in any case under Article 61 GDPR and Article 62 GDPR . The LSA should act in a consensus-building manner. It must endeavor to reach a \u201c consensus \u201d with the other CSA. [ 5 ] CSAs must therefore be given adequate information and sufficient opportunity to present their legal positions (Article 60(3) GDPR), which, as long as possible, is to be incorporated into the LSA\u2019s final assessment. [ 6 ] The LSA must not limit itself to taking into account the views of the other CSA only within the framework of a draft decision (Article 60(3) GDPR), but should work towards a consensual approach with the other CSA from the start of the procedure. [ 7 ] The above is confirmed by Recital 125 GDPR, which specifies that \u201c the supervisory authority should closely involve and coordinate the supervisory authorities concerned in the decision-making process \u201d. However, Article 60(1) GDPR is not obliging the LSA to reach a consensus with the other CSAs. [ 8 ] If a consensus cannot be reached, the dispute resolution mechanism under Article 65 GDPR in connection with Article 63 GDPR is triggered (Article 60 (4) GDPR). Article 60(2) GDPR clarifies that also in cross-border cases the LSA and CSAs have to cooperate pursuant to Article 61 GDPR and Article 62 GDPR . Before issuing a binding decision, it might (and usually will) be necessary for the LSA and the CSAs to exercise investigative powers in their territory to establish the facts of the case. To that end, the LSA can request other CSAs to provide mutual assistance pursuant to Article 61 GDPR and conduct joint operations pursuant to Article 62 GDPR . Once the decision has been adopted, it must be ensured that it is actually complied with. Therefore, cooperation can also be requested after the decision has been adopted for \u201c monitoring the implementation of a measure concerning a controller or processor established in another Member State \u201d. [ 9 ] Article 60(3) GDPR sets out the procedural background of the cooperation mechanism. [ 10 ] The LSA communicates the relevant information on the matter to the other CSAs and, without delay, provides them with a draft decision for their opinion, which have to be taken into \u201c due account \u201d. It follows that the LSA must adequately address the positions of the other SAs and integrate them into the decision-making process. The LSA has no clear timeline or set deadlines that it would have to follow. In praxis this means that it is no execption if cross-border procedures take several years. Under Article 60(4) GDPR any CSA can object to the draft decision drawn up and provided by the LSA pursuant to Article 60(3) GDPR, if they do not agree with it. The objection has to be relevant and reasoned to be considered. CSAs have 4 weeks to exemine the draft decision and epress their reasoned objections, if any. If the LSA does not follow the relevant and reasoned objection(s) from a CSA or believes that the objection(s) is not reasoned or relevant, the matter is referred to the attention of the European Data Protection Board ( \"EDPB\" ) which will decide it following Article 63 GDPR and Article 65(1)(a) GDPR . It then becomes incumbent upon the EDPB to adopt a binding decision on whether the objection is \u201c relevant and reasoned \u201d and, in general, if it meets the requirements outlined in Article 4(24) GDPR . What constitutes a relevant and reasoned objection is defined in Article 4(24) GDPR stipulating that it is an objection to a draft decision as to \u201c whether there is an infringement of this Regulation, or whether envisaged action in relation to the controller or processor complies with this Regulation, which clearly demonstrates the significance of the risks posed by the draft decision as regards the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects and, where applicable, the free flow of personal data within the Union \u201d. [ 11 ] An objection submitted by a CSA should indicate each part of the draft decision that is considered deficient, erroneous or lacking some necessary elements, either by referring to specific articles/paragraphs or by other clear indication and showing why such issues are to be deemed \u201c relevant \u201d as further explained below. Therefore, the objection aims, first of all, at pointing out how and why according to the CSA the draft decision does not appropriately address the situation and/or does not envision appropriate action towards the controller or processor. The proposals for amendments put forward by the objection should aim to remedy these errors. For the objection to be considered as \u201c relevant \u201d, there must be a direct connection between the objection and the draft decision at issue. More specifically, the objection needs to concern either whether there is an infringement of the GDPR or whether the envisaged action in relation to the controller or processor complies with the GDPR. An objection should only be considered relevant if it relates to the specific legal and factual content of the draft decision. Raising only abstract or broad comments or objections cannot be considered relevant in this context. [ 12 ] In order for the objection to be \u201c reasoned \u201d, it needs to include clarifications and arguments as to why an amendment of the decision is proposed (i.e. the alleged legal/factual mistakes of the draft decision). It also needs to demonstrate how the change would lead to a different conclusion as to whether there is an infringement of the GDPR or whether the envisaged action in relation to the controller or processor complies with the GDPR. The CSA should provide sound reasoning for its objection, particularly by reference to legal arguments (relying on EU law and/or relevant national law and including e.g. legal provisions, guidelines, case law) or factual arguments, where applicable. The CSA should present the fact(s) allegedly leading to a different conclusion regarding the infringement of the GDPR by the controller/processor or the aspect of the decision that, in their view, is deficient/erroneous. In order for an objection to be adequately reasoned, it should be coherent, clear, precise and detailed in explaining the reasons for objection. It should set forth, clearly and precisely, the essential facts on which the CSA based its assessment and the link between the envisaged consequences of the draft decision (if it was to be issued \u201cas is\u201d) and the significance of the anticipated risks. Moreover, the CSA should indicate which parts of the draft decision it disagrees with. In cases where the objection is based on the opinion that the LSA failed to investigate an essential fact of the case entirely, or on an additional violation of the GDPR, it would be sufficient for the CSA to present such arguments in a conclusive and substantiated manner. [ 13 ] The CSA\u2019s objections to the draft decision must be justified and motivated through reference to evidence and facts that support the objection, by having regard to the facts and evidence [ 14 ] provided by the LSA. These requirements should apply to each specific infringement and to each specific provision in question (e.g.if the draft decision says that the controller infringed Articles 6, 7, 14 GDPR , and the CSA disagrees on whether there is an infringement of Article 7, 14 GDPR and considers that there is an infringement of Article 13 GDPR ). In some circumstances, the objection could go as far as identifying gaps in the draft decision justifying the need for further investigation by the LSA. For instance, if the investigation carried out by the LSA unjustifiably fails to cover some of the issues raised by the complainant or resulting from an infringement reported by a CSA, a relevant and reasoned objection may be raised based on the failure of the LSA to handle the complaint properly and in safeguarding the rights of the data subject. [ 15 ] EDPB Guidelines: On this provision there are the Guidelines 09/2020 on relevant and reasoned objection under Regulation 2016/679 Where the LSA intends to follow one or more relevant and reasoned objections made by one or more CSAs, it shall submit to the other supervisory authorities concerned a revised draft decision for their opinion as foreseen in Article 60(4) GDPR. However, in this case, the CSAs only have two weeks to express their opinion. Where none of the other CSAs has objected to the draft decision submitted by the LSA within the period referred to in Article 60(4) and (5) GDPR, the LSA and the CSAs shall be deemed to agree with that draft decision and shall be bound by it. In this case, the decision becomes final. The LSA shall adopt and notify the decision to the main establishment or single establishment of the controller or processor, as the case may be, and inform the other CSAs and the EDPB about the decision, including a summary of the relevant facts and grounds. The SA with which a complaint has been lodged shall inform the complainant on the decision. By derogation from Article 60(7) GDPR, where a complaint is dismissed or rejected, the SA with which the complaint was lodged shall adopt the decision and notify it to the complainant and shall inform the controller thereof. This provision facilitates the data subject who might intend to file an appeal before a national court. Where the LSA and the CSAs agree to dismiss or reject parts of a complaint and to act on other parts of that complaint, a separate decision shall be adopted for each of those parts of the matter. On the one hand, the LSA adopts the decision for the part concerning actions about the controller, notifies it to the main establishment or single establishment of the controller or processor on the territory of its Member State and informs the complainant. On the other hand, the SA of the complainant adopts the decision for the part concerning dismissal or rejection, notifies it to the complainant and informs the controller or processor. After being notified of the decision of the LSA according to Article 60(7) and (9) GDPR, the controller or processor shall take the necessary measures to ensure compliance for all its establishments in the Union. The controller or processor shall notify the measures taken for complying with the decision to the LSA, which shall inform the other CSAs. Where, in exceptional circumstances, a CSA has reasons to consider that there is an urgent need to act in order to protect the interests of data subjects, the urgency procedure referred to in Article 66 GDPR shall apply. The LSA and the other CSAs shall supply the information required under Article 60 GDPR to each other by electronic means, using a standardised format. Since May 2018, \u201c the Board and DPAs have been using the IMI case registry, in which cases with a cross-border component are normally logged in.45 In due course the European Commission is empowered to draw up a standardised format (see Article 61(9)).46 The existence of a standardised format may partially alleviate the administrative burdens and costs linked with the exchange of documents (e.g. translations), which may nonetheless remain substantial \u201d.

(9) Implementing acts by the Commission 4 Decisions 5 References 1.   Supervisory authorities shall provide each other with relevant information and mutual assistance in order to implement and apply this Regulation in a consistent manner, and shall put in place measures for effective cooperation with one another. Mutual assistance shall cover, in particular, information requests and supervisory measures, such as requests to carry out prior authorisations and consultations, inspections and investigations. 2.   Each supervisory authority shall take all appropriate measures required to reply to a request of another supervisory authority without undue delay and no later than one month after receiving the request. Such measures may include, in particular, the transmission of relevant information on the conduct of an investigation. 3.   Requests for assistance shall contain all the necessary information, including the purpose of and reasons for the request. Information exchanged shall be used only for the purpose for which it was requested. 4.   The requested supervisory authority shall not refuse to comply with the request unless: 5.   The requested supervisory authority shall inform the requesting supervisory authority of the results or, as the case may be, of the progress of the measures taken in order to respond to the request. The requested supervisory authority shall provide reasons for any refusal to comply with a request pursuant to paragraph 4. 6.   Requested supervisory authorities shall, as a rule, supply the information requested by other supervisory authorities by electronic means, using a standardised format. 7.   Requested supervisory authorities shall not charge a fee for any action taken by them pursuant to a request for mutual assistance. Supervisory authorities may agree on rules to indemnify each other for specific expenditure arising from the provision of mutual assistance in exceptional circumstances. 8.   Where a supervisory authority does not provide the information referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article within one month of receiving the request of another supervisory authority, the requesting supervisory authority may adopt a provisional measure on the territory of its Member State in accordance with Article 55(1). In that case, the urgent need to act under Article 66(1) shall be presumed to be met and require an urgent binding decision from the Board pursuant to Article 66(2). 9.   The Commission may, by means of implementing acts, specify the format and procedures for mutual assistance referred to in this Article and the arrangements for the exchange of information by electronic means between supervisory authorities, and between supervisory authorities and the Board, in particular the standardised format referred to in paragraph 6 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2). Article 61(1) GDPR regulates how independent authorities are to cooperate to enable the uniform application of the GDPR. Supervisory authorities (\u201c SA \u201d) must share any relevant information and, where requested, provide mutual assistance in relation to the carrying out of certain investigations or acts of investigation. Article 61(2) GDPR requires SAs to have appropriate organisational and technical measures in place to respond promptly to mutual assistance requests made in accordance with certain standards of clarity (Article 61(3) GDPR). Requests are imperative and, subject to specific exceptions (Article 61(4) and (5) GDPR), must be fulfilled and, as a rule, acknowledged electronically (Article 61(7) GDPR) and free of charge (Article 61(7) GDPR). Finally, where the requested activity is not carried out, the national SA is given the possibility of adopting measures that have legal effects on the territory of its Member State (Article 61(8) GDPR). The ultimate goal of the mutual assistance under Article 61 GDPR is to \" implement and apply [the] Regulation in a consistent manner \". SAs \" provide each other with relevant information \" and \" mutual assistance \". By using the conjunction \" and \", the lawmaker seems to suggest that \" information \" and \" mutual assistance \" are alternative. Such conclusion should be rejected because \" relevant information \" is only a tool to achieve \" mutual assistance \". [ 1 ] Other activities enabling real cooperation among SAs are \" supervisory measures, such as requests to carry out prior authorisations and consultations, inspections and investigations \". [ 2 ] Article 61(2) GDPR requires SAs to take all necessary measures to respond to requests for mutual assistance made by other SAs. This means, first of all, that the receiving SA is required to have adequate organisational measures in place to process the request internally and to follow it up fully, by any action deemed necessary. The request must also be responded to in a timely manner. In particular, the requested SA shall reply without delay and, in any event, no later than one month after receipt of the request. The wording indicates that, in principle, the answer shall not consist of a mere update but rather the outcome of the requested activities. However, it seems entirely foreseeable that the deadline will not be met in some cases, especially if the requested activities involve dealing with third parties or complex investigation operations. [ 3 ] The request for administrative assistance must contain all the information necessary to enable the requested SA to comply with it without delay. The GDPR stipulates that the information includes the purpose and reasons for the request. Therefore, the requested information must be tailored to the subject matter of the request and can only be used in context of that request. However, scholars suggest that the requirement should not be interpreted in an overly restrictive fashion. For example, the request (and the information it implies) may well trigger ex-officio investigations (on both sides). [ 4 ] The requested SA shall not refuse to comply with the request unless (a) it is not competent for the subject matter of the request or for the measures it is requested to execute, or (b) compliance with the request would infringe the GDPR or Union or Member State law to which the SA receiving the request is subject. Some authors convincingly argue that letter (b) contains letter (a) because the competence of the SA is regulated either by European or national law. [ 5 ] Therefore, a request for administrative assistance may only be refused if the requested SA is forced to act unlawfully, either under Union or domestic legislation. However, the domestic law that limits the obligation to provide administrative assistance must, for its part, conform with Union law. In particular, the regulation does not authorise the Member States to create further grounds for refusing administrative assistance. [ 6 ] In any case, according to paragraph 5 below, the requested SA shall provide reasons for any refusal to comply with a request under paragraph 4. Article 61(5) GDPR seems to require the requested SA to communicate the results of the request or, if not possible (see paragraph 2 above), at least an update on the progress of the procedure, in particular by making clear which \" measures [have been] taken in order to respond \". [ 7 ] Article 61(5)(2) GDPR imposes an obligation on the requested SA to give reasons if a request for administrative assistance is rejected. The mere assertion of a possible legal violation is not sufficient in this respect. Rather, the requested SA must substantiate why it cannot comply with the request. In the event of rejection due to lack of competence, the principle of genuine cooperation between the SAs requires the requested authority to inform the requesting authority of the competent authority. [ 8 ] Article 61(6) GDPR sets out the principle of electronic communication between the SAs without excluding other forms of communication (\" as a rule \"). In urgent cases, for example, information can also be transmitted by telephone or by other means. Mutual assistance requests shall be carried out free of charge. The idea behind the exemption from fees is that the proper implementation of Union law is a matter of common interest (Article 197(1) TFEU). It is argued that costs for administrative assistance of the individual Member States converge or offset each other in the long term. Therefore, mutual invoicing of individual administrative assistance would only generate additional administrative effort, but no additional income. [ 9 ] However, in exceptional circumstances, SAs can arrange agreements to indemnify each other for specific expenditures arising from the provision of mutual assistance. These include, for example, expenses for experts or interpreters or expenses in the event of particular difficulties with administrative assistance. [ 10 ] According to Article 61(8)(1) GDPR, if, within one month of receiving the request, the requested SA does not inform the requesting SA of the results or, as the case may be, of the progress of the measures taken in order to respond to the request (Article 61(5) GDPR), the requesting SA may adopt a provisional measure on the territory of its Member State under Article 55(1) GDPR. If the SA does not meet the deadline, the consequences seem to be two, both of them derogatory to the standard procedure set forth by Article 66 GDPR. First, the SA does not have to prove the urgency required by Article 66(1) GDPR for \" normal \" urgency cases (the urgency \" shall be presumed \"). Second, the provisional measure will be subject to an \" urgent binding decision from the Board \". This second consequence is also exceptional because, as opposed to Article 66(2) GDPR, under which the SA may request either a binding or non-binding decision from the EDPB, in this case, there is no choice: there will be an assessment by the EDPB the outcome of which will be binding. The Commission may, by means of implementing acts, specify the format and procedures for mutual assistance referred to in Article 61 GDPR and the arrangements for the exchange of information by electronic means between supervisory authorities, and between SAs and the Board, in particular, the standardised format referred to in Article 61(6) GDPR. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2) GDPR. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 61 GDPR \u2191 It is therefore a simple case of poor legislative technique. See, Polenz , in Simitis, Hornung, Spiecker, Datenschutzrecht, Article 61 GDPR, margin number 7 (C.H. Beck 2019, 1st ed.) \u2191 Polenz , in Simitis, Hornung, Spiecker, Datenschutzrecht, Article 61 GDPR, margin number 7 (Beck 2019, 1st ed.), who clarifies that the requested SA can be asked, for example, to exercise authorisation under Article 58(3) or to carry out investigations in the form of data protection reviews in accordance with Article 58(1)(b) GDPR. \u2191 K\u00f6rffer in Paal, Pauly, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 61 GDPR, margin number 4 (Beck 2021, 3rd ed.). \u2191 Dix , in K\u00fchling, Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 61 GDPR, margin number 12 (Beck 2020, 3rd ed.). \u2191 Dix , in K\u00fchling, Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 61 GDPR, margin number 13 (Beck 2020, 3rd edition). \u2191 Dix , in K\u00fchling, Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 61 GDPR, margin number 13 (Beck 2020, 3rd edition). \u2191 On this point, we would like to point out that, unlike what happens in Article 57(f) GDPR, under which the data subject is entitled to know the \"progress and the outcome of the investigation\", Article 61 GDPR seems to require higher-level accountability for inter-SAs communications. \u2191 Peuker in Sydow, Europ\u00e4ische Datenschutzgrundverordnung, Article 61 GDPR, margin number 39 (Beck 2018, 2nd edition). \u2191 Peuker in Sydow, Europ\u00e4ische Datenschutzgrundverordnung, Article 61 GDPR, margin number 42 (Beck 2018, 2nd edition). \u2191 Peuker in Sydow, Europ\u00e4ische Datenschutzgrundverordnung, Article 61 GDPR, margin number 44 (Beck 2018, 2nd edition).",

The supervisory authorities shall, where appropriate, conduct joint operations including joint investigations and joint enforcement measures in which members or staff of the supervisory authorities of other Member States are involved. 2.   Where the controller or processor has establishments in several Member States or where a significant number of data subjects in more than one Member State are likely to be substantially affected by processing operations, a supervisory authority of each of those Member States shall have the right to participate in joint operations. The supervisory authority which is competent pursuant to Article 56(1) or (4) shall invite the supervisory authority of each of those Member States to take part in the joint operations and shall respond without delay to the request of a supervisory authority to participate. 3.   A supervisory authority may, in accordance with Member State law, and with the seconding supervisory authority's authorisation, confer powers, including investigative powers on the seconding supervisory authority's members or staff involved in joint operations or, in so far as the law of the Member State of the host supervisory authority permits, allow the seconding supervisory authority's members or staff to exercise their investigative powers in accordance with the law of the Member State of the seconding supervisory authority. Such investigative powers may be exercised only under the guidance and in the presence of members or staff of the host supervisory authority. The seconding supervisory authority's members or staff shall be subject to the Member State law of the host supervisory authority. 4.   Where, in accordance with paragraph 1, staff of a seconding supervisory authority operate in another Member State, the Member State of the host supervisory authority shall assume responsibility for their actions, including liability, for any damage caused by them during their operations, in accordance with the law of the Member State in whose territory they are operating. 5.   The Member State in whose territory the damage was caused shall make good such damage under the conditions applicable to damage caused by its own staff. The Member State of the seconding supervisory authority whose staff has caused damage to any person in the territory of another Member State shall reimburse that other Member State in full any sums it has paid to the persons entitled on their behalf. 6.   Without prejudice to the exercise of its rights vis-\u00e0-vis third parties and with the exception of paragraph 5, each Member State shall refrain, in the case provided for in paragraph 1, from requesting reimbursement from another Member State in relation to damage referred to in paragraph 4. 7.   Where a joint operation is intended and a supervisory authority does not, within one month, comply with the obligation laid down in the second sentence of paragraph 2 of this Article, the other supervisory authorities may adopt a provisional measure on the territory of its Member State in accordance with Article 55. In that case, the urgent need to act under Article 66(1) shall be presumed to be met and require an opinion or an urgent binding decision from the Board pursuant to Article 66(2). In terms of EU law, joint operations are not a new phenomenon. Forms of horizontal and vertical cooperation are, in fact, already provided for in other fields of EU law. Joint operations have intensified, for example, around \u200b\u200bpolice cooperation for the cross-border fight against terrorism and crime through the so-called 'Pr\u00fcm Decision'. Article 17 of the Pr\u00fcm Decision, on which Article 62 GDPR has been partly modelled, regulates common forms of cooperation (e.g. joint patrols with police officers from different Member States, and control, evaluation or observation groups) and allows foreign officials to exercise sovereign powers in the hosting State under certain conditions. The main objective of joint operations is, of course, the joint fulfilment of tasks. However, they also increase transparency, develop mutual trust between the authorities as well as common enforcement standards. Ultimately, they substantially contribute to the coherent enforcement of the GDPR (and any other substantive Union law they are foreseen for). [ 1 ] Article 62(1) GDPR provides the legal basis for SAs to conduct joint operations. Joint operations include all the investigative activities within the meaning of Article 58(1) GDPR as well as joint enforcement measures resulting from the exercise of the powers conferred by the GDPR. The broad term \" investigation \" includes on-site inspections, access to the controller or processor's business premises, including access to all data processing systems and equipment as appropriate under the applicable national procedural law. [ 2 ] The expression \" where appropriate \" gives the supervisory authorities (\u201c SA \u201d) a general power to initiate joint operations whenever necessary. [ 3 ] The framework of voluntary cooperation provided for in Article 62(1) GDPR is partly supplemented by Article 62(2) GDPR, which contains several cases in which joint operations become mandatory. [ 4 ] In particular, the SA that is competent under Article 56(1) or (4) GDPR shall invite the SAs of the affected Member States to participate in the joint operations and shall respond without delay to the request of a SA to participate. The obligation to invite (or accept the request of participation) is triggered if either one of the following conditions is met: (i) the controller or processor has establishments in several Member States or (ii) a significant number of data subjects in more than one Member State are likely to be substantially affected by processing operations. In such cases, the lead SA will invite (or will accept the request of participation of) the SAs of the Member States where the controller or processor has an establishment or in which a significant number of data subjects are substantially affected by the processing. According to Article 62(2) GDPR, \u201c a supervisory authority of each of those Member States shall have the right to participate in joint operations \u201d. This right, however, is not absolute. According to the prevailing interpretation, participation may be refused if it is (i) disproportionate, (ii) not justified by minimum standards of seriousness or (iii) may have adverse effects on the interests of the hosting State within the meaning of Article 346(1) TFEU. [ 5 ] Article 62(3) GDPR foresees two main forms of joint operations: (i) conferring national powers to a foreign SA; and (ii) authorising a foreign SA to use its own national powers. If the law of the Member State which is hosting the operations provides so, the host SA may confer powers, including investigative powers, to the visiting SA. In this case, the visiting SA must accept to exercise these powers. Insofar as the law of the Member State of the host SA permits, a SA may allow the seconding SA\u2019s members or staff to exercise their investigative powers under the law of their own Member State. Since the investigative powers of the SAs are largely harmonized by Article 58(1) GDPR, this second type of joint operations only makes sense if the law of the sending State \u2013 based on Article 58(6) GDPR \u2013 contains other or more extensive investigative powers than that law of the host country. No matter which type of joint operation is adopted, investigative powers may be exercised only under the guidance and in the presence of members or staff of the host SA. In this respect, the seconding SA\u2019s members or staff shall be subject to the Member State law of the host SA. [ 6 ] Under Article 62(4) GDPR, when the staff of other SAs are involved, the host SA assumes responsibility for their actions, including liability for damages caused by them, under its national law. This provision, however, is considerably ambiguous. In defining liability for damages, it refers to Article 62(1) GDPR (\u201c in accordance with paragraph 1 \u201d), which, as mentioned above, governs cases of voluntary joint operations. It would therefore seem to exclude cases of compulsory joint operations under Article 62(2) GDPR, which are reasonably more frequent, from the liability rules. According to the wording of the provision, it would thus appear that in the latter case, liability does not fall upon the host Member State. Article 62(5) GDPR stipulates that in the event that the conduct of the seconding SA causes damage to the controller or processor, the host Member State shall be liable for such damage under the same conditions as apply to damage caused by its own staff. In such a case, the host Member State shall have a right of redress against the State of the seconding SA. According to Article 259 TFEU, legal disputes between Member States regarding this compensation can be decided by the CJEU after obtaining an opinion from the Commission. [ 7 ] Without prejudice to the exercise of its rights vis-\u00e0-vis third parties and with the exception of Article 62(5) GDPR, each Member State shall refrain, in the case provided for in paragraph 1, from requesting reimbursement from another Member State in relation to damage referred to in Article 62(4) GDPR. According to Article 62(7) GDPR, if the lead SA does not invite the SA to take part in the joint operations or does not respond promptly to the request of participation, the other SAs may adopt a provisional measure on the territory of their Member State following Article 55 GDPR. In these cases, the consequences seem to be twofold, both of them derogatory to the standard procedure set forth by Article 66 GDPR. First, the SA does not have to prove the urgency required by Article 66(1) GDPR for \u201cnormal\u201d urgency cases (in fact, the urgency \u201c shall be presumed \u201d). Second, the provisional measure will be subject to an \u201c urgent binding decision from the Board \u201d. This second consequence is also exceptional because, as opposed to Article 66(2) GDPR, under which the SA may request either a binding or non-binding decision from the EDPB, in this case, there is no choice: there will be an assessment by the EDPB the outcome of which will be binding. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 62 GDPR \u2191 Peuker in Sydow, Europ\u00e4ische Datenschutzgrundverordnung, Article 62 GDPR, margin number 7 (Beck 2018, 2nd edition). \u2191 Peuker in Sydow, Europ\u00e4ische Datenschutzgrundverordnung, Article 62 GDPR, margin number 11 (Beck 2018, 2nd edition). \u2191 Riccio, Scorza, Belisario, GDPR e normativa privacy \u2013 Commentario, Article 62 GDPR (Wolters Kluwer 2018). \u2191 This is a novelty in European administrative cooperation law as Peuker reports in Sydow, Europ\u00e4ische Datenschutzgrundverordnung, Article 62 GDPR, margin number 13 (Beck 2018, 2nd edition). \u2191 Peuker , in Sydow, Europ\u00e4ische Datenschutzgrundverordnung, Article 62 GDPR, margin numbers 19-20 (Beck 2018, 2nd edition). \u2191 Dix , in K\u00fchling, Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 61 GDPR, margin number 12 (Beck 2020, 3rd edition). \u2191 Klabunde , in Ehman, Selmayr, Datenschutz-Grundverordnung, Article 62 GDPR, margin number 27 (Beck 2018, 2nd edition).",

Member States 3.3 Following a Dispute During the One-stop-shop 4 Decisions 5 References In order to contribute to the consistent application of this Regulation throughout the Union, the supervisory authorities shall cooperate with each other and, where relevant, with the Commission, through the consistency mechanism as set out in this Section. One of the main goals of the GDPR was to solve the problem of having a fragmented system of EU data protection rules, which the DPD had not been able to prevent from happening. In this respect, it was crucial to implement a system which would eventually ensure a consistent interpretation of such rules in the same way. The GDPR now foresees a consistency mechanism which pursues two main objectives. First, it seeks to \u201c ensure that all DPAs interpret and apply the GDPR in a consistent, harmonious and uniform manner \u201d. Second, it assists in solving disputes which may arise \u201ceither between the DPAs over the course of the one-stop-shop mechanism [...], or when a DPA disregards or fails to seek the opinion of the EDPB in those cases where it is required by the consistency mechanism \u201d. [ 1 ] The authority tasked with such an important role is the European Data Protection Board (EDPB). The ultimate goal of ensuring consistency in the European data protection system is implemented through the so-called consistency mechanism, which is triggered in three distinct circumstances, as outlined below. First, under Article 64(1) GDPR, the consistency mechanism is triggered when a supervisory authority (\u201c SA \u201d) plans to adopt a measure intended to produce legal effects as regards processing operations which substantially affect a significant number of data subjects in several Member States. Examples of these measures are standard data protection clauses referred to in Article 46(2)(d) GDPR, contractual clauses referred to in Article 46(3)(a) GDPR, or binding corporate rules within the meaning of Article 47 GDPR. In these cases, the EDPB will issue an opinion on the matter within eight weeks by simple majority. Any SA, the Chair of the EDPB or the Commission may request that any matter of general application or producing effects in more than one Member State be examined by the EDPB with a view to obtaining an opinion, in particular where a competent SA does not comply with the obligations for mutual assistance in accordance with Article 61 GDPR or for joint operations in accordance with Article 62 GDPR. Also in this case, the EDPB will issue an opinion on the matter within eight weeks by simple majority. This mechanism seems to be directly, though not entirely, related to remedying possible dysfunctions of the one-stop-shop. As analysed above, the one-stop-shop provides specific rules for the management of so-called \u201c cross-border cases \u201d. Through these rules, the SAs involved improve cooperation and reduce uncertainty for data subjects and controllers. This mechanism, however, does not prevent a certain SA from abusing its position, for instance by arrogating to itself (wrongly) the role of lead SA or by ignoring relevant and reasoned objections formulated by other SAs. Precisely to remedy the shortcomings or possible problems of the one-stop-shop, the GDPR foresees specific rules with respect to different types of situations. Article 65 GDPR provides for a dispute-resolution procedure in the event that the SA concerned does not comply with Article 64 GDPR mentioned above or that clarification by the EDPB is required for disputes arising during the one-stop-shop. Article 66 GDPR provides for an urgency procedure when, by virtue of exceptional circumstances, a DPA needs to derogate from the one-stop-shop or the consistency mechanism. In this scenario, the EDPB can issue a decision on how to resolve the aforementioned situations. This decision is legally binding on the SAs concerned. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 63 GDPR \u2191 Van Eecke, Simkus , in Kuner et al., The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Article 63 GDPR, p. 998-999 (Oxford University Press 2020).",

The Board shall issue an opinion where a competent supervisory authority intends to adopt any of the measures below. To that end, the competent supervisory authority shall communicate the draft decision to the Board, when it: 2.   Any supervisory authority, the Chair of the Board or the Commission may request that any matter of general application or producing effects in more than one Member State be examined by the Board with a view to obtaining an opinion, in particular where a competent supervisory authority does not comply with the obligations for mutual assistance in accordance with Article 61 or for joint operations in accordance with Article 62. 3.   In the cases referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Board shall issue an opinion on the matter submitted to it provided that it has not already issued an opinion on the same matter. That opinion shall be adopted within eight weeks by simple majority of the members of the Board. That period may be extended by a further six weeks, taking into account the complexity of the subject matter. Regarding the draft decision referred to in paragraph 1 circulated to the members of the Board in accordance with paragraph 5, a member which has not objected within a reasonable period indicated by the Chair, shall be deemed to be in agreement with the draft decision. 4.   Supervisory authorities and the Commission shall, without undue delay, communicate by electronic means to the Board, using a standardised format any relevant information, including as the case may be a summary of the facts, the draft decision, the grounds which make the enactment of such measure necessary, and the views of other supervisory authorities concerned. 5.   The Chair of the Board shall, without undue, delay inform by electronic means: 6.   The competent supervisory authority shall not adopt its draft decision referred to in paragraph 1 within the period referred to in paragraph 3. 7.   The supervisory authority referred to in paragraph 1 shall take utmost account of the opinion of the Board and shall, within two weeks after receiving the opinion, communicate to the Chair of the Board by electronic means whether it will maintain or amend its draft decision and, if any, the amended draft decision, using a standardised format. 8.   Where the supervisory authority concerned informs the Chair of the Board within the period referred to in paragraph 7 of this Article that it does not intend to follow the opinion of the Board, in whole or in part, providing the relevant grounds, Article 65(1) shall apply. Section 2 of Chapter VII, the GDPR introduces a so-called \u201c consistency mechanism \u201d to ensure the consistent application of the GDPR by the supervisory authorities (\u201c SA \u201d). In order to empower the European Data Protection Board (\u201c EDPB \u201d) to fulfil this task, Article 64 GDPR includes an opinion procedure which can be triggered in two types of situations: First, when a SA prepares a draft decision in a selected range of cases that require the EDPB\u2019s opinion (Article 64(1) GDPR). Second, when a SA, the EDPB Chair, or the Commission request the EDPB to issue an opinion on any other matter (Article 64(2) GDPR). The remaining paragraphs of Article 64(3)-(8) GDPR lay down substantive rules and a detailed procedure for the EDPB\u2019s opinions. Article 64(1) GDPR formulates a list of cases that require a mandatory opinion by the EDPB in view of their nature \u2013 there is a considerable need for a harmonised implementation of the issues they deal with across the EU. [ 1 ] These issues are: (a) the adoption of a list of the processing operations subject to the requirement for a data protection impact assessment; (b) a decision on whether a draft code of conduct is compliant with the GDPR; (c) a decision which will approve requirements for accreditation or certification bodies; (d) a decision which will determine standard data protection clauses; (e) a decision that will authorise contractual clauses; (f) or a decision approving binding corporate rules. If one of the situations listed in this paragraph has been triggered, a SA that intends to issue a decision shall submit a draft decision to the EDPB to obtain an opinion. The validity of the relevant SA\u2019s decision will depend on the opinion of the EDPB. The opinions of the EDPB are not directly binding on the SAs. However, the SAs are obliged to notify the EDPB if they intend to deviate from the opinion in order to ensure a possibility to trigger a binding dispute resolution procedure in accordance with Article 65 GDPR. [ 2 ] Article 64(2) GDPR allows any SA, the EDPB Chair or the Commission to request the EDPB to issue an opinion in cases which are not included in the list from 64(1) GDPR, but which address issues having a general application or producing effects in more than one Member State. This provision potentially allows for a wide array of issues to be brought up before the EDPB depending on the interpretation of Article 64(2) GDPR. The EDPB, however, seems to have adopted a narrow interpretation of this provision requiring the issue at stake to be an abstract, substantive, and legal issue that is independent of any particular case or cases. [ 3 ] The refusal by the EDPB to issue an opinion in cases which fulfil the necessary criteria, shall take a form of a formal decision by the EDPB. A SA will then be able to submit such a decision for the review of the legality of such a decision to the CJEU. [ 4 ] Early drafts of the GDPR foresaw giving the Commission the power to enforce the GDPR by means of implementing acts. However, as some authors indicate, granting the Commission such a power was seen as a violation of the independence of the SAs. Therefore, the final decision-making powers and the Commission\u2019s role within the consistency mechanism were significantly reduced, leaving to the Commission the power to request from the EDPB to issue an opinion under Article 64(2) GDPR. Article 64(3) GDPR provides that the EDPB shall adopt an opinion within eight weeks by a simple majority vote. In more complex cases, this period may be extended by another six weeks, allowing for 14 weeks in total. The Chair of the EDPB makes decisions about the extension either on its own initiative or at the request of at least one third of the Board\u2019s members. Prior to the adoption of the opinion, the EDPB shall evaluate whether the request fulfils the requirements of 64(1) and (2) GDPR, and whether the EDPB has not already issued an opinion on the same matter in the past. The EDPB Secretariat prepares a draft opinion and presents it for approval to the Board. The EDPB Chair can also invite a rapporteur and expert subgroups to assist with the preparation of the draft opinion. The Board may adopt an opinion in favour of a draft decision submitted to the EDPB under Article 64(1) GDPR if none of the members of the Board objected to it (a \u201c non-objection-procedure \u201d). However, if at least one member of the Board objects to the draft decision, the obligation of the EPDB to examine the objection and prepare an opinion on the draft decision shall immediately be triggered. When objecting, members of the Board should provide reasons for their objections. [ 5 ] Article 64(4) and (5) GDPR contain the rules on communication between the EDPB, the SAs, and the Commission. The rules require the respective applicant to provide all relevant information to the EDPB without undue delay and by electronic means. After analysing the submitted documents, the EDPB secretariat may request to provide additional information to complete the file. Article 64(5) GDPR contains a comprehensive information obligation on the Chair of the EDPB about the draft opinion. The Chair shall inform the EDPB members of any relevant information received from the SA or from the Commission, as well as of the adopted opinion. The opinion shall be made public. Article 64(6)-(8) GDPR put forward the rules for SAs during and after the adoption of the opinion by the EDPB. The SA which submitted its draft decision to the EDPB according to Article 64(1) GDPR shall inform the EDPB within two weeks after receiving the opinion whether they will maintain or amend their draft decision. If the latter is the case, they should send to the EDPB the amended draft of the decision. If the SA decides not to uphold the opinion of the EDPB, it shall notify the EDPB about the reasons not to do so. In this case, any SA or the European Commission may initiate the dispute resolution procedure (according to Article 65(1)(c) GDPR). If the dispute resolution procedure is not triggered, the SA may decide to deviate from the EDPB\u2019s opinion in whole or in part providing the reasons. However, the provisions leave it open to decide how long the SA shall wait to see whether the dispute resolution procedure is initiated before it issues a final decision. [ 6 ] When the opinion of the EDPB is mandatory (in cases listed under Article 64(1) GDPR), the legality of a subsequent measure taken by the SA in question will depend on the validity of the opinion of the EDPB. Consequently, a failure to obtain a valid opinion from the EDPB will lead to an illegal draft decision which is not effective. [ 7 ] The obligation of the SA to notify the EDPB about upholding the opinion enables the EDPB to monitor the uniformity of the GDPR enforcement across the Member States.

In order to ensure the correct and consistent application of this Regulation in individual cases, the Board shall adopt a binding decision in the following cases: 2.   The decision referred to in paragraph 1 shall be adopted within one month from the referral of the subject-matter by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Board. That period may be extended by a further month on account of the complexity of the subject-matter. The decision referred to in paragraph 1 shall be reasoned and addressed to the lead supervisory authority and all the supervisory authorities concerned and binding on them. 3.   Where the Board has been unable to adopt a decision within the periods referred to in paragraph 2, it shall adopt its decision within two weeks following the expiration of the second month referred to in paragraph 2 by a simple majority of the members of the Board. Where the members of the Board are split, the decision shall by adopted by the vote of its Chair. 4.   The supervisory authorities concerned shall not adopt a decision on the subject matter submitted to the Board under paragraph 1 during the periods referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3. 5.   The Chair of the Board shall notify, without undue delay, the decision referred to in paragraph 1 to the supervisory authorities concerned. It shall inform the Commission thereof. The decision shall be published on the website of the Board without delay after the supervisory authority has notified the final decision referred to in paragraph 6. 6.   The lead supervisory authority or, as the case may be, the supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged shall adopt its final decision on the basis of the decision referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, without undue delay and at the latest by one month after the Board has notified its decision. The lead supervisory authority or, as the case may be, the supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged, shall inform the Board of the date when its final decision is notified respectively to the controller or the processor and to the data subject. The final decision of the supervisory authorities concerned shall be adopted under the terms of Article 60(7), (8) and (9). The final decision shall refer to the decision referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article and shall specify that the decision referred to in that paragraph will be published on the website of the Board in accordance with paragraph 5 of this Article. The final decision shall attach the decision referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article. 8.   By derogation from paragraph 7, where a complaint is dismissed or rejected, the supervisory authority with which the complaint was lodged shall adopt the decision and notify it to the complainant and shall inform the controller thereof. 9.   Where the lead supervisory authority and the supervisory authorities concerned agree to dismiss or reject parts of a complaint and to act on other parts of that complaint, a separate decision shall be adopted for each of those parts of the matter. The lead supervisory authority shall adopt the decision for the part concerning actions in relation to the controller, shall notify it to the main establishment or single establishment of the controller or processor on the territory of its Member State and shall inform the complainant thereof, while the supervisory authority of the complainant shall adopt the decision for the part concerning dismissal or rejection of that complaint, and shall notify it to that complainant and shall inform the controller or processor thereof. 10.   After being notified of the decision of the lead supervisory authority pursuant to paragraphs 7 and 9, the controller or processor shall take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with the decision as regards processing activities in the context of all its establishments in the Union. The controller or processor shall notify the measures taken for complying with the decision to the lead supervisory authority, which shall inform the other supervisory authorities concerned. 11.   Where, in exceptional circumstances, a supervisory authority concerned has reasons to consider that there is an urgent need to act in order to protect the interests of data subjects, the urgency procedure referred to in Article 66 shall apply. 12.   The lead supervisory authority and the other supervisory authorities concerned shall supply the information required under this Article to each other by electronic means, using a standardised format. Any natural or legal person has the right to bring an action for annulment of decisions of the Board before the Court of Justice under the conditions provided for in Article 263 TFEU. As addressees of such decisions, the supervisory authorities concerned which wish to challenge them have to bring action within two months of being notified of them, in accordance with Article 263 TFEU. Where decisions of the Board are of direct and individual concern to a controller, processor or complainant, the latter may bring an action for annulment against those decisions within two months of their publication on the website of the Board, in accordance with Article 263 TFEU. Without prejudice to this right under Article 263 TFEU, each natural or legal person should have an effective judicial remedy before the competent national court against a decision of a supervisory authority which produces legal effects concerning that person. Such a decision concerns in particular the exercise of investigative, corrective and authorisation powers by the supervisory authority or the dismissal or rejection of complaints. However, the right to an effective judicial remedy does not encompass measures taken by supervisory authorities which are not legally binding, such as opinions issued by or advice provided by the supervisory authority. Proceedings against a supervisory authority should be brought before the courts of the Member State where the supervisory authority is established and should be conducted in accordance with that Member State's procedural law. Those courts should exercise full jurisdiction, which should include jurisdiction to examine all questions of fact and law relevant to the dispute before them. Article 65 GDPR enables the EDPB to adopt binding decisions in cases where the supervisory authorities (\u201c SA \u201d) cannot agree on some elements of interpretation of the GDPR: when the lead SA does not follow a reasoned objection of a SA (Article 65(1)(a) GDPR), when there are different views on which SA is the lead SA (\u201c LSA \u201d) (Article 65(1)(b) GDPR), and where a SA is not following an opinion of the EDPB (Article 6(1)(c) GDPR). Article 65(1)(a) GDPR addresses the cases where a consensus could not be reached within the consistency mechanism under Article 60 GDPR . This dispute resolution mechanism shall be activated when a relevant and reasoned objection by a concerned SA (\u201c CSA \u201d) is raised and not followed by the LSA. For the definition of a relevant and reasoned objection see commentary on Article 4(24) GDPR and EDPB Guidelines 09/2020. [ 1 ] If the LSA does not intend to follow the objection(s) or considers the objection(s) are not relevant and reasoned, the LSA is obliged to refer the case to the EDPB for dispute resolution. The procedure and scope of Article 65(1)(a) GDPR have also been further developed by the EPDB in Guidelines 03/2021. [ 2 ] In particular, the EDPB binding decision should only concern the matters which are subject to the relevant and reasoned objection(s) of the CSAs. When a LSA refers a dispute to the EDPB for resolution in accordance with Articles 60(4) and 63 GDPR, the EDPB must first assess whether the objection(s) raised in fact meet the conditions of being relevant and reasoned. In order for an objection to be considered as \u201c relevant \u201d, there must be a direct connection between the objection and the substance of the draft decision at issue. The EDPB refers to some examples where a possible disagreement between the LSA and the CSAs can arise: the existence of a given infringement of the GDPR, the existence of additional or alternative infringements of the GDPR, gaps in the draft decision justifying the need for further investigation, insufficient factual information or reasoning, procedural aspects, or the specific action envisaged by the draft decision. [ 3 ] In case the relevant and reasoned objections by CSAs refer to the scope of the investigation (i.e. the LSA set the scope to narrow), the EDPB is not only competent to deal with this issue but also to require the LSA to undertake further investigation. [ 4 ] On 9 November 2020, the EDPB adopted its first decision under the dispute resolution mechanism laid down by Article 65 GDPR. [ 5 ] The binding decision seeks to address the dispute which arose following a draft decision issued by the Irish SA as LSA regarding Twitter and the subsequent relevant and reasoned objections expressed by a number of CSAs. As the LSA rejected the objections and/or considered they were not \u201crelevant and reasoned\u201d, it referred the matter to the EDPB in accordance with Art 60 (4) GDPR, thereby initiating the dispute resolution procedure. In this decision, the EDPB confirmed its interpretation of the notion of relevant and reasoned objection under Article 4(24) GDPR, considering that CSAs should show why the draft decision, if it was unchanged, would pose significant risks for the rights and freedoms of data subjects and/or the free flow of data. The majority of the objections raised on the substance and on the failure to impose a reprimand were dismissed on this ground. The EDPB also required the Irish DPA to re-assess the elements to calculate the amount of the fixed fine to be imposed on twitter. The Irish DPA adopted its final decision on 9 December 2020. [ 6 ] More binding decisions can be found here . [ 7 ] EDPB Guidelines: On this provision, please see Guidelines 01/2020 on processing personal data in the context of connected vehicles and mobility related applications Article 65(1)(b) GDPR provides for a dispute resolution mechanism where SAs do not agree on which one of them is the LSA. Although Recital 136 GDPR only refers to disputes between the SAs (\u201c the Board should be empowered to adopt legally binding decisions where there are disputes between supervisory authorities \u201d), the wording of Article 65(1)(b) GDPR does not exclude other interested parties, such as controllers, processors, or complainants, from the procedure before the EDPB. In its decision regarding Twitter, the EDPB considered that the question of the competence of the LSA falls outside of the scope of Article 65(1)(a) GDPR. This specific issue should be addressed under the specific procedure laid down in Article 65(1)(b) GDPR. [ 8 ] One can therefore conclude that Article 65(2) GDPR can be invoked by a controller or a complainant who would not agree with the designation of the LSA. [ 9 ] Another question is, at which stage of the procedure this question can be asked. It is possible that the designation of the LSA will only be communicated to the controller or the complainant at a later stage of the procedure, or even together with the final decision on the merits. Article 65(1)(c) GDPR concerns the third case where the EDPB can adopt a binding decision: when a SA does not ask the opinion of the EDPB under Article 64 GDPR, or does not follow an opinion of the EDPB adopted as per this last provision. This provision is remarkable since the opinions of the EDPB are not supposed to be binding. However, Article 65(8) GDPR already states that when the SA intends not to follow the opinion of the EDPB, Article 65(1) GDPR shall apply. [ 10 ] That means that the opinion might become binding, at the condition that the two-third majority required in principle (see hereunder Article 65(2) GDPR) to adopt a decision under Article 65 GDPR is reached, since Article 64 GDPR only requires a simple majority. The procedure under Article 65(1)(c) GDPR can be triggered by the Commission or any SA (in the sense of Article 4(22) GDPR). The decision shall be adopted by the EDPB within a deadline of one month from the \u201c referral of the subject-matter \u201d. The Rules of Procedure (\u201c RoP \u201d) of the EDPB provide that the decision shall be adopted one month after the Chair and the SA/Commission/EFTA Surveillance authority have decided that the file is complete. [ 11 ] The deadline shall be extended by another month taking into account the complexity of the matter, upon decision of the Chair of the EDPB or at the request of at least one third of the members of the EDPB. [ 12 ] During the procedure, the EDPB will have to make sure that the right to be heard is respected. The right to be heard before an administration implements a measure that would adversely affect a person is enshrined in Article 41 CFEU and also included in Article 16 of the European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour and reflected in Article 11 of the RoP of the EDPB. According to the EDPB, \u201c As a result, any of these persons which would be adversely affected by the decision, in particular the controller(s) and/or processor(s) who are addressed by the draft decision of the LSA, as well as any other person which would be adversely affected by the decision, must be afforded the right to be heard in relation to the subject matter which is brought before the EDPB pursuant to Articles 60(4), 63 and 65(1)(a) GDPR\u201d . [ 13 ] However, we share the doubts of Hijmans about the compliance of the RoP of the EDPB with Article 41 CFR. [ 14 ] Finally, the decision shall be adopted by a two-third majority of the members. The provision does not say whether the vote shall be made public or not, but it seems that the EDPB does not even provide for the possibility to record the names of the members voting in favour or against a document, since the RoP only refer to the \u201c numerical result of the vote \u201d. [ 15 ] The decision shall be reasoned (in accordance with Article 41 CFR) and binding on all SAs concerned and addressed to the LSA. When no decision can adopted with a majority of two thirds by the EDPB within the extended period of two months, the EDPB can adopt the decision by simple majority. When the votes are split among the members, the vote of the Chair will be decisive. SAs shall refrain from adopting any decision concerning the subject-matter during the period during which the EDPB is bound to adopt a decision. However, the GDPR does not say anything about the case where the EDPB does not adopt a decision at all during the said period. It appears that the LSA or the SA concerned could adopt a final decision in such a case. The decision adopted by the EDPB should be notified to the SAs concerned (\u201c CSA \u201d), which usually means the LSA and the SA concerned, by the procedure in the case of Article 65(1)(a) GDPR. However, the definition of SA concerned is less clear in the case of a binding decision adopted under Article 65(1)(b) and (c) GDPR. The decision should be published on the website of the EDPB without undue delay, which should mean that the publication should happen on the same day that the final national decision is notified to the controller, the processor or the complainant by the LSA or the CSA. [ 16 ] The publication of the decision on the website will trigger the deadline for the controllers, processors and complainants to file an action against the decision of the EDPB before the CJEU, as per Article 263 TFEU. [ 17 ] The LSA will adopt the decision within one month after the notification of the decision by the EDPB. Should a decision be adopted by the CSA, they should ideally be adopted simultaneously, and the Chair of the EDPB should be informed thereof, in order to publish the decision on the website of the EDPB on the same day. Indeed, the deadline to appeal the EDPB decision will be triggered on the day of the publication of the decision or the day of the notification, as per Article 263 TFEU. According to Article 263 TFEU, any legal or natural person can bring an action for annulment before the CJEU against a decision which is of direct and individual concern to them. The deadline to bring the action is two months after the publication (for the controllers, processors and complainants) or the notification of the decision (for the SAs). That means that not only the controller, processor or complainant can challenge the decision of the EDPB but also its members, and in particular the LSA and the CSAs involved in the one-stop-shop procedure. The decision of the LSA (and in some cases of the CSA) shall refer to the decision of the EDPB, but Article 65(6) GDPR does not specify that the decision of the EDPB should be attached to the national decision. The final national decisions can also be appealed before the national courts, as per Article 78 GDPR which confirms the right to have a judicial remedy against a decision of a SA. Where proceedings are brought against a decision of a SA that was preceded by an opinion or a decision of the Board in the consistency mechanism, the SA shall forward that opinion or decision to the court. [ 18 ] In the context of judicial remedies, national courts that consider a decision on the question necessary to enable them to give judgment, may, or in the case provided for in Article 267 TFEU, must, request the CJEU to give a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of Union law, including the GDPR. In particular, where a decision of a SA implementing a decision of the EDPB is challenged before a national court and the validity of the decision of the EDPB is at issue, that national court must refer the question of validity to the CJEU in accordance with Article 267 TFEU, should it consider the decision invalid. According to Recital 143 GDPR, however, a national court may not refer a question on the validity of the decision of the EDPB at the request of a natural or legal person which had the opportunity to bring an action for annulment of that decision, in particular if they were directly and individually concerned by that decision, but had not done so within the period laid down in Article 263 TFEU. This statement is criticised by Hijmans, especially considering that the scope of the decision of the EDPB is not the same as the scope of the decision of the national SA. [ 19 ] The final decisions of the SA shall be published on the website of the EDPB, as per Article 70(1)(y) GDPR, which requires that the EDPB maintains a publicly available electronic register of decisions of SAs and courts on issues handled in the consistency mechanisms. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 65 GDPR \u2191 EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 9/2020 on relevant and reasoned objection under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 9 March 2021 (Version 2.0), (available here ). \u2191 EDPB, Guidelines 03/2021 on the application of Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, 13 April 2021 (available here ). \u2191 EDPB, Guidelines 03/2021 on the application of Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, 13 April 2021, margin number 70 (available here ). \u2191 GC, Joint Cases T\u201170/23, T\u201184/23 and T\u2011111/23, DPC v.

Furthermore, in order to avoid divergent decisions, Article 64(2) of the GDPR provides for the possibility for a supervisory authority which considers that transfers of data to a third country must, in general, be prohibited, to refer the matter to the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) for an opinion, which may, under Article 65(1)(c) of the GDPR, adopt a binding decision, in particular where a supervisory authority does not follow the opinion issued .\u201d \u2191 EDPB, Rules of Procedure, 8 October 2020, Articles 11.2, 11.3 and 11.4 (available here ). \u2191 EDPB, Rules of Procedure, 8 October 2020, Article 11.4 (available here ). \u2191 EDPB, Guidelines 03/2021 on the application of Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, (13 April 2021), margin number 99 (available here ). \u2191 Hijmans , in Kuner et al., The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Article 65 GDPR, p. 1023 (Oxford University Press 2020). \u2191 EDPB, Rules of Procedure, 8 October 2020, Article 21.2 (available here ). \u2191 EDPB, Guidelines 03/2021 on the application of Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, (13 April 2021), margin number 57 (available here ). \u2191 See also Recital 143 GDPR. \u2191 See Article 78(2) GDPR. \u2191 Hijmans , in Kuner et al., The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Article 65 GDPR, p. 1025 (Oxford University Press 2020).",

In exceptional circumstances, where a supervisory authority concerned considers that there is an urgent need to act in order to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects, it may, by way of derogation from the consistency mechanism referred to in Articles 63, 64 and 65 or the procedure referred to in Article 60, immediately adopt provisional measures intended to produce legal effects on its own territory with a specified period of validity which shall not exceed three months. The supervisory authority shall, without delay, communicate those measures and the reasons for adopting them to the other supervisory authorities concerned, to the Board and to the Commission. 2.   Where a supervisory authority has taken a measure pursuant to paragraph 1 and considers that final measures need urgently be adopted, it may request an urgent opinion or an urgent binding decision from the Board, giving reasons for requesting such opinion or decision. 3.   Any supervisory authority may request an urgent opinion or an urgent binding decision, as the case may be, from the Board where a competent supervisory authority has not taken an appropriate measure in a situation where there is an urgent need to act, in order to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects, giving reasons for requesting such opinion or decision, including for the urgent need to act. 4.   By derogation from Article 64(3) and Article 65(2), an urgent opinion or an urgent binding decision referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article shall be adopted within two weeks by simple majority of the members of the Board. Article 66 GDPR provides for an exception to the cooperation mechanism. Under certain conditions, mostly related to reasons of urgency and the need to protect the rights of the data subject, the supervisory authority (\u201c SA \u201d) is given the possibility to adopt provisional measures valid on its territory. The same article also provides some specific rules for the intervention of the EDPB and the timing of its decision. In exceptional circumstances, where a SA concerned (\u201c CSA \u201d) (Article 4(22) GDPR) considers that there is an urgent need to act in order to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects, it may, by way of derogation from the consistency mechanism (Articles 60, 63, 64 and 65 GDPR) immediately adopt provisional measures intended to produce legal effects on its own territory. Article 66 GDPR creates strict conditions for cross-border cases when a SA wishes to act on its own without consulting the other CSAs. Three conditions must be fulfilled in this regard, namely (1) exceptional circumstances, (2) an urgent need to act and (3) the need for protection of the rights and freedoms of data subjects. [ 1 ] The latter is fulfilled if a concrete and immediate damage or disadvantage is to be expected. [ 2 ] In such cases, the SA [ 3 ] can adopt a measure which is limited to its territory and the duration of which cannot be longer than three months. [ 4 ] This decision must be motivated and communicated to the Commission and the EDPB and to the \u201c other SAs concerned \u201d. [ 5 ] The GDPR foresees two cases where the urgency requirement is presumed, namely when a SA does not answer within one month to a request for mutual assistance (Article 61(8) GDPR) or to a request of joint operations (Article 62(7) GDPR). [ 6 ] On 12 July 2021, the EDPB adopted an urgent binding decision under Article 66 GDPR, at the request of the Hamburg SA which adopted provisional measures under Article 66(1) GDPR, based on its consideration that the circumstances were exceptional and there was an urgent need to act to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects. [ 7 ] The Hamburg SA considered that the urgency requirement was presumed, as specifically stated by Article 61(8) GDPR. However, the Hamburg SA had made some specific requests through the IMI system by using, in particular, the VMA channel (Voluntary Mutual Assistance). According to the interpretation provided by the EDPB, \u201c[u] nlike formal Article 61 GDPR requests, the SA receiving a VMA request does not have a legal obligation to answer to that request \u201d. [ 8 ] Therefore, the EDPB considered that the urgency was not established considering that the Hamburg SA \u201c did not formally launch an Article 61 GDPR request in the IMI system to the LSA, but merely sent a letter replying to the VMA request flow initiated by the IE SA \u201d . Furthermore, the urgency needed to be demonstrated under Article 66(2) GDPR, which could not be done in the present case. [ 9 ] When the SA that has adopted the provisional measure under Article 66(1) GDPR considers that a final decision should be adopted, it should refer the matter to the EDPB, which shall adopt an urgent opinion or urgent decision. The reasons for asking such a final decision should clearly be substantiated by the requesting SA. [ 10 ] In the cases foreseen by Articles 61(8) and 62(7) GDPR, the reference to the EDPB is mandatory. [ 11 ] The authority addressed under Article 66(1)-(2) GDPR is the CSA within the meaning of Article 4(22) GDPR. In contrast, Article 66(3) refers to \u201c any supervisory authority \u201d (Article 4(21) GDPR) and allows it to request an urgent opinion or an urgent binding decision from the EDPB where a CSA has not taken an appropriate measure in a situation where there is an urgent need to act, in order to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects. As a derogation to the \u201c regular \u201d procedure to be followed to adopt opinions and decisions under Articles 64(3) and 65(2) GDPR, the deadline for the EDPB to adopt the decision or opinion shall be reduced to two weeks, and a simple majority will be needed (instead of a two-third majority in the cases of Article 65(2) GDPR). It remains to be seen how the EDPB will be able to deal with multiple cases, should the SA decide to use the possibility offered to them under Article 66 GDPR. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 66 GDPR \u2191 CJEU, C-645/19, 15 June 2021, Facebook Ireland, margin number 59 (available here ). \u2191 Georgieva in Kuner et al, The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): A Commentary, p. 1030 (Oxford University Press 2020). \u2191 Such a SA can of course be a CSA, but also the lead supervisory authority (\u201c LSA \u201d), if the latest considers that the measure should be adopted urgently without going through the cooperation mechanism. \u2191 See e.g., Garante, 22 January 2021, TikTok, Case 9524194 (available here ). \u2191 Georgieva correctly points out that \"[h] owever, the urgent measure can only be addressed when its addressee has either an establishment or a representative in the territory of the SA concerned. This means that the provision does not apply if the SA is 'concerned' by the processing of personal data under Article 4(22)(6) or (c) (i.e. when data subjects are substantially affected or a complaint has been lodged with that SA) but there is no one on its territory against whom the measures can be addressed \". See, Georgieva in Kuner et al, The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): A Commentary, p. 1030 (Oxford University Press 2020). \u2191 Situations in which the urgency of the measures is presumed may cover, for example, cases where an CSA is potentially faced with persistent inertia from the LSA in charge.

The Commission may adopt implementing acts of general scope in order to specify the arrangements for the exchange of information by electronic means between supervisory authorities, and between supervisory authorities and the Board, in particular the standardised format referred to in Article 64. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2). Article 67 GDP provision grants the power to adopt an implementing act to the Commission for the exchange of information not only between the supervisory authorities (\u201c SA \u201d), but also between the SAs and the European Data Protection Board (\u201c EDPB \u201d). The necessity of a reliable and efficient system to communicate, in particular under the cooperation procedure (between SAs) and the consistency mechanism (under the consistency procedure) is vital for the good functioning of the cooperation between the SAs and the EDPB, considering the strict deadlines and the need for enhanced cooperation. The Internal Market Information System (IMI) was chosen as the IT platform to support cooperation and consistency procedures under the GDPR. IMI helps public authorities across the EU to cooperate and exchange information. IMI has been developed by the European Commission\u2019s DG GROW and was adapted to cater for the needs of the GDPR, in close cooperation with the Secretariat of the EDPB and the national SAs. [ 1 ] The IMI system is therefore used to initiate various procedures under the GDPR, such as the identification of the LSA, mutual assistance procedures, or one-stop-shop procedures. [ 2 ] The Commission also adopted an implementing decision on a pilot project to implement the administrative cooperation provisions of the GDPR. [ 3 ] This decision refers to the Administrative cooperation between SAs (covering cooperation under Articles 56, 60, 61 and 62 GDPR) and the administrative cooperation between SAs, the EDPB and the Commission (covering Articles 64 to 66 GDPR). For the purposes of the pilot project, the SAs referred to in Article 51 GDPR and the EDPB shall be considered as \u201c competent authorities \u201d under the IMI Regulation. [ 4 ] The IMI Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012) has also been modified to extend the list of IMI actors (besides the \u201c competent authorities, IMI coordinators and the Commission \u201d) to the \u201c Union bodies, offices and agencies \u201d and to add the GDPR to the Annex listing the provisions on administrative cooperation in union acts that are implemented by means of IMI. [ 5 ] Article 17 of the EDPB Rules of Procedure (RoP) refers to the use of an \u201cInternal information and communication system\u201d, \u201c in particular to support the electronic exchange of documents within the cooperation and the consistency mechanisms \u201d. Article 10 11(1) of the EDPB RoP require the competent SA to send the relevant documents to the secretariat of the EDPB via the IMI IT system. The use of the IMI system to communicate between SAs is therefore made mandatory. Ignoring this requirement can have consequences, since the EDPB already considered that the urgency could not be presumed under Article 61(8) GDPR if the request for mutual assistance was not made under the formal IMI procedure to send a request for mutual assistance to the Irish SA.

The European Data Protection Board (the \u2018Board\u2019) is hereby established as a body of the Union and shall have legal personality. 2.   The Board shall be represented by its Chair. 3.   The Board shall be composed of the head of one supervisory authority of each Member State and of the European Data Protection Supervisor, or their respective representatives. 4.   Where in a Member State more than one supervisory authority is responsible for monitoring the application of the provisions pursuant to this Regulation, a joint representative shall be appointed in accordance with that Member State's law. 5.   The Commission shall have the right to participate in the activities and meetings of the Board without voting right. The Commission shall designate a representative. The Chair of the Board shall communicate to the Commission the activities of the Board. 6.   In the cases referred to in Article 65, the European Data Protection Supervisor shall have voting rights only on decisions which concern principles and rules applicable to the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies which correspond in substance to those of this Regulation. Article 68 GDPR addresses the nature, legal status, and internal composition of the European Data Protection Board (\u201c EDPB \u201d). The EDPB replaces the Article 29 Working Party (\u201c WP29 \u201d), the former advisory body established under Directive 95/46/EC. Notably, the powers granted to the EDPB are far grater than those afforded to its predecessor. The WP29 was constrained to a purely advisory role. However, the EDPB in contrast, has been afforded a wide array duties, including the power to adopt binding decisions pursuant to Article 65 GDPR (Article 70(1)(t) GDPR). [ 1 ] Article 68 GDPR is the first of nine Articles (Articles 68-76 GDPR) governing the EDPB set forth in Section 3 of Chapter VII GDPR. Article 68(1) GDPR, in addition to Recital 139 GDPR, establish the EDPB as a body of the Union with legal personality. The objectives behind granting the EDPB legal personality were rooted in the perceived defficiencies of the WP29. The WP29, likewise acted as an independent body, but as noted, was not granted legal personality. [ 2 ] The WP29's lack of legal personality contributed to what was generally seen as a fragmented application and interpretation of Directive 95/46/EC by supervisory authorities (\u201c SA \u201d). [ 3 ] As Docksey notes, imbuing the EDPB with legal personality serves to \u201c strengthen[s] [its] nature [\u2026] as a governing body in its own right, deriving its legitimacy directly from legislation rather than by delegation from the Commission. In practical terms it means that the Board may take action before the Courts .\u201d [ 4 ] Having legal personality allows for the Board to make legally binding decisions, pursuant to Articles 65 and 70 GDPR. [ 5 ] The EDPB\u2019s status as an Union body is significant in terms of political  and legal accountability, as consequently, it is subject to the oversight of various bodies in the European Union's regulatory framework. These include the following, regarding legal accountability, under Article 263 TFEU, the decisions of the Board may be appealed to the General Court, and under Article 41 CFR the Board is accountable to the European Ombudsman. In terms of political accountability, the EDPB's monetary and administrative decisions are subject to the Court of Auditors pursuant to Article 287 TFEU. More generally, it is accountable to the European Parliament and its committees, in particular, the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. [ 6 ] The independent nature of the EDPB is addressed further in the commentary on Article 69 GDPR. The second paragraph of Article 68 establishes that the Board will be represented by a Chair. The Chair fulfils both a public and formal role. The former consists of representing the Board and its supervisory authorities at conferences, press meetings and so forth. The latter establishes the Chair as the Board's formal legal representative whose responsibilities include authorising decisions of the Board and representing the Board before the European Courts. [ 7 ] The Chair's formal capacity acts in stark contrast to the WP29, which acted only in a public capacity. Articles 73 and 74 GDPR further outline the appointment and tasks of the Chair. The WP29 was comprised of members from national supervisory authorities. However, Article 68(3) GDPR requires the Board to be composed of the heads of the national supervisory authorities. As noted by Docksey, this prerequisite \u201c emphasizes that the Board is intended to be a high-level body \u201d and \u201c significantly increases the \u2018self-binding\u2019 effect on national authorities of discussions and decisions by their heads at the Board .\u201d [ 8 ] Beyond necessitating that only the heads of national supervisory authorities may act as Board members, the GDPR does not establish further eligibility criteria for Board members. Nonetheless, the GDPR does lay down criteria regulating the eligibility of supervisory authority members in Article 53 GDPR. [ 9 ] While not explicitly stated, it can be inferred from Article 68(5) GDPR that all Board members have the right to vote. Article 68(5) GDPR outlines that the Commission shall participate in the Board\u2019s activities and meetings, without voting rights, suggesting that Board members in contrast, do have voting rights. [ 10 ] The supervisory authorities heads of EEA/EFTA States are members of the EDPB, but are resticted in their functions. They generally have the same obligations to the Board as the supervisory authorities of Member States, but notably, do not hold voting rights and may not stand for election as deputy chairs. [ 11 ] The fourth paragraph of Article 68 GDPR provides that where a Member State has multiple supervisory authorities, a joint representative, appointed in accordance with that Member State\u2019s law, must act as representative to the Board. [ 12 ] While the Commission may participate in the EDPB\u2019s meetings and activities, it is not a member and does not enjoy voting rights. Docksey notes that this right to participation is somewhat \u201c remarkable ,\u201d and undermines the EDPB\u2019s independent nature. [ 13 ] This point is discussed further in the commentary on Article 69 GDPR. The European Data Protection Supervisor ('EDPS') holds limited voting rights in the Board on issues of dispute resolution pursuant to Article 65 GDPR. These issues concern the principles and rules applicable to the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies established under Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. This arrangement acts as a compromise between two opposing understandings of the EDPS' function. The first notes that the EDPS should not be entitled to vote on decisions that are not of its concern, and the second understanding, which argues that the EDPS should be treated the same as any other supervisory authority. [ 14 ] Arguably, in practice the outcome of any such debate makes little difference, given that the principles and rules under Regulation 2018/1725 materially correspond to those of the GDPR. Thus, regarless the EDPS is likely to be eligible to vote in many cases. [ 15 ] \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 68 GDPR \u2191 Schiedermair , in Spiecker gen.

act independently 3.2 (2) The Board shall neither seek nor take instructions from any body 3.1 (1) The Board shall act independently 3.2 (2) The Board shall neither seek nor take instructions from any body 4 Decisions 5 References 1.   The Board shall act independently when performing its tasks or exercising its powers pursuant to Articles 70 and 71. 2.   Without prejudice to requests by the Commission referred to in point (b) of Article 70(1) and in Article 70(2), the Board shall, in the performance of its tasks or the exercise of its powers, neither seek nor take instructions from anybody. Article 69 GDPR seeks to guarantee the Board's independence in its functioning as a Union Body. In practice, this provision establishes that other Union bodies may not interfere in the EDPB's functioning. This arrangement stands in stark contrast to that of the Board's predecessor, the Article 29 Working Party (\u201c WP29 \u201d), in which the Commission held voting rights. [ 1 ] The establishment of the Board as a free-standing body goes beyond simply a normative assertion of independence. The wording of the Article provides that the Board shall \"act independently, \" indicating that the EDPB must act autonomously in relation to the fulfilment of its functions. [ 2 ] Importantly, the Board's independence does not exclude its actions from the scrutiny of other Union bodies, [ 3 ] it still remains accountable to them. [ 4 ] Nonetheless, the scrutiny of any such external bodies may only come following an action taken by the Board, they may not interfere in the performance of the Board's tasks and exercise of its powers. The right to supervision by an independent authority is laid down in Article 8(3) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (\" CFR \"), Article 16(2)  Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\" TFEU \"), and Article 39 Treaty on the European Union (\" TEU \"). The CJEU has also defined this right as an \u201c essential component \u201d of the fundamental right to data protection. [ 5 ] However, the wording of Article 69 GDPR may suggest that it takes a less stringent position regarding the EDPB\u2019s independence in comparison with that of national supervisory authorities. Under Article 52(2) GDPR national supervisory authorities must \u201c act with complete independence, \u201d while Article 69 simply provides that the Board shall \"act independently .\" The disparity in the wording of these two Articles indicates that the independence of the EDPB is not absolute. For instance, the Board relies on the European Data Protection Supervisor ( \"EDPS\" ) for facilities, staff, and budget, and pursuant to Article 68(6) GDPR, the EDPS holds limited voting rights in the Board on issues of dispute resolution. This reading is supported by the Court in Commission v Germany , which interpreted the phrase \u201c complete independence \u201d in the context of Directive 95/46/EC. Here, the Court emphasised that the use of the \u201c adjective \u2018complete\u2019 [...] implies a decision-making power independent of any direct or indirect external influence on the supervisory authority. \u201d [ 6 ] On the other hand, some commentators contend that this linguistic difference is immaterial. [ 7 ] In particular, the word \u201c complete \u201d is omitted where primary law refers to independent supervisory authorities, yet in practice this omission does not affect their level of independence. The second paragraph of Article 69 lays down the manner in which the Board exercises its independence, providing that the Board shall not seek nor take instructions from any body in the fulfilment of its duties. While the Board is not permitted to seek instructions from or depend on external bodies, this requirement does not exclude the Board from consulting external experts where needed. However, any such consultation must be made transparent within the framework of Article 76 GDPR regulating confidentiality. [ 8 ] Notably thought, Article 69(2) GDPR establishes that this requirement is without prejudice to instances where the Commission seeks advice from the Board on issues related to the protection of personal data in the Union, including advice regarding proposed amendments to the GDPR (pursuant to Article\u00a070(1)(b)\u00a0GDPR). Although not explicitly mentioned in Article 69(2) GDPR, the requirement that the Board shall not seek nor take instructions from any body also applies without prejudice to situations where the Commission requests an opinion from the EDPB on instances outlined by Article 64(2) GDPR. These instances concern matters \u201c of general application \u201d or which \u201c produc[e] effects in more than one member state, in particular where a competent supervisory authority does not comply with the obligations for mutual assistance in accordance with Article 61 or for joint operations in accordance with Article 62 \u201d (Article 64(2) GDPR). [ 9 ] Commentators note that such requests for advice and opinions, which the EDPB cannot refuse, may impede the performance of its tasks where they fall outwith the scope delimitated by Article 64(2). Nevertheless, the Board is not obliged to address these requests within a particular time frame or hierarchical order. [ 10 ] Article 68(5) GDPR and Recital 139 provide that while the Commission does not enjoy voting rights, it may participate in EDPB activities and meetings. It has been argued that \u201c in view of the high standard of independence required under Article 8(3) of the Charter, care must be taken \u201d here, particularly regarding meetings concerning cases \u201c where the Commission has a specific interest in the executive of the European Union .\u201d [ 11 ] \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 69 GDPR \u2191 Dix in K\u00fchling, Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 69 GDPR, margin numbers 1-3 (C.H.

Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies: Point (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of their tasks. 2.   Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation with regard to processing for compliance with points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 by determining more precisely specific requirements for the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including for other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX. 3.   The basis for the processing referred to in point (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 shall be laid down by: The purpose of the processing shall be determined in that legal basis or, as regards the processing referred to in point (e) of paragraph 1, shall be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. That legal basis may contain specific provisions to adapt the application of rules of this Regulation, inter alia: the general conditions governing the lawfulness of processing by the controller; the types of data which are subject to the processing; the data subjects concerned; the entities to, and the purposes for which, the personal data may be disclosed; the purpose limitation; storage periods; and processing operations and processing procedures, including measures to ensure lawful and fair processing such as those for other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX. The Union or the Member State law shall meet an objective of public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. 4.   Where the processing for a purpose other than that for which the personal data have been collected is not based on the data subject's consent or on a Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard the objectives referred to in Article 23(1) , the controller shall, in order to ascertain whether processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, take into account, inter alia: Paragraph 1 of Article 6 GDPR is based on Article 7 of the previous Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC . As a general rule, personal data may not be processed without complying with on of six exceptions (\"legal basis\"). Paragraphs 2 and 3 deal with the options for Member States to implement laws that make processing under 6(1)(c) and (e) necessary. Paragraph 4 is actually linked to the \"purpose limitation\" principle in Article 5(1)(b) GDPR and further expands on what a \"compatible purpose\" is. EDPB Guidelines : On this Article, please see EDPB 'Guidelines 05/2020 on consent under Regulation 2016/679', 4 May 2020 (Version 1.1); EDPB, 'Opinion 08/2024 on Valid Consent in the Context of Consent or Pay Models Implemented by Large Online Platforms', 17 April 2024 ; EDPB, 'Guidelines 2/2019 on the processing of personal data under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of the provision of online services to data subjects', 8 October 2019 (Version 2.0); EDPB, 'Guidelines 8/2020 on the targeting of social media users', 13 April 2021 (Version 2.0); EDPB, 'Guidelines 1/2024 on processing of personal data based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR', 8 October 2024 (Version 1.0). Article 6(1) GDPR generally prohibits the processing of personal data unless at least one of the six legal bases listed under points (a) to (f) is fulfilled. This provision states that \u201c [p]rocessing shall be lawful only if \u201d one of these conditions applies, effectively setting a default position against unauthorized data processing. This general prohibition flows from the fact that under Article 8(2) CFR, the right to data protection is recognized as a fundamental right (\" data must be processed ... on the basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law \"). Therefore, the requirement to have a legal basis for processing personal data must be interpreted in light of the Charter and the principle of proportionality outlined in Article 52(1) CFR. The system established by Article 6(1) GDPR\u2014as a general prohibition unless there is a justification\u2014has been criticized in some Member States for being overly restrictive. However, this approach is not unusual when dealing with fundamental rights. Just like other fundamental rights\u2014such as the right to property, freedom of expression, or the right to physical integrity\u2014the default position is that others may not interfere with a data subject\u2019s right to data protection unless there is a justified legal basis. It is therefore important that the requirement to have a legal basis is interpreted in the light of the Charter and the principle of proportionality in Article 52(1) CFR. The system of Article 6(1) as a general prohibition, unless there is a justification is criticized in some Member States, [ 1 ] but not unusual for a fundamental right. Just like other fundamental rights (e.g. the right to property, freedom of expression or the right to physical integrity), the default position is, that others may not interfere with a data subject's right to data protection, unless there is a justification. \"[...] the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR sets out an exhaustive and restrictive list of the cases in which processing of personal data can be regarded as lawful. Thus, in order to be capable of being regarded as such, processing must fall within one of the cases provided for in that provision [...]\". CJEU - C\u2011621/22 - Koninklijke Nederlandse Lawn Tennisbond , margin number 29. See also: CJEU - C-252/21 - Meta Platforms and Others (General terms of use of a social network) , margin number 90; CJEU - C-439/19 - Latvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty points) , margin number 99; CJEU - C\u2011708/18 - Asocia\u0163ia de Proprietari bloc M5A-ScaraA , margin number 37 and 38; CJEU - C-582/14 - Breyer margin number 57; CJEU - C-468/10 and C-469/10 - ASNEF and FECEMD (Joined Cases) , margin numbers 36. Given that this is the type of legal basis that the average data subject is confronted with the most consent is usually seen as more prominent than the other five legal basis. In fact, there is no hierarchy between the various legal basis. It is a matter controllers to choose the legal basis they wish to rely on. Each legal basis has specific features, upsides and downsides from the perspective of controllers and data subjects. While at least one legal basis has to be fulfilled, it is possible that there are multiple legal basis that a controller can rely at the same time (\" at least one \") . However, as long as one of the legal bases in Article 6(1) GDPR applies, it is not necessary to determine whether that processing also falls within the scope of another legal basis. [ 2 ] Using multiple legal basis may however raise transparency issues under Article 5(1)(a), if a data subject for example thinks that personal data is processed solely based on consent (which can be withdrawn at any time), while in fact the controller also relies on another legal basis like a legal obligation (which does not allow for a withdrawal by the data subject). The data subjects would then be tricked into thinking that they have more agency than they really have. [ 3 ] The concept of \"necessity\" is used five of the six legal basis (Article 6(1)(b) to (f) GDPR). Only consent does not contain the requirement, as consent must be \"specific\" anyways. The concept of \"necessity\" must be interpreted as in the light of applicable European law and is also known under Article 52(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Therefore, its interpretation must fully reflect the objectives of data protection law. [ 4 ] \"Assessing what is \u2018necessary\u2019 involves ascertaining whether in practice the legitimate data processing interests pursued cannot reasonably be achieved just as effectively by other means less restrictive of the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects. If there are reasonable, just as effective, but less intrusive alternatives, the processing may not be considered to be \u2018necessary\u2019. In this context, the CJEU expressly recalled that the condition relating to the need for processing must be examined in conjunction with the \u2018data minimisation\u2019 principle enshrined in Article 5(1)(c) GDPR, in accordance with which personal data must be \u2018adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed\u2019. The Court also emphasised that a processing should be carried out \u2018only in so far as is strictly necessary\u2019 for the purposes of the legitimate interest identified. This requirement of strict necessity is also emphasised, for instance, in Recital 47 GDPR, which states that \u2018[t]he processing of personal data strictly necessary for the purposes of preventing fraud [\u2026] constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned.\u2019\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 1/2024 on processing of personal data based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR', 8 October 2024 (Version 1), margin number 29 Footnotes (including references to the CJEU case law) were omitted in this quote. The CJEU generally follows a concept of strict necessity and a narrow interpretation. In C\u2011524/06 - Huber on a German central register to manage matters in relation to foreign nationals the CJEU held that the \u201c concept [of necessity] ...has its own independent meaning in Community law and ... must be interpreted in a manner which fully reflects the objective of [Directive 95/46/EC]\u201d. [ 5 ] The CJEU held that such a register must not contain any information other than what is necessary for the purpose of implementing specific laws on foreign nationals. From a systematic point of view any legal basis under Article 6(1) GDPR constitutes an exemption to the general prohibition of data processing. As such, the exemption itself and all the wording it carries, including the \"necessity\" requirement, must be interpreted narrowly. Regarding the use of personal data after a traffic accident the CJEU held: \"As regards the condition relating to the necessity of processing personal data, it should be borne in mind that derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary [...]\" CJEU - C-13/16 - R\u012bgas satiksme , margin number 30.. Regarding an European law requiring the publication of recipients of agricultural subsidies the CJEU held that: \"[...] limitations in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary [...]\" CJEU - Joined Cases C-92/09 and C-93/09 - Volker and Markus , margin number 86.. Regarding the handling of personal data in documents published in commercial registers, the CJEU elaborated: \"That requirement of necessity is not met where the objective of general interest pursued can reasonably be achieved just as effectively by other means less restrictive of the fundamental rights of data subjects, in particular the rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data guaranteed in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter, since derogations and limitations in relation to the principle of protection of such data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary [...]\" CJEU - C-200/23 - Agentsia po vpisvaniyata , margin number 111.. Regarding a sports federation's disclosure of its members personal data to third parties, namely, in this case, a company that sells sports products and a provider of casino games, for advertising or marketing purposes, in particular so that that company and provider may send advertising messages and special offers to those members,  the CJEU held: \"[...] as regards the condition that such processing be necessary for the purposes of that interest and, in particular, the existence of means that are less restrictive of the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects and equally appropriate, it must be stated that it would, in particular, be possible for a sports federation [...], wishing to disclose its members\u2019 personal data to third parties for consideration, to inform its members beforehand and to ask them whether they want their data to be transmitted to those third parties for advertising or marketing purposes. [...] That solution would make it possible for the members concerned, in accordance with the data minimisation principle referred to in paragraph 43 of the present judgment, to retain control over the disclosure of their personal data and thus to limit the disclosure of those data to what is in fact necessary and relevant in relation to the purposes for which those data are transmitted and processed [...]\". CJEU - C\u2011621/22 - Koninklijke Nederlandse Lawn Tennisbond , margin number 51 et seq.. Despite the narrow interpretation of strict necessity, a controller is not prohibited from using personal data, just because there is a theoretical alternative that does not include the use of personal data, only realistic alternative must be considered. Processing that is \"useful\" but not objectively \"necessary\" is not covered and hence not allowed. [ 6 ] For example EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) have clarified that assessing what is \"necessary\" involves a factual analysis of the processing operations and their purpose(s) and whether less intrusive alternatives that achieve the same goal exist. If there are realistic, less intrusive processing operations, then the other more intrusive ones must be excluded \u2013 i.e. they are not \"necessary\" under EU law. [ 7 ] \"Article 6(1)(b) will not cover processing which is useful but not objectively necessary for performing the contractual service  or for taking relevant pre-contractual steps at the request of the data subject, even if it is necessary for the controller\u2019s other business purposes.\" Guidelines 2/2019 on the processing of personal data under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of the provision of online services to data subjects', 8 October 2019 (Version 2.0), margin number 25. Common mistake: During the assessment whether a processing activity is really necessary, one should not make the mistake to rely on common practices and social conventions. These should not to be take into account for this consideration. [ 8 ] The option to give consent is explicitly named as a fundamental right in Article 8(2) CFR. It is therefore important that it is interpreted in the light of the Charter and the principle of proportionality in Article 52(1) CFR. Like other rights, the right to data protection can be waived by the data subject, by providing consent to the processing of their personal data. Given that data subjects are usually the weaker party in any transaction, [ 9 ] the GDPR foresees a number of conditions that controllers have to comply with to obtain valid consent. This approach is very similar to other protections when fundamental rights are waived (e.g. gifting real estate may need the involvement of a notary, surgeries require detailed information and consent under Article 3(2) of the Charter). Compared to the waiver of other fundamental rights, consenting to data procession is has however become rather ubiquitous. Consent is the most prominent legal basis, as it is the only one that data subjects are regularly confronted with. However, it is not the prime or even the most desirable legal basis. Typically consent is the \"last option\", as Article 6(1)(b) to (e) GDPR provide for a legal basis for most daily processing operations, without the need to seek consent. For example: Josephine is the new data protection officer for an online shop. She realizes that the check-out page requires consent under Article 6(1)(a) to the processing of personal data for processing the payment and for delivering the products. As this is already covered by \"necessary for the performance of a contract\" under Article 6(1)(b), she removes this consent clause. This is not just more transparent for data subjects, as they are not tricked to believe that they can withdraw the consent, but it also makes the online form quicker to click through. Consent is regularly criticized in the legal literature and by the public. Criticism seems to be largely fed by bad consent practices , but not necessarily by shortcomings of the letter of the law. If the conditions for consent are properly applied, it allows data subjects to exercise their right to informational self-determination. While it is correct that data subjects can be overwhelmed with these decisions, a liberal legal order requires that data subjects have agency over their rights, which includes waiving them. Given that Article 8(2) of the Charta explicitly foresees consent as one of the legal bases for data processing, consent is here to stay. The EDPB provides highly relevant information in connection with the consent: Guidelines 5/2020 on consent under the GDPR . But also other, less specific guidelines and opinions by the EDPB touch the topic of consent and are therefore also quite relevant: see, inter alia, Guidelines 03/2022 on deceptive design patterns in social media platform interfaces: how to recognise and avoid them and Opinion 08/2024 on Valid Consent in the Context of Consent or Pay Models Implemented by Large Online Platforms . To ensure that consent is not only a legal fiction (\"click fatigue\"), the GDPR introduces a number of conditions that are meant to ensure that data subjects have a genuine choice when it comes to the processing of their data. Unfortunately the relevant elements are spread over different Articles of the GDPR: According to the available definition provided in Article 4(11) GDPR , consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. Furthermore, under Article 7 GDPR , a controller must be able to demonstrate that consent was given, consent must be distinguishable from other matters in any written declaration, can be withdrawn at any time and the provision of a contract may not be made conditional on consent. Finally, Article 8 GDPR stipulates that specific requirements must be respected when consent is given by children. Consequently, the conditions for valid consent are split between Articles 4(11) , 6(1)(a), 7 and 8 GDPR and require a joint reading of the different articles. See the commentary on Articles 7 and 8 GDPR for further details. There is a slightly different concept of \" explicit consent \" in Articles 9(1)(a) , 22(2)(c) and 49(1)(a) GDPR. See the commentary on Article 9(1)(a) GDPR for explicit consent. Generally, consent must be given directly by the data subject or a nominated representative. [ 10 ] National law determines if a data subject lacks the legal capacity to make legally binding declarations, including declarations under the GDPR. In the case of minors acting in the context of an \"information society service\", Article 8(1) GDPR provides a minimum age of 16 year. Member States may reduce that age limit - but not below 13 year. There is currently no rule in the GDPR about the age for consent outside of \"information society services\". This means there is also no rules in the GDPR for the age of consent in any offline context. Consent has to be freely given, which means that the data subjects must have the option to freely and genuinely choose to say \"yes\" to the processing of their personal data. Just like other legally relevant declaration, consent is void if the data subject was for example physically forced to consent. However, the notion of \"freely given\" is much broader under Article 6(1)(4) GDPR, as illustrated by the rules in Articles 4(11) , 7 or 8 GDPR, as well as Recital 43. If consent is \"freely given\" under the GDPR requires a holistic and also economic analysis of the options for a data subject. The wholistic approach should lead to better results than previous approaches, but also uses vaguer concepts. Whether the option to refuse is genuinely given depends on the processing operation and service as well as the respective roles of the controller and the data subject in a given transaction. Not every abstract power imbalance makes consent invalid, however typical examples can be derived: Relationships with public authorities [ 11 ] Employer-employee-relationships [ 12 ] Use of major digital services with limited alternatives [ 13 ] , for example because of a \"network effect\". [ 14 ] In other words, employers, governments or companies (especially those with a dominant market position) will typically be able to force data subjects to consent against their true wishes. In this perspective, Recital 43 GDPR highlights that if there is a \" clear imbalance between the data subject and the controller \" consent should not be considered a valid legal basis for the processing. [ 15 ] For example: A sales representative has to \"consent\" that his mobile phone is tracked to ensure that he does not cheat on his time sheet and does not use the company car for private trips. Obviously the employee will be able to challenge the consent, if he only agreed to keep his job. Recital 43 and Article 7(4) GDPR further deal with the situation of \"bundled consent\", i.e. when the performance of a contract is made conditional on consent. While such bundled consent is not automatically void, the law requires that \" utmost account shall be taken \" if the provision of a contract is made conditional on consent. For example: An app that costs \u20ac 1,99 per month requires that any new users agree to the terms and conditions when singing up. On the next screen the users must also consent to the sharing of their personal data with third parties for advertisement reasons. The use of personal data is not necessary for using the app. Necessary processing to use the core functions of the app can however be based on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. For further indications on the issue of bundled consent and the criteria to assess the freely given requirement, see Article 7(4) GDPR . Consent must be informed. This is especially challenging in highly complex technological environments. As controller may have the technical, practical and legal knowledge to understand the relevant processing information and take months or years to develop this understanding, while an average data subject may not have any relevant education or knowledge but most make a choice within seconds or at best minutes. Under the GDPR, the controller must overcome this information asymmetry to get valid consent. Beyond the specific purpose, Articles 4(11) and 6(1)(a) GDPR do not specify which exact information must be provided to the data subject when asking for consent. Article 7(3) GDPR requires to inform the data subject about their right to withdraw consent prior to giving consent. Recital 42 adds the identity of the controller, but also clarifies that this is a minimum standard: \" For consent to be informed, the data subject should be aware at least of the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended .\" Further information may depend on the specific purpose and processing operations that consent is sought for. Articles 13 and 14 GDPR can be seen as instructive, insofar as relevant for the processing operation. When personal data is shared, it may be necessary to inform about the individual recipients. [ 16 ] Overall data subjects must be able to understand the circumstances of the processing of their personal data to estimate the consequences and implications of giving their consent. [ 17 ] Consent should be sought using clear and plain language and be provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form. [ 18 ] Especially euphemisms and wording that is more inspired by marketing than the facts is not clear. Equally, overly legal and technical descriptions are not clear and plain either. Under Article 7(2) GDPR information to the data subject in the moment of consent under Article 6(1)(a) must be distinguished from any other matter. Just adding a link to the very broad information that needs to be provided under Articles 13 and 14 GDPR is therefore not leading to valid consent. Simply linking to a lengthy privacy policy is also not making information \" easily accessible \", as data subjects will hardly find the relevant information needed to make a decision on the specific processing that is based on consent. Common mistake: A mere confirmation that users \"agree to the privacy policy\" is in most cases not easily accessible, if the privacy policy usually concerns a lot of additional information and is not limited to only processing under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. If the privacy policy also concerns multiple processing operations such cases consent is also not \"specific\" (see below). Overall the controller has the (sometimes difficult) task to explain the use of personal data in a short, clear and plain way, without using overly technical or legal jargon, so that an average data subjects have a clear understanding of what they should consent to. In accordance with the principle of transparency from Article 5(1)(b) GDPR consent must be provided for specific and legitimate purposes. When the processing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of them separately. [ 19 ] A blanket consent to all kinds of purposes is therefore not valid. For example, \" I agree to the processing of my data for advertisement, product improvement and the sharing with business partners \" is not specific and therefore invalid. For example: An online shop has a checkout page, where users must \"consent to the use of your data for marketing, the transfer to non-EU providers and the sharing of data with partners\". Any consent to these three purposes, would usually fail the \"specific\" element required for consent. Equally, just naming \"partners\" is likely not specific enough if there are specific known recipients. The principle of specificity of consent in Article 4(11) GDPR is confirmed by Article 6(1)(a) which requires consent to be given for \u201c for one or more specific purposes\u201d. This seems in line with the case law of the Court of Justice of the EU, according to which consent must refer to specific processing activities, clearly identified, [ 20 ] also in order to allow the user to effectively understand the operations being carried out. [ 21 ] Consent must be given unambiguously in the form of clear and affirmative action, however no specific form is required. Consent must be an unambiguous act, including any oral, written or other form of signifying the agreement to have personal data processed. [ 22 ] In a digital environment consent is typically given by checking a box (\"opt-in\"), choosing technical settings that indicate the data subject\u2019s acceptance of the proposed processing or clicking a button. [ 23 ] For example: At a wedding, the photographer asks a group to stand underneath the tree if they want to be on the picture, which will go to the couple\"s wedding website. Marcel and Alex make their way underneath the tree and waive at the camera. They have given unambiguous consent. Conversely, silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not constitute consent. [ 24 ] This has been stressed through recent case law by the CJEU where a pre-checked checkbox which the user had to deselect in order to refuse their consent cannot show any active behaviour. [ 25 ] Similarly, actions which are not clearly affirmative include the simple use of a webpage. A user may simply ignore that a webpage uses data in a certain way. This ambiguity extends to assigning certain actions a legal meaning through a disclaimer (e.g. \" by using our webpage you agree to X \"). Accordingly, it is in practice impossible to ascertain whether a user had actually given their consent by not deselecting the pre-ticked checkbox or had just not noticed the information provided. [ 26 ] \"[T]he data subject\u2019s consent may make such processing lawful provided that the data subject has given his or her consent \u2018unambiguously\u2019. Only active behaviour on the part of the data subject with a view to giving his or her consent may fulfil that requirement. [\u2026] In that regard, it would appear impossible in practice to ascertain objectively whether a website user had actually given his or her consent to the processing of his or her personal data by not deselecting a pre-ticked checkbox nor, in any event, whether that consent had been informed. It is not inconceivable that a user would not have read the information accompanying the preselected checkbox, or even would not have noticed that checkbox, before continuing with his or her activity on the website visited.\" CJEU - C-673/17 - Planet49 , margin number 54 et seq. Consent can be withdrawn at any time. Withdrawing of consent shall be as easy as it was giving it. The controller has to inform the data subject on the possibility to withdraw consent prior to the processing. For further information, see the commentary on Article 7(3) GDPR . For example: An fitness app allows customers to opt-in to share their sports data online with a simple button. To stop the online sharing, the app requires sending an email to the app provider, including the app ID and a verification that the sender is actually the data subject. Article 7(1) GDPR further requires that a controller can demonstrate that the data subject has given consent. This goes beyond the mere burden of proof under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR and Article 5(2) GDPR and requires appropriate documentation or other options to demonstrate consent, like documentation that technical measures were in place, requiring clicking a check-box before proceeding. \"For instance, the controller may keep a record of consent statements received, so he can show how consent was obtained, when consent was obtained and the information provided to the data subject at the time shall be demonstrable. The controller shall also be able to show that the data subject was informed and the controller\u00b4s workflow met all relevant criteria for a valid consent. The rationale behind this obligation in the GDPR is that controllers must be accountable with regard to obtaining valid consent from data subjects and the consent mechanisms they have put in place. For example, in an online context, a controller could retain information on the session in which consent was expressed, together with documentation of the consent workflow at the time of the session, and a copy of the information that was presented to the data subject at that time. It would not be sufficient to merely refer to a correct configuration of the respective website.\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 05/2020 on consent under Regulation 2016/679', 4 May 2020 (Version 1.1), margin number 108. Most daily business requires rather simple and foreseeable processing of personal data. To ensure that these standard processing operations are not limited and do not need the data subject\"s consent, Article 6(1)(b) GDPR legalizes these processing operations by law. For example: A data subject buys a product in an online shop. To perform this contract the controller may need to process the data subject\"s credit card details. The details may be transferred to financial institutions for payment purposes. The buyer\u2019s name and physical address can be shared with the shipment service for product delivery. While contract and consent must be clearly separated, Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is usually also based on a (civil law) agreement of the data subject and therefore related to the notion of informational self-determination. [ 27 ] The EDPB has issued Guidelines 2/2019 on the processing of personal data under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR with a detailed analysis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. General information on necessity can be found above under the overview on Article 6(1) under \"necessity\". The concept of necessity means that processing must be limited to what is strictly necessary.  The processing of personal data ist necessary for the performance of a contract if it is objectively indispensable for a purpose that is integral to the contractual obligation intended for the data subject. A controller must therefore be able to demonstrate that the main subject matter of a contract cannot be achieved if the processing does not occur. Otherwise the controller can not invoke Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis. [ 28 ] For example: A gym that is requesting core information from customers (e.g. name, address). It is reasonable that the use of this data is \"necessary\" for the performance of the contract with its customers. However, the use of entry and exit data to measure the use of the gym is only \"necessary\" under the contract if the gym is paid per entry, not per month. There may be other legal basis to process such data, but it is not \"necessary\" under the contract. Usually most the terms of a contract are imposed by the controller, not the data subject. If a controller could arbitrarily add elements to the scope of its contracts as to make any processing activity \"necessary\", then the reference to \"necessity\" itself would become useless (and contracts would become, indeed, a tool to bypass e.g the requirement to ask for valid consent under Article 6(1)(a) for any where there is no other legal basis. In it\"s Binding Decision 3/2021 on Meta (Facebook) the EDPB held that adding elements in terms and conditions that are aimed at making behavioural advertisement do not make the \"necessary\" under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, as the core contract has to be determined not by artificially added elements, but by the expectations of data subject. In the case of Facebook, data subjects mainly see this as a communication tool. \"[R]egard should be given to the particular aim, purpose, or objective of the service and, for applicability of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, it is required that the processing is objectively necessary for a purpose and integral to the delivery of that contractual service to the data subject. [\u2026] Moreover, the EDPB notes that the controller should be able to justify the necessity of its processing by reference to the fundamental and mutually understood contractual purpose. This depends not only on the controller\u2019s perspective, but also on a reasonable data subject\u2019s perspective when entering into the contract. [\u2026] The fact that the [controller\u2019s] Terms of Service do not provide for any contractual obligation binding [the controller] to offer personalised advertising to the [controller\u2019s] users and any contractual penalty if [the controller] fails to do so shows that, at least from the perspective of the [controller\u2019s] user, this processing is not necessary to perform the contract. Providing personalised advertising to its users may be an obligation between [the controller] and the specific advertisers that pay for [the controller\u2019s] targeted display of their advertisements in the [controller\u2019s] service to [the controller\u2019s] users, but it is not presented as an obligation towards the [controller\u2019s] users.\" EDPB, 'Adopted Binding Decision 3/2022 on the dispute submitted by the Irish SA on Meta Platforms Ireland Limited and its Facebook service (Art. 65 GDPR)', 5 December 2022, margin numbers 112, 113 and 118. In practice, the assessment should be driven by questions such as: what is the nature of the service being provided to the data subject? What are its distinguishing characteristics in the view of an average data subject? What is the exact rationale of the contract (i.e. its substance and fundamental object) and essential elements? What are the mutual perspectives and expectations of the parties to the contract? How is the service promoted or advertised to the data subject? Would an ordinary user of the service reasonably expect that, considering the nature of the service, the envisaged processing will take place in order to perform the contract to which they are a party? [ 29 ] Common mistake: Just because processing is related to a contract, or merely useful for the performance of a contract, does not mean that it is strictly necessary for the performance of a contract. A question that regularly came up in connection with the processing of personal data for the performance of a contractual is, whether it could be considered necessary to use personal data  (specifically, data subjects' titles and gender identities) in order to personalise commercial communication with customers (e.g. addressing them as Mr. or Ms.). However, the CJEU rejected the necessity for this purpose: \"[C]ommercial communication may constitute a purpose forming an integral part of the contractual service concerned, since the provision of such a rail transport service involves, in principle, communicating with the customer in order, inter alia, to send him or her a travel document by electronic means, to inform him or her of any changes affecting the corresponding journey, and to allow exchanges with the after-sales service. That communication may require adherence to accepted practices and may include, in particular, forms of addressing a customer, in order to show that the undertaking concerned respects its customer and thereby to safeguard that undertaking\u2019s brand image. However, it appears that such communication does not necessarily have to be personalised based on the gender identity of the customer concerned. According to the case-law, personalised content does not appear to be necessary in order to offer services to a customer where those services may, where appropriate, be provided to him or her in the form of an equivalent alternative which does not involve such a personalisation, such that the latter is not objectively indispensable for a purpose that is integral to those services [\u2026].\" CJEU - C-394/23 Mousse , margin number 37 et seq. Of course this does not exclude the possibility that the processing of customer's title or gender identity is necessary for the performance of a contract for other reasons. E.g. if a transport undertaking offers carriages in night reserved for people with the same gender identity. [ 30 ] Another case in which the legal basis of contractually necessity is regularly incorrectly invoked as a legal basis is the mandatory creation on an user-account by the provider of a e-commerce website for - even for a one-time sale. According to the EDPB, the fact that so called guest-purchases without an account are a common practice shows, that the necessity test is unlikely to be met in this case and that the website provider cannot invoke Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis for the processing involved in the creating and maintaining the user account. [ 31 ] However, according to the EDPB, the mandatory creation of a user account could be based on this legal basis in case of a subscription service which establishes a long-term contractual relationship between the controller and the data subject which requires (e.g. the frequent identification of the data subject in order to access the content of the subscribed service). [ 32 ] A contract under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR must be valid. [ 33 ] Void contracts cannot serve as a legal basis under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. [ 34 ] It is a matter of applicable contract law if a specific contract or clause is valid. While some contractual elements are regulated on a European level (for example the minimum requirements under the Unfair Terms Directive 93/13/EEC for terms and conditions), civil law is generally a matter of each Member State. Especially in the consumer context, a contract may be subject to the laws of the Member State where each consumer resides (see e.g. Articles 17 to 19 of the Brussles-Ia Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 ). For example: A Spanish controller and a French consumer concluded a contract that would be valid in Spain, but is void under the applicable French law. The lack of any valid contract means there is also no legal basis under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. However, certain contractual defects seem to be common to many European legal traditions: for example, intention, misrepresentation and duress. However, beyond such standard cases there are circumstances in which a breach does not necessarily lead to a contract being void, but only allows contract partners to successfully challenge the contract. The EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 have clarified that these rules must be taken into account in assessing the validity of a national contract: \u201c contracts and contractual terms must comply with [\u2026] consumer protection laws in order for processing based on those terms to be considered fair and lawful \u201d. [ 35 ] In conclusion, in order to understand whether a contract is valid or not, a controller must first identify the applicable law and, second, verify whether the contract is valid under that law (including any applicable EU law). Under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, data processing may also be lawful in pre-contractual situations at the request of the data subject. For example: A data subject asks a sales representative for curtains to send information on their products and to schedule an appointment at the data subject\"s house. The parties have not (yet) formed a contract, but the sales representative may use the data subject\"s details to the extent that this is necessary for the pre-contractual steps. \"[W]here a data subject contacts the controller to enquire about the details of the controller\u2019s service offerings, the processing of the data subject\u2019s personal data for the purpose of responding to the enquiry can be based on Article 6(1)(b). [...] [T]his provision would not cover unsolicited marketing or other processing which is carried out solely on the initiative of the data controller, or at the request of a third party.\" EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 2/2019 on the processing of personal data under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of the provision of online services to data subjects\u2019, 8 October 2019 (Version 2.0), margin number 46 et seq. Where the processing is based on the performance of a contract, the end of such a contract (e.g. in the case of fulfillment or termination) makes this legal basis vanish, the processing of personal data under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is no longer allowed. As the controller typically still needs to process personal data after a contract is fulfilled or terminated, the same data can be still be processed for other legal purposes. For example: Already the privacy policy of the controller included that the relevant personal data is not only processed for the performance of the contract, but also compliance with a legal obligations under Article 6(1)(c) GDPR (e.g. tax records) and the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (e.g. to manage guarantee claims and alike). You can find more information on such other legal basis in the commentary on Article 6(1)(c) to (f) below. EDPB Guidelines: On this provision there are the EDPB Guidelines  06/2020 on the interplay of the Second Payment Services Directive and the GDPR ; and EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on the processing of personal data under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of the provision of online services to data subjects The GDPR recognises that under many European and Member State\"s laws controllers may be obliged to collect, store, and otherwise process personal information. Under Article 6(1)(c), such processing operations are considered lawful if they are necessary to fulfil these obligations. For example: An employer processes personal data for social insurance purposes or under a duty to document compliance with workers' rights. A bank keeps records and shares them with authorities under money laundering legislation. A company keeps all relevant financial information under a duty to keep documentation on paid taxes for a certain number of years. Information on necessity can be found above under the overview on Article 6(1) under \"necessity\". The concept of necessity means that processing must be limited to what is strictly necessary. This does not mean that only indispensable processing is allowed. Unreasonable alternatives are not taken into account, but merely \"useful\" additional processing is not \"necessary\" The legal obligation must originate directly from the law. \u2018Member State law\u2019 refers to all material law of that Member State. [ 36 ] It may not result from a contractual arrangement, [ 37 ] non-binding government requests or any form of \"guidelines\" or \"best practice documents\" and like that do not have the force of law. It is a matter of the national constitutional law to determine what constitutes obligations with the force of law. In some Member States this may include secondary legislation (e.g. \"statutory instruments\" or ministerial \"directives\"), local laws or ordinances, all the way to collective bargaining agreements that are given the force of law in some Member States. [ 38 ] For example: A controller gets a request from the police to disclose certain information. The police says it has a right to get that information. Once the controller takes a closer look, it turns out that under applicable national law, the police may ask the controller for such information and hope for their voluntary support, but the controller has no obligation to comply with this request. The controller cannot share the information under Article 6(1)(c) GDPR, as there is no \"legal obligation\". Article 6(1)(c) GDPR only covers \"obligations\" under national law, meaning regulations that require a certain processing operation. Article 6(1)(c) does not cover situations where the law permits certain conduct or processing operations. In certain cases, there may however be options to use Article 6(1)(f) GDPR to process personal data. The legal provision which defines the legal obligations for the controller does not need to be specific to each individual processing. It must, however, be sufficiently clear, precise and foreseeable and, in particular, define the purposes of the processing. [ 39 ] Processing that goes beyond these legal obligations is not lawful under this provision. Any obligation to process data under another law must itself be proportionate (Article 7 and 8 EU Charter of Fundamental Rights) and in compliance with Article 6(2) and (3) GDPR. According to Article 6(3) GDPR, the legal obligations may only be based in Union law or Member State law to which the controller is subject. This means that: Union or Member State law trigger Article 6(1)(c) GDPR, this includes laws that make foreign obligation enforceable in the Union or Member State. Any third country law (even if it applies to the controller under the laws of that third country) do not fall under Article 6(1)(c) GDPR. Any Members State law that the controller is not subject to (e.g. the laws of another Member State than his establishment) do not apply. Obligations under third country law may, according to some views, be a factor to assess a possible \"legitimate interest\" under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. Equally to Article 6(1)(c) GDPR, Article 6(2) and (3) GDPR require that Union or Member State law fulfill certain criteria. See commentary on Article 6(2) and (3) below for the commentary on this element. Article 6(1)(c) GDPR only covers situations where the controller is subject to a direct legal obligation. Obligations on the data subject or a third party do not trigger Article 6(1)(c) GDPR. A data processing may also be lawful if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. The underlying assumption here is that the right to life takes precedence over data protection and - in the case of the vital interests of the data subject - the data subject is assumed to consent to the processing. For example: The data subject is rushed to the hospital and the doctors check their medial data systems to ensure that they are fully aware of any potential complications from preexisting conditions or allergically reactions. In practice many situations where data for the \"vital interests\" are processed my concern special categories of personal data (e.g. health data) and are therefore regulated by Article 9 GDPR . Information on necessity can be found above under the overview on Article 6(1) under \"necessity\". The concept of necessity means that processing must be limited to what is strictly necessary. This does not mean that only indispensable processing is allowed. Unreasonable alternatives are not taken into account, but merely \"useful\" additional processing is not \"necessary\" Article 6(1)(d) GDPR only requires the aim to protect vital interests. The mere effort seems to be sufficient. Recital 46 clarifies that vital interests are \" essential for the life \" of the data subject. It follows that data processing on this ground \u201c requires that a situation of concrete and imminent danger exists for the data subject or a third (natural) person \u201d. [ 40 ] The provision does not require that the natural person subjectively wants to have his or her vital interests protected. The provision could consequently also apply in situations of self-harm or natural persons that do not care about the protection of their vital interests. Such an interpretation would potentially go against the concept of informational self-determination. According to the provision the \" vital interests of the data subject or another natural person \" must be protected. As data subjects are defined as natural persons under Article 4(1) GDPR , the provision could equally read \" any natural person \". Article 6(1)(e) GDPR allows processing for tasks carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, if the processing is based on EU or Member State law. The Member States have vastly different traditions in allocating tasks in the public interest. In recent decades, many tasks that were typically allocated to the government were outsources to private or quasi-private entities. Article 6(1)(e) GDPR consequently follows a \"functional\" approach. [ 41 ] It does not matter if the controller is a public authority, a private entity or a publicly owned entity. [ 42 ] Examples of entities that carry out tasks in the public interest or exercise official authority: Certain tasks of notary publics, lawyers, probation services or tax accountants; A private limited company, fully owned by the Member State, that is tasked with air-traffic control and licensing pilots; [ 43 ] Private entities tasked with technical inspections on behalf of the government (e.g. chimney sweepers); Political parties in the administration of elections; Private or non-profit health care providers or ambulance services operating on behalf of the government; Utility providers that are e.g. tasked with operating \"smart meters\"; [ 44 ] Information on necessity can be found above under the overview on Article 6(1) under \"necessity\". The concept of necessity means that processing must be limited to what is strictly necessary. This does not mean that only indispensable processing is allowed. Unreasonable alternatives are not taken into account, but merely \"useful\" additional processing is not \"necessary\". Therefore, a processing must not only be carried out in the public interest to meet the requirement of this provision; the processing has to genuinely meet the objectives of the pursued public interest without going beyond what is necessary in order to achieve these objectives. [ 45 ] The first branch covers Union or Member State laws that require public or private entities to process personal data for a task carried out in the public interest. For example: In a Member State public but also private entities are operating the ambulance services. This includes a government department but also non-profits operating ambulances. Equally full-time emergency doctors, but also local doctors in the countryside are involved in the system. They are all coordinated by a single software system. The legal basis is a national law that uses the options under Article 6(1)(e) GDPR. The second branch covers Union or Member State laws that require public or private entities to process personal data when exercising official authority. For example: A Member State has outsourced issuing and revocation of certain licenses to a private entity. The law transfers certain authority to that entity that requires the use of personal data. The entity can rely on Article 6(1)(e) GDPR. Equally to Article 6(1)(c) GDPR, Article 6(2) and (3) GDPR require that Union or Member State law fulfill certain criteria. See commentary on Article 6(2) and (3) below for the commentary on this element. Article 6(1)(f) GDPR establishes a legal basis for the processing of personal data when the \u201cprocessing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child\u201d. While Articles 6(1)(a) GDPR deals with situations where data subjects waived their rights and Articles 6(1)(b) to (e) deal with common purposes where processing is allowed, Article 6(1)(f) deals solely with situations where the controller or a third party has an interest that conflicts with the data subjects' fundamental right to data protection. There are three cumulative conditions (explained in more detail further below) that must be met in order for a processing to fall under the legal basis of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR: the pursuit of a legitimate interest by the controller or by a third party (i.e. controllers ought to verify whether their interest is actually \u201clegitimate\u201d); the need to process personal data for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued; and, the interests or fundamental freedoms and rights of the person concerned by the data protection do not take precedence over the legitimate interest of the controller or of a third party (i.e. balancing test). [ 46 ] In general, the evaluation whether a processing activity can be based on the legal basis of legitimate interest is entirely in the hands of the data controller who, taking into account the conditions described above, has discretion in how to perform such evaluation. However, the EDPB provides some guidance on how to perform such assessment. [ 47 ] In accordance with the accountability principle under Article 5(2) GDPR, a controller invoking this legal basis is responsible for, and has to be able to demonstrate, compliance with each of those cumulative conditions. Therefore, the controller should document the performance of the legitimate interest assessment accordingly. Also, if a Data Protection Officer is appointed by the controller, they should be involved by the controller in this assessment. [ 48 ] If a controller wants to rely on legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR for the processing of personal data for various purposes, the controller has to assess the validity of this legal basis for each of those purposes. [ 49 ] Article 6(1)(f) GDPR is the \"catch all\" balancing test for anything not foreseen by Articles 6(1)(b) to (e) GDPR, where the controller does not seek consent, but takes the view that the rights of the controller or a third party override  the rights of the data subject. However, this legal basis should not be considered a last resort, if no other legal basis is applicable, neither should it be used to circumvent legal requirements of other legal bases. [ 50 ] \"[...] Article 6(1)(f) should not be considered as an \u201copen door\u201d to legitimise all data processing activities which do not fall under any of the other legal bases in Article 6(1) GDPR. Rather, it should be recalled that Article 6(1)(f), like each of the legal bases set out in Article 6(1) GDPR, must be interpreted restrictively.\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 1/2024 on processing of personal data based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR', 8 October 2024 (Version 1), margin number 9 (available here). Even though the controller has to perform a careful assessment for each planned processing activity based on the legal basis of legitimate interest and follow a specific methodology, the flexibility and open-endedness of this clause also leads to major legal uncertainty for controllers and data subjects. While Article 7(f) of the previous Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC also foresaw the option to process based on an overriding \"legitimate interest\" the previous Directive allowed Member States to implement more specific provisions for certain situations (e.g. video surveillance, credit ranking and alike). Given that the GDPR is now a directly applicable Regulation, there is no room for such national \"interpretations\". Nevertheless, many Member States have kept their national \"legitimate interest\" implementations, despite lacking the necessary jurisdiction. While this approach is meant to provide more legal certainty, it actually adds even more uncertainty. During the GDPR negotiations, Article 6(1)(f) was one of the major battle grounds between the legislator and industry lobbyists. The European Commission foresaw a right of the Commission itself to pass delegated acts that would further define Article 6(1)(f) GDPR - this was rejected by the European Parliament. Various proposals to add explanatory lists of what does and what does not constitute a legitimate interest were not getting a majority, as each side was unwilling to agree that certain elements are included or excluded. One of the political solutions was to \"park\" some of these suggestions in Recitals 47 to 49 GDPR, as one side was able to argue that the matter is now \"in the GDPR\" and the other side was able to highlight that the Recitals are not legally binding. When it comes to the contentious issue of advertisement the legislator finally added the remarkable line that \" direct marketing \" (not all advertisement) \" may \" constitute a legitimate interest. There is no indication as to when this \" may \" or \" may not \" be a legitimate interest. Article 6(1)(f) GDPR consequently requires a delicate balancing of relevant interests. The balancing act in question is not a straightforward balancing test which would simply consist of weighing two easily quantifiable and easily comparable \"weights\" against each other. As highlighted by the EDPB, the a distinction must be made between concept of interest and the concept of purpose (for more information on the concept of purpose see Article 5(1)(b) GDPR ). Interest is the general objective that a controller intends to pursue (i.e. ensuring the occupational safety of its employees). The purpose, on the other hand, is the specific aim of a certain processing activity (for instance, implementation of specific access control procedures to only allow trained personnel in certain areas of the workplace) and can include a broad range of activities, whether trivial or very compelling, straightforward or more controversial. [ 51 ] \"A 'purpose' is the specific reason why the data are processed: the aim or intention of the data processing. An 'interest', on the other hand, is the broader stake or benefit that a controller or third party may have in engaging in a specific processing activity. For example, a controller may have an interest in promoting its products, whereas this interest may be advanced by processing personal data for direct marketing purposes.\" EDPB, '1/2024 on processing of personal data based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR', 8 October 2024 (Version 1), margin number 14. Only an legitimate interest can be invoked by a controller in order to base a processing activity on the legal basis of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. There are three cumulative requirements for an interest to be considered legitimate: First , the interest hast so be lawful, i.e. the controller can legitimately pursue it and it is not contrary to EU or national law. However, it is not necessary that the interest is determined or enshrined in law. [ 52 ] For example, the CJEU did not rule out that, in principle, also a commercial interest of the controller could be regarded as a legitimate interest. [ 53 ] \"As regards, first, the condition relating to the pursuit of a \u2018legitimate interest\u2019, it should be emphasised that, in the absence of a definition of that concept in the GDPR, as the Court has previously held, a wide range of interests is, in principle, capable of being regarded as legitimate [...]\". CJEU - C\u2011621/22 - Koninklijke Nederlandse Lawn Tennisbond , margin number 38.. As to what \u201claw\u201d means in this case, in the absence of updated guidance, reference should be made to the instructions provided by the WP29 in Opinion 3/2013 on purpose limitation, according to which the notion of \"law\" must be interpreted in an extensive manner, including all forms of written or common law, as interpreted by the competent courts and supplemented by other official sources. [ 54 ] The above seems to be confirmed by the recent guidelines on contract-based treatment. There, the EDPB clarified that the contract (and thus, by analogy, the legitimate interest) must be valid i.e. \u201c must comply with the requirements of contract laws and, as the case may be for consumer contracts, consumer protection laws in order for processing based on those terms to be considered fair and lawful \u201d. [ 55 ] Also, reference can be made to the Cookie Banner Taskforce, deeming the usage of legitimate interest for activities such as \u201ccreate a personalised content profile\u201d unlawful. The taskforce agreed that such processing requires consent according to Article 5(4) ePrivacy Directive. [ 56 ] Second , the pursued interest has to be clearly and precisely articulated in order to ensure that the assessment of necessity and the balancing of interests can be performed in a an accurate and proper manner. [ 57 ] Therefore, a interest only expressed in vague or general terms is not sufficiently articulated to assess its legitimacy and therefore cannot be a legitimate interest. [ 58 ] At this point, reference can also be made to the requirement to inform data subjects about the legitimate interest pursued in accordance with Article 13(1)(d) GDPR and Article 14(2)(b) GDPR . According to the CJEU, without this information to the data subject, it cannot be justified to base a processing of personal data on the legitimate interest. [ 59 ] Third , the persuaded interest must not be just speculative. To the contrary, the pursued interest must be real and present. This means that the legitimate interest must be present at the date of the processing of personal data; a mere hypothetical interest is not sufficient. [ 60 ] A wide variety of interests can potentially fulfil all three conditions and be therefore considered legitimate. Recital 47 GDPR additionally mentions a relevant and appropriate relationship between the data subject and the controller as potential indicator for the existence of a legitimate interest. However, such a relationship is neither necessary nor a guarantor for a interest to be legitimate. [ 61 ] The legitimate interest at stake must also be \u201c pursued by the controller or a third party \u201d. However, the interest pursued by a controller should be related to the actual activities of that controller. [ 62 ] For example: A social media platform can not rely on a legitimate interest of preventing, detecting and prosecuting criminal offences, for the sharing of personal data with law-enforcement agencies, since this is unrelated to its economic and commercial activity and can therefore not constitute a legitimate interest pursued by the social media platform. [ 63 ] The pursue of interests of one or more third parties can also subject of this provision. Regularly, a processing activity will be in the interest of the controller as well as in the interest of third parties. The clarification of the specific beneficiaries of a processing activity prior to the actual processing is therefore crucial in order to assess the necessity of the processing and to perform a proper balancing test. [ 64 ] The EDPB provides some guidance on contexts in which personal data may be processed in the interest of a third party, mentioning cases like the defence of legal claims, the disclosure of data for transparency and accountability purposes, and scientific research. [ 65 ] Even if some interests pursued by a controller could also benefit the general public, it should be pointed out that the general public itself does not constitute a third party under Article\u00a06(1)(f) GDPR. [ 66 ] In situations where personal data is processed for a purpose other than that for which the data was initially collected (e.g. when data is initially collected for purposes of the controller and then further processed in the legitimate interest of a third party), the rules for further processing (also called \"secondary use\") under Articles 5(1)(b) and 6(4) GDPR apply. In the absence of consent or a law explicitly allowing it such a further processing, \u201c is permitted only if it is compatible with the purpose of the initial processing \u201d). Additionally, it should be noted that according to Article 6(1) GDPR, public authorities cannot invoke the legal basis of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR in the performance of their tasks. [ 67 ] Necessity is a condition for all legal bases but consent. Therefore, see the paragraph on necessity in general above. \"Second, with regard to the condition that the processing of personal data be necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued, that condition requires the referring court to ascertain that the legitimate data processing interests pursued cannot reasonably be achieved just as effectively by other means less restrictive of the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular the rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter [...]\" CJEU - C\u2011621/22 - Koninklijke Nederlandse Lawn Tennisbond , margin number 42.. The fact that the controller has a legitimate interest and the processing is necessary for the pursued legitimate interest is not enough for a controller to rely on Article 6(1)(f) as a legal basis for the processing. The third condition is that the legitimate interest pursued is not overridden by the interests and fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects. Therefore, the it is necessary to perform a balancing test between the legitimate interests of the controller or of a third party on the one hand and the interests or fundamental freedoms and rights of the data subjects on the other hand. \"This \u201cbalancing exercise\u201d between the fundamental rights, freedoms and interests at stake must be performed for each processing to be based on legitimate interest as a legal basis, and must be done before carrying out the relevant processing operation(s).\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 1/2024 on processing of personal data based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR', 8 October 2024 (Version 1), margin number 7 (available here). To do so, the EDPB suggests a four-step test including: assessing the data subjects' interest, fundamental rights and freedoms; identifying the impact of the processing on data subjects (e.g. the nature of the processed data, the context of the processing, and any further consequences of the processing); the reasonable expectations of the data subject; and the balancing of the opposing rights and interests (taking into account any possible mitigation measures like additional safeguards). [ 68 ] \"It should be recalled that the purpose of the balancing exercise is not to avoid any impact on the interests and rights of the data subjects altogether. Rather, its purpose is to avoid a disproportionate impact and to assess the weight of these aspects in relation to each other.\" EDPB, '1/2024 on processing of personal data based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR', 8 October 2024 (Version 1), margin number 33. In general, the definition of \u201cfundamental rights and freedom\u201d includes all the traditional rights foreseen in the European constitutions, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU as well as the European Convention on Human Rights. This obviously includes the right to the protection of personal data, personal and family life, freedom of expression and human dignity. In addition to the fundamental rights of the data subject, other \u201cfreedoms or interests\u201d must also be taken into account. This includes the interest not to suffer any economic disadvantages, regardless of whether the damage occurs following the publication of personal data or in another way, such as via a discriminatory personalised pricing policy. [ 69 ] The EDPB also lists various other freedoms and interests like the prohibition of discrimination and personal interests . [ 70 ] Finally, it should be noted that - unlike in the case of the controller\u2019s interests - the data subject's interest apparently does not have to be legitimate. A wider scope to the protection of individuals\u2019 interests and rights is therefore implied. This means that even individuals engaged in unlawful activities should not be subject to disproportionate interference regarding their rights and interests. For example, \u201c an individual who may have perpetrated theft in a supermarket could still see his interests prevailing against the publication of his picture and private address on the walls of the supermarket and/or on the Internet by the owner of the shop .\u201d [ 71 ] Once the data subjects' interests and fundamental rights have been identified, an assessment of the impact (negative as well as positive) on data subjects should be performed by the controller. In order to perform a comprehensive assessment, the EDPB recommends to consider among others: (i) the nature of the processed data, (ii) the context of the processing, and (iii) any further consequences of the processing. [ 72 ] Several elements can be useful at this stage, including the likelihood that a risk can materialise and the severity of its consequences. Also, the scale of the processing (i.e. the number of individuals potentially impacted as well as the volume of data) and other circumstances of the processing should be considered. Also of relevance is the way the information is being processed, whether it is shared with a large number of actors or persons or combined with other data sets. For example, in a case involving the lawfulness of a CCTV surveillance system, the CJEU considered different factors including whether the data to be processed were retrieved from publicly accessible sources or were rather related to the data subject\u2019s private life; the nature of the data, particularly their sensitiveness; and the modalities of processing, including the number of persons having access to the data. [ 73 ] In general, it appears that the more sensitive the information involved is, the more consequences for the data subject there may be. It should be noted that the processing of special categories of data is only allowed in the cases listed in Article 9(2) GDPR . [ 74 ] Reference can also be made to the factors a controller has to consider also during the assessment of risks connected to a processing activity (among others, see commentary on Article 24 , 25 and 32 ). Article 6(1)(f) GDPR explicitly mentions situations \" in particular where the data subject is a child \". This indicates that a balancing test needs to take the specific interests and expectations of a child into account. [ 75 ] In the context of the balancing test and the potential impact on the data subject importance should be attached to the relationship between the data subjects and the controller. E.g. the CJEU held that the transfer of personal data by a sports association to a provider of casino games for marketing activities did not appear to be characterised by a relevant and appropriate relationship between the association and its members whose personal data were transmitted. [ 76 ] Also, any potential harmful effects and other consequences on the data subjects must be considered in course of the balancing test. [ 77 ] \"The controller may need to take into account also possible broader emotional impacts resulting from a data subject losing control over personal information, or realising that it has been misused or compromised. The chilling effect on protected behaviour, such as freedom of research or freedom of expression, that may result from continuous monitoring/tracking or from the risk of being identified, should also be given due consideration. For example, continuous online monitoring of online activities by a platform may give rise to the feeling that a data subject\u2019s private life is being continuously observed.\" EDPB, '1/2024 on processing of personal data based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR', 8 October 2024 (Version 1), margin number 46. The assessment of the (potential) impact on data subjects should not be made under the assumption that all data subjects have the same interests - especially, when it is likely that the some of the affected data subjects have diverging interests. [ 78 ] Recital 47 GDPR stipulates that the reasonable expectations of the data subjects should be considered. In particular, it is important to evaluate whether the status of the data controller, the nature of the relationship or the service provided, or the applicable legal or contractual obligations (or other promises made at the time of collection) could give rise to reasonable expectations of stricter confidentiality and stricter limitations on further use. [ 79 ] \"[...] as regards the balancing of interests which it is for the referring court to carry out in the light of the specific circumstances of the dispute in the main proceedings, that court must take account, in particular, of the reasonable expectations of the data subject as well as the scale of the processing at issue and its impact on that person [...]\" CJEU - C\u2011621/22 - Koninklijke Nederlandse Lawn Tennisbond , margin number 54.. It is important to note that the reasonable expectations of a data subject could very well deviate from whatever is considered common practice or business standard in a certain sector. Also the fact that a processing activity is very established or has been taken place for a long time is not decisive for the question whether a processing is in the data subjects' reasonable expectations. Neither do the reasonable expectation of the data subject depend on the information provided by the data subject (e.g. in a privacy policy). [ 80 ] \"While a failure to provide information can contribute to the data subjects being surprised, the mere fulfilment of information duties according to Articles 12, 13 and 14 GDPR is not sufficient in itself to consider that the data subjects can reasonably expect a given processing.\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 1/2024 on processing of personal data based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR', 8 October 2024 (Version 1), margin number 68. The EDPB suggests that the assessment of the reasonable expectations should consider an \"average\" data subject (unless it is likely that different groups of data subjects with different characteristics are affected) and lists a number of elements, that could be considered for the assessment of what could be considered reasonable expectations. [ 81 ] At the end of the balancing test is the assessment whether the identified pursued legitimate interests of the controller or third parties are overridden by the data subjects' interests or rights and freedoms. Only if that is not the case, the controller can base its processing of personal data on the legal basis of legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. It is worth repeating that such assessment has to take place prior to the commencement of the processing activity. In particular where the data subject is a child In all the steps of the balancing test, special attention should be paid to the question whether also children could be affected by the processing activity. This is also directly stated in Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. In such a case the balancing test should be recalibrated and consider the fact that children (depending of the specific age group) might be less aware of any risks and consequences connected with the processing activity. [ 82 ] \"While this does not mean that there will never be a situation in which the interests of the child can be overridden, it does mean that the interests of children as data subjects should have high priority and will very often outweigh the interests of the controller or third parties. [\u2026] [\u2026] Article 6(1)(f) GDPR may be invoked as a legal basis by a controller where the legitimate interests pursued coincide with the interests of the child. However, when there is a conflict between a controller\u2019s legitimate interests (including regarding processing of personal data for commercial purposes) and the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of a child, the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the child should in general prevail. [\u2026] [T]here are certain types of data processing operations, such as those consisting of extensive profiling and targeted advertising activities, which - subject to certain limited exceptions - will generally not align with the obligation to ensure specific protection of children.\" EDPB, 'Guidelines 1/2024 on processing of personal data based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR', 8 October 2024 (Version 1), margin number 94 et seq. Whenever personal data of children are processed based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, the controller has to be able to demonstrate that the children's best interest were a primary consideration in the balancing test. [ 83 ] Additional safeguards In case the legitimate interest test shows that the data subjects' interests or rights and freedoms overweight the legitimate interest of the controller or third parties, the controller could introduce additional safeguards (mitigation measures) in order to archive a balance a balance between the opposing interests. However, such measures can only be implemented in addition to all other requirements that the controller is obliged to anyway. Therefore, fulfilling an information obligation in accordance with Article 13 et seq. GDRP or granting data subjects the right to object in accordance with Article 21 GDPR to a data processing can not be considered additional safeguards or mitigation measures; providing additional information or waiving any requirements under Article 21 GDPR could however be considered as a mitigating measure. [ 84 ] \"If the data subject\u2019s interests, rights and freedoms seem to override the legitimate interest(s) being pursued, the controller may consider introducing mitigating measures to limit the impact of the processing on data subjects, in view of achieving a fair balance between the rights, freedoms and interests involved.\" EDPB, '1/2024 on processing of personal data based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR', 8 October 2024 (Version 1), margin number 56. Other examples of mitigation measures include the \u201c strict limitation on how much data is collected, or immediate deletion of data after use. While some of these measures may already be compulsory under the Directive, they are often scalable and leave room for controllers to ensure better protection of data subjects \u201d as well as \u201c providing an easily workable and accessible mechanism to ensure an unconditional possibility for data subjects to opt-out of the processing \u201d. [ 85 ] These additional measures may in some cases help tip the balance and help ensure that the processing can be based on Article 6(1)(f), whilst simultaneously protecting the rights and interests of the data subjects. In any case, the controller has to perform the balancing test anew after the implementation of such additional safeguards and mitigation measures. Often, even the implementation of such measures will not change the outcome of a balancing test in favour of the interests or rights and freedoms of data subjects. In such cases Article 6(1)(f) GDPR can not be invoked as a legal basis for a processing activity. [ 86 ] The assessment if a legitimate interest overrides the interest of a data subject are always a case-by-case assessment. And it should be kept in mind that the assessment if a processing activity can be based on this legal basis could result in different outcomes in different contexts or situations. For example could the reasonable expectations of data subjects diverge immensely in different processing situations and controllers could implement different additional safeguards or could have different alternative methods to their disposal. Controllers should therefore be careful when orientating on existing case law or examples found elsewhere. However, such examples can provide some useful guidance for controllers. Some examples of situations in which legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR overrides the data subjects' freedoms and interests can be found in Recitals 47 to 49. As always, it must be stressed that Recitals are not legally binding, but nevertheless give a very good understanding of the views of the legislator. Generally the examples in Recitals 47 to 49 can be described as largely \"defensive\", in the sense that the data subject interfered with the rights of the controller or a third party and the controller is using personal data to defend against such situations. Only very limited examples seem to be \"offensive\", in the sense that the controller proactively interferes with the rights of the data subject. To give some additional orientation, it can be referred to some typical examples of cases in which a legitimate interests might override the data subject's freedoms and interests: Processing for network and information security (see Recital 49), which may even be a legal duty under Articles 6(1)(c) and 32 GDPR . [ 87 ] Protection of life, property and alike (like CCTV of areas with repeated offences or highly likely targets, such as a bank, if there are no feasible alternatives and safeguards like deletion periods and strictly limited access to recordings are ensured). Processing for the prevention of fraud (see Recital 47), such as \"black lists\" of known fraudsters. [ 88 ] The EDPB lists additional examples of legitimate interests in their Guidelines on legitimate interest. [ 89 ] However, it should be noted that the above mentioned interests should be articulated clearer and more precise when actually invoked by a controller for a specific processing activity. [ 90 ] On the other hand, the following situations are generally not seen as cases where a legitimate interest overrides the data subjects' freedoms and interests: Advertisement (other than \" direct marketing \" as under Article 13(2) of ePrivacy Directive 2002/58/EC, see below). Usually the use of personal data for mere profits is also a case where the data subjects' freedoms and interests generally override the pursued legitimate interests. It should be noted however, that the CJEU confirmed that also a commercial interest of the controller could constitute a legitimate interest, provided that it is lawful. [ 91 ] But besides the pursuit of a legitimate, the processing also needs to be necessary for the pursued interest and the rights and freedoms of the data subjects must not override those legitimate interests in order for a processing activity to be lawful. For example, in the context of a mandatory account creation on e-commerce websites, the processing of users' personal data cannot be based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR to pursue the legitimate interest of building customer loyality (especially by personalising content, offering discounts or other exclusive benefits, or by sending commercial messages to customers ), since such processing is neither necessary for pursuing this interest nor reasonably expected by users. [ 92 ] The following processing could be considered edge cases in which controllers should be especially careful when considering each step of the assessment whether legitimate interest could be a legal basis for a processing activity: Direct marketing (the Recital says this \" may\" be a legitimate interest) other than so-called \"soft spam\" in existing customer relationships under Article 13(2) of the ePrivacy Directive 2002/58/EC. [ 93 ] The sharing of information within a group of undertakings for internal administrative purposes \" may \" be a legitimate interest according to Recital 48. [ 94 ] Use or personal data in search engines, based on the public interest in information under Article 11 of the Charter  - but not the commercial interest of a search engine. However, this interest may be overridden in individual cases (see C\u2011131/12 - Google Spain and the \" right to be forgotten \"). Transmission of personal data to competent authorities in connection with possible criminal acts or threats to public security. [ 95 ] Another area with a lot of legal uncertainty is the performance of profiling in connection or in advance of different processing purposes. The EDPB highlights elements that are particularly relevant for any cases such a profiling takes place, like the level of detail and comprehensiveness of the profile and the potential impact of the profile on the data subject. [ 96 ] Paragraph 2 gives Member States competence in the public sector, [ 97 ] since it allows them to adopt, or keep, [ 98 ] their own (material) rules that regulate in which instances a controller can rely on the legal bases provided for in Article 6(1)(c) and Article 6(1)(e) GDPR. Member States can also \" determine more precisely specific requirements \" for the processing to, ultimately, ensure that this processing is lawful and fair. [ 99 ] While Member States may \" specify \" the often abstract GDPR requirements, but they may not alter them or go beyond them. Through this wording it is apparent that these national provisions must stay within, and cannot go beyond the framework of the GDPR. [ 100 ] They also concern specific processing situations under Articles 85 to 91 GDPR (freedom of expression, freedom of information, access to official documents, processing in the employment context and alike). For example: A national law may require an employer to collect personal data on employees and provide them to social security providers or the tax authority under Article 6(1)(c) GDPR. Such laws may be kept, introduced or changed by the Member States and also add elements in the national law, like specific deletion period (e.g. \"keep records for 5 years\"), setting clearer purposes that limit the use of certain data (e.g. \"only for taxation purposes\") or add specific notice requirements. Since this provision allows Member States to enact denser regulation, as well as more concrete requirements for controllers, some authors noted that this can lead to conflicts, not only between a Member State and the Commision (since the latter monitors the application of Union law), but also in case of different processing situations by the same controller or vis-\u00e0-vis the same data subject. [ 101 ] According to Article 6(3), the legal basis for processing under Article 6(1)(c) (legal obligation) and Article 6(1)(e) (public interest) must be laid down by (a) Union, or (b) Member State law. Contrary to Article 6(1)(c), however, the public interest processing does not have to be expressly laid down in a legal basis. It suffices if the processing is necessary to fulfil a task which serves the public interest, or in the exercise of official authority, and the task is described in a specific and clear manner. [ 102 ] It should be noted that the Member State law to which the controller is subject does not necessarily mean a legislative act adopted by a parliament. For example, the CJEU held that also national case-law could constitute such a legal basis. [ 103 ] \"[\u2026] as recital 41 of that regulation states, where it refers to a legal basis or a legislative measure, this does not necessarily require a legislative act adopted by a parliament, without prejudice to obligations provided for under the constitutional order of the Member State concerned. However, such a legal basis or legislative measure should be clear and precise and its application should be foreseeable to persons subject to it, in accordance with the case-law of the Court and the European Court of Human Rights. [\u2026] In that regard, it should be noted that [\u2026] it cannot be ruled out that \u2018Member State law to which the controller is subject\u2019 within the meaning of point (b) of Article 6(3) of the GDPR also covers national case-law.\" CJEU - Joined Cases C\u201117/22 and C\u201118/22 - HTB Neunte Immobilien Portfolio , margin number 68 and 71.. Requirements under non-EU/EEA laws, such as a US, Chinese or Swiss law requiring the processing of personal data, cannot be the basis for processing under Article 6(1)(c) or (e) GDPR. However, a duty under the law of another country may be a \" legitimate interest \" under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, which can be the starting point of a balancing test. Moreover, the provision allows Member States to implement specific provisions contained in this legal basis, and suggests, inter alia , the general conditions governing the lawfulness of processing by the controller; the types of data which are subject to the processing; the data subjects concerned; the entities to, and the purposes for which, the personal data may be disclosed; the purpose limitation; storage periods; and processing operations and processing procedures. These concretisations are non-exhaustive and non-binding, but are certainly permissible specific provisions. [ 104 ] Lastly, the constituent element \u2018Member State law\u2019 refers to all material law of that Member State. [ 105 ] If Member States would pass such legislation without complying with the general principles of \" proportionality \" under Article 8 and 52 of the Charter, as well as Article 6(1)(2) and (3) GDPR, Articles 23 and 85 to 91 GDPR such national laws would be inapplicable, given the supremacy of EU law. Case Law: In Joined Cases C-465/00, C-138/01 and C-139/01 - \u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk a national law foresaw to publish the income of employees of the public bodies, such as the public broadcaster for transparency reasons. The CJEU held that the disclosure of not only the amounts, but also the names of the recipients is only possible if it is truly necessary for and appropriate to the objective of proper management of public funds. While the CJEU seemed rather critical, the court left it to the Member State courts to make the ultimate determination. After the passing of the GDPR in 2016, many Member States were lobbied by local interest groups to use any possible exception. Member States have in turn extensively passed laws that go beyond the opening clauses in the GDPR. This creates massive legal uncertainty, as such laws are on the books, but may not be applied in practice. It often takes years until local courts and the CJEU annuls these laws. Case Law: The legislator in Austria has passed a total exception from all GDPR obligations for journalism. As this blanket exception went far beyond anything that is \"proportionate\" the Austrian Constitutional Court annulled the law. [ 106 ] For example in Sweden a similar provision does still exist. [ 107 ] For the average controller, it is therefore important to ensure that national laws comply with EU law requirements and are not at risk of being annulled or declared inapplicable. It is important to set out that it remains unclear how Articles 6(2) and 6(3) relate to one another, legally and systematically. [ 108 ] The exact relationship between the two clauses remains disputed. Some authors ascribe a more declaratory nature to Article 6(2), [ 109 ] and see Article 6(3) as the clause that offers the actual competence to enact material-specific data protection regulation. [ 110 ] Other authors state that Article 6(2) does permit Member States to adopt material-specific regulation, and see Article 6(3) as a clause that sets out concrete requirements for this regulation. [ 111 ] Finally, another group of authors that does not see these requirements as additional, but cumulative. [ 112 ] Article 8(2) of the Charter and Article 5(1)(b) GDPR require that personal data is only processed for original \" specified, explicit and legitimate purposes \" and that personal data is not \" processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes \". Especially the idea of re-use of personal data for \"big data\" projects and alike was at the heart of a lobby effort to limit purpose limitation in Article 5(1)(b) GDPR and allow the re-use and further use of personal data - which is in fact the antithesis of purpose limitation. Article 6(4) GDPR foresees that a data subject can waive the protections under Article 5(1)(b) GDPR by giving consent, as defined in Articles 4(11) , 6(1)(a), 7 and 8 GDPR . This option is consistent with the right to informational self-determination, where data subjects can give up their rights under the law. For example: A data subject has provided her personal data at an online shop to process her order. The controller may ask the data subject to allow the re-use of this personal data to send a birthday gift via postal mail and thereby change the purpose to advertisement. It is unclear if consent for the further use of special categories of personal data must be explicit, as required under Article 9(1)(a) GDPR . While the wording does not require explicit consent, a systematic interpretation would suggest that the change of purpose should meet the same requirements as consent to the processing of the original purpose when it comes to special categories of personal data. It is rather common that laws require the sharing of various information, such as evidence in procedures. Member States can maintain or pass such legislation and controllers may not cite purpose limitation to withhold information, as long as such laws \" constitute a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard the objectives referred to in Article 23(1) GDPR \". Other objectives are not available to Member State law. For example: An event has a participant list. The controller said the purpose of this list is merely the management of entry to the event. When a crime happened and the criminal procedure of a Member State allows to obtain any personal data for the purposes of criminal investigations, the purpose limitation by the original controller can be overridden in the public interest to allow the investigators to use this information for their criminal investigation. When it comes to the reference to EU law, there would actually be no hierarchy between Article 6(4) GDPR and any other provision that goes beyond Article 6(4) GDPR. Consequently any later legislation would simply overturn or amend the provision and Article 6(4) GDPR would loose its meaning. [ 113 ] However, because such EU or Member State law interferes with purpose limitation in Article 8(2) of the Charter, any such EU or Member State law would have to comply with all requirements of Article 52 of the Charter, including the requirement to be \" proportionate \". It may be that legal requirements are not compatible with these requirements. EU law could therefore be subject to annulment, while Member State law would be inapplicable. In addition to the option to process personal data for a (wholly) different purpose, Article 6(4) GDPR also foresees the option to have so-called \" compatible \" purposes. The idea of compatible purposes was derived from the definition of purpose limitation already known from Article 6(1)(b) of Directive 95/46/EC (\" personal data must be ... collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a way incompatible with those purposes \"). In simple terms, the fact that the Directive only prohibited processing that is \" incompatible \" with the original purpose, led to a line of argument that there must be \" compatible \" purposes too. Obviously this argumentum e contrario is rather simplistic and questionable as it can erode a core principle of EU data protection. Just because the legislator highlighted that \" incompatible \" use is prohibited does not automatically lead to the assumption that there are additional \" compatible \" purposes that are never mentioned in the law nor in Article 8(2) of the Charter. The idea of changing purposes also created a systematic conflicts with requirements to have an utmost \" specific \" purpose in a first step under Article 5(1)(b) GDPR or \" specific \" consent for a specific purpose, if the purpose can be changed anyways. [ 114 ] Nevertheless, in a battle between the European Parliament and the Council, the idea of \" compatible purposes \" was codified in Article 6(4) GDPR after all. Article 6(4) GDPR prescribes certain factors to be taken into account where a controller wishes to further process personal data for a \"compatible\" purpose, that it was not collected for initially. The factors set out in Article 6(4)(a) to (c) GDPR are not exhaustive. Notably, the new purpose does not need to be a \"sub purpose\" of the initial one. [ 115 ] Rather, compatibility can exist where the initial and further purpose are \u201c pursued \u2018together\u2019 in close vicinity \u201d or where the further purpose is \u201c a logical consequence of the initial purpose \u201d. [ 116 ] Generally the factors in Article 6(4)(a) to (e) GDPR are only examples (\" inter alia \") and are very vague. The true meaning of elements like the \" context [of the] collection \" allows almost any factor or argument to be taken into account. Given that such an assessment is usually done by a controller that seeks to expand the use of personal data beyond the limits of Article 5(1)(b) GDPR , a certain dynamic towards a rather permissible application of this paragraph is likely to occur in practice. To rely on further processing compatibility, controllers must be able to demonstrate that an assessment of all relevant risks was done. [ 117 ] Obviously for a new purpose to be \" compatible \", the original purpose and the new purpose must be related. To appreciate the compatibility of various purposes, the controller should take into account, among others, the existence of a link between the original and additional purpose, the general context in which the data are processed. Already Article 5(1)(b) GDPR clarifies that, further processing for scientific or historical research purposes, or further processing for statistical purposes should be considered to be compatible lawful processing operations. [ 118 ] The \" context of the collection \" and the \" relationship with the data subject \" seem to be very generic factors that can only be assessed on a case-by-case basis. A bank that focuses on confidentially in an upscale market and explicitly states \" we will ever only use your personal information for purposes A, B and C \" may raise certain expectations that would not suggest that personal data is further used questionable purposes. Recital 50 GDPR adds that \" the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller \" should be considered. The context of the collection may give reasons why a data subject would or would not expect the further use for other purposes. The mere fact that many controllers take a certain action may not be obvious to the data subject and the widespread violation of the law does not make an act more legal. Consequently, the mere fact that many controllers use personal data in a \"customer relationship system\" cannot be seen as a reason why such use is per se \" compatible \" with the original purpose. [ 119 ] The relationship with the data subject may also point in either direction. Mutual trust may be a factor to suggest that certain steps will or will not be taken. The provision does not suggest that close relationship with the data subject may be a factor to use personal data further. For example, if a close relationship exists, it may be more practical and therefore more reasonable to ask for consent for the further use of personal data, while this may simply not be possible for data subjects that are hard to reach. At the same time a distant data subject may have less of an expectation that his or her personal data may be used for other purposes. While the provision highlights special categories of personal data under Article 9 GDPR and personal data related to criminal convictions and offences under Article 10 GDPR , it is not limited to such personal data (\" in particular \"). Other categories of usually more sensitive information may include financial details, log-in data and alike and should also be considered in any balancing test. Obviously the possible consequences for any further use for the rights of the data subject must be considered when using personal data beyond the limits of Article 5(1)(b) GDPR . This is not limited to financial losses or other material damages, but also includes non-material damages (see Article 82(1) GDPR ) and other non-material, emotional consequences or inconveniences, such as foreseeable problems to enforce the data subjects' rights under the GDPR. The controller may introduced (additional) appropriate safeguards to ensure that the processing of personal data for a compatible purpose is mitigated. The law names, as examples, encryption and pseudonymisation. While proper encryption is a baseline requirement under Article 32 GDPR and will in most cases not lead to any additional safeguard, pseudonymisation can limit the potential impact in cases of abuse. Some other safeguards are already foreseen by law, such as the need to inform about the change of purposes in Article 13(3) or 14(4) GDPR . Additional safeguard may include the use of anonymised data, an option to opt-out from processing for the compatible purpose, beyond the rights under Article 7(4) GDPR to withdraw consent and the right to object in Article 21 GDPR . Safeguards should be \" appropriate \", meaning neither going beyond what can reasonably be implemented and achieved, nor mere window dressing. During the GDPR negotiations little attention was paid to the fact that the principle of purpose limitation has become an element of the fundamental right to data protection in Article 8(2) of the Charter. Especially the notion of \" compatible purposes \" seems to stretch the possibilities of the legislator. Given that Article 8(2) of the Charter does not foresee \" compatible \" purposes any such \" compatible \" purpose must be seen as a limitation of Article 8(2) of the Chater, which must comply with Article 52 of the Charter. The very vague nature of the open-ended compatibility test in Article 6(4) GDPR itself may already be conflicting with the requirement that any limitation of Charter rights must be foreseen by precise enough law. The CJEU has so far not been asked to assess the compatibility of Article 6(4) GDPR with Articles 8(2) and 52 of the Charter. As a minimum, Article 6(4) GDPR must be interpreted \" in the light of the Charter \", which may limit the application in many cases. While Article 6(4) GDPR may be used for unforeseen needs to change the purpose, a structural re-use of personal data for initially undisclosed purposes may conflict with the duties under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR \" fairness \" and \" transparency \", the general requirement to define the purposes in Article 5(1)(b) GDPR during collection and the requirement to provide (initial) information in a \" transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language \" under Article 12(1) GDPR . Under Article 13(3) or 14(4) GDPR the controller must inform the data subject prior to making any changes to the purpose. This includes any change based on Union or Member State law and the use of personal data for any \" compatible \" purpose. The finding that a purpose is \" compatible \" or that there is a legal basis to process personal data for another purpose in Union or Member State law, does not mean that other provisions of the GDPR must not be complied with for such further processing. Some authors rely on the (non-binding) Recital 50 GDPR to argue that processing for another purpose does not require a legal basis under Article 6(1) GDPR. [ 120 ] However, the authors of the GDPR have highlighted that this was an error in the drafting. [ 121 ] This view is also supported by a systematic reading of the law. The requirement to have a legal basis for any processing operation is enshrined in Article 8(2) of the Charter, Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and Article 6(1) GDPR. At the same time Article 6(4) GDPR clearly only further defines Article 5(1)(b) GDPR. Against the clear wording of the law and the obvious systematic relationship between Article 5(1)(b) and 6(4) GDPR, a non-binding Recital cannot override the law. Consequently, further processing must still have a legal basis under Article 6(1) GDPR, be \"fair\" under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and alike. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 6 GDPR \u2191 See an overview on German criticism in Buchner/Petri , in K\u00fchling, Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 6 GDPR, margin number 14 (C.H.

The Board shall ensure the consistent application of this Regulation. To that end, the Board shall, on its own initiative or, where relevant, at the request of the Commission, in particular: 2.   Where the Commission requests advice from the Board, it may indicate a time limit, taking into account the urgency of the matter. 3.   The Board shall forward its opinions, guidelines, recommendations, and best practices to the Commission and to the committee referred to in Article 93 and make them public. 4.   The Board shall, where appropriate, consult interested parties and give them the opportunity to comment within a reasonable period. The Board shall, without prejudice to Article 76, make the results of the consultation procedure publicly available. Article 70 GDPR is a crucial component of Section 3 of Chapter VII. This provision delimitates the content and scope of the duties and powers entrusted to the Board for the purpose of ensuring the consistent application of the Regulation across the Union. The powers afforded to the Board under Article\u00a070\u00a0GDPR differentiate it from the Article 29 Working Party (\u201c WP29 \u201d), which was confined to solely an advisory role. Articles 70(1)(a) and 70(1)(t) GDPR grant the EDPB an important and new role regarding the Regulation\u2019s consistency mechanism. [ 1 ] In particular, the Board is required to issue opinions on draft measures by supervisory authorities under the consistency mechanism (Article 64(1) GDPR); opinions on matters of general application, or producing effects in more than one member state, in particular where a competent supervisory authority does not comply with obligations for mutual assistance (Article 64(2) GDPR); binding decisions under the dispute resolution procedure (Article 65 GDPR); and binding decisions where a supervisory authority has adopted provisional measures under the urgency procedure and considers a need for definitive action (Article 66 GDPR). The EDPB adopted its first binding decision under the Article 65 GDPR dispute resolution procedure on 9 November 2020 regarding a draft decision by the Irish Supervisory Authority. The draft decision concerned a data breach by Twitter, to which supervisory authorities in Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy and Spain had objected to. [ 2 ] The EDPB had asked the Irish Supervisory Authority to re-assess the elements it relied upon in its calculation of the fine to be imposed on Twitter, and to amend its draft decision by increasing the fine in order to ensure it fulfils its purpose as a corrective measure. [ 3 ] Article 70(1)(b) GDPR states that the Commission may consult the EDPB on any issue regarding data protection in the Union. This provision is similar to that in Article 42 of Regulation 2018/1725, which states the Commission may consult either the EDPS, in relation to legislative proposals or drafts implementing measures impacting data protection, or, both the EDPS and EDPB jointly, where such proposals are of particular importance. On 13 May 2019, the Commission submitted its first request for a joint opinion of this kind on the draft Implementation Decision on eHealth. [ 4 ] The EDPB and EDPS have also submitted joint advice to the European Parliament, although the GDPR does not specifically provide for this. [ 5 ] Under Article 70(1)(e) GDPR, the EDPB must examine \u2013 either on its own initiative or in response to a request from a member of the Commission \u2013 questions regarding the Regulation's application; as well as issue guidelines, recommendations, and best practices. Articles 70(1)(f)-(j) GDPR specify areas in which guidelines should be issued, namely profiling, data breaches, risk to data subject rights and freedoms, binding corporate rules, and data transfers. As Schiedermair emphasises, these guidelines are an \u201c important building block in the effort to gradually dismantle \u201d the varied enforcement of data protection law by member states. [ 6 ] The Meijers Committee, an independent group researching and advising on privacy law, has highlighted the potential risks of soft law instruments such as these guidelines, recommendations, and best practices, which are in practice often treated as law. Soft law can consequently have legal effects, which means it requires a specific legal basis. Moreover, soft law may lack \u201c safeguards, transparency and the involvement of democratically chosen bodies or interested citizens or organisations ...\" [ 7 ] Docksey notes that the EDPB\u2019s competence to issue guidelines, recommendations, and best practices under Article 70 GDPR largely avoids these risks. [ 8 ] Importantly, the EDPB has a clear statutory mandate to ensure the consistent application of the GDPR  as explicitly stated in Article 70(1) GDPR. Article 70(4) GDPR also requires the EDPB, \u201c where appropriate \u201d, to consult interested stakeholders and provide them with the opportunity to comment, and the results of this consultation must be made public. The fact that Article 70(1)(l) GDPR only requires the Board to review the practical application of guidelines, recommendations, and best practices referred to in Articles\u00a070(1)(e) and 70(1)(f) GDPR was an editorial error. This obligation applies to all guidance issued by the Board. [ 9 ] Articles 70(1)(n) to (q) GDPR outline the EDPB\u2019s responsibilities regarding the drawing up of codes of conduct, and the accreditation of certification bodies pursuant to Articles 40-41 GDPR and Articles 42-43 GDPR, respectively. On certification, the EDPB must encourage the creation of codes of conduct on certification mechanisms (Article 70(1)(n) GDPR), as well as actually accredit the certification bodies, regularly review them, and keep a public register (Article 70(1)(n) GDPR). The latter requirement conflicts with the wording of Article\u00a043(1)\u00a0GDPR, which only requires national supervisory authorities to carry out accreditation. Article\u00a070(1)(n) GDPR thus contains an editorial error as the EDPB is merely required to review accreditation decisions by national supervisory authorities. Article 70(2) GDPR postulates that where the Commission requests advice from the EDPB, it may indicate a time limit, taking into account the urgency of the matter. However, the question of whether such a time limit is binding for the EDPB is unclear. Some Commentators argue that it is not binding but that the EDPB should give priority to corresponding requests from the Commission and inform it that the deadline cannot be met and for what reasons, or at minimum provide by when the Committee is able to deliver the desired opinion. [ 10 ] However, there is no consensus on this point, as other Commentators have suggested that an option for leeway exists only in cases of Article 64(2) GDPR but not the context of Article 70(2) GDPR. [ 11 ] According to Article 70(3) GDPR, the EDPB is obligated to \u201c forward its opinions, guidelines, recommendations, and best practices to the Commission and to the committee referred to in Article 93 and make them public .\u201d At the same time, it has to publish all these working results, as the Article 29 Working Party has always done. For the decisions in the consistency mechanism, a more precise publication obligation results from Article 65(5) GDPR. The opinions, guidelines, recommendations and best practices are also published online. [ 12 ] Article 70(4) GDPR requires the EDPB, where appropriate, to consult interested groups and provide them with the opportunity to comment. Interested groups may include data protection experts from science and practice, interested groups may also include any other groups active regarding data protection issues. [ 13 ] In practice, the Board conducts consultations ex ante , by hosting workshops and \u2018fablabs,\u2019 and ex post , by providing stakeholders the opportunity to comment on draft guidelines.

The Board shall draw up an annual report regarding the protection of natural persons with regard to processing in the Union and, where relevant, in third countries and international organisations. The report shall be made public and be transmitted to the European Parliament, to the Council and to the Commission. 2.   The annual report shall include a review of the practical application of the guidelines, recommendations and best practices referred to in point (l) of Article 70(1) as well as of the binding decisions referred to in Article 65. Article 71 GDPR aims to enhance transparency in accordance with the principles of transparency and good governance, under Article 15 Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\" TFEU \") and Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (\" CFR \"). Following concerns from the Commission that the Board's predecessor, the Article 29 Working Party (\u201c WP29 \u201d), lacked transparency, European legislators sought to remedy the issue through the inclusion of a reporting obligation under Article 71 GDPR. [ 1 ] The report is not designed to simply act as a summary of the EDPB\u2019s activities, but rather a status report on data protection in the Union, as well as in third countries \u201c where relevant .\u201d [ 2 ] The phrase \u201c where relevant \u201d is intended to clarify that third countries will only be referred to where the data of EU individuals are processed. Irrespective of this, the EDPB may also monitor international developments in data protection for other reasons. [ 3 ] Although made public, the annual report is directly transmitted to the European Parliament, Council, and Commission, giving it a distinctive political orientation. [ 4 ] These bodies may use the report as an opportunity to take action in their own capacity. For example, the Commission may initiate infringement proceedings against Member States that the EDPB confirms have violated the GDPR. [ 5 ] Public bodies should be openly named in the annual report as they have no reasonable expectation of privacy. Whether private entities are named must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Factors justifying the publication of an entity's name may include considerations such as, whether the organisation has committed persistent violations of the GDPR, or whether there have been legal proceedings instigated against the entity. [ 6 ] Article 71(2) GDPR establishes several specific requirements for the content of the annual report. First, the report must include a review of the EDPB\u2019s statements, guidelines, recommendations, and best practices published under Article 70(3) GDPR. Though Article 70(3) GDPR already obliges the EDPB to make these public, Article 71(2) GDPR ensures that the public is provided with an overview of acts adopted during the relevant reporting period. [ 7 ] Additionally, the report must include any binding decisions issued in dispute resolution procedures under Article 65(1) GDPR. Article 65(5) GDPR also obliges the EDPB to publish such decisions on its website. Beyond these specific requirements, the EDPB has a wide discretion as to which information is included in the annual report. This has previously included a summary of its most important statements and resolutions, and statements on the activities of supervisory authorities.

The Board shall take decisions by a simple majority of its members, unless otherwise provided for in this Regulation. 2.   The Board shall adopt its own rules of procedure by a two-thirds majority of its members and organise its own operational arrangements. Article 72 GDPR regulates the Board's voting procedure. Generally, the GDPR grants the EDPB a high degree of autonomy. In particular, Article 72(2) GDPR entitles the Board to adopt its own procedural rules and operational arrangements, subject to an internal two-thirds majority vote. This autonomy is rooted in the legislative aim of ensuring the Board's independence, as provided for through Article 69 GDPR. Article 72(1) GDPR establishes that the EDPB shall operate by simple majority. Deviating majority requirements are only permissible insofar as they are provided for in the GDPR. This procedural rule is intended to enable the EDPB to swiftly make a large number of timely decisions to effectively manage the implementation of the GDPR. Unlike the voting procedure of other EU institutions, there are neither blocking minorities nor veto positions. A decision of the \u201c last member \u201d does not exist at the EDPB in this respect. [ 1 ] In principle, the majority of the voting members of the EDPB decides. According to the wording of the provision, the majority of the members present is not sufficient. The voting members always include the heads of the supervisory authority of each Member State (Article 68(3) GDPR). The EDPS is a member, but has only limited voting rights pursuant to Article 68(6) GDPR. In this respect, the minimum number of positive votes required for a decision changes depending on the voting rights of the EDPS. The Commission, however, is never to be taken into account. First, this already follows from the fact that, according to Article 68(3) GDPR, the Commission is not a member of the EDPB. Secondly, Article 68(5) GDPR explicitly states that the Commission has no voting rights. With currently 27 Member States (the three EFTA states that have acceded the EDPB are not entitled to vote), 14 members or, in the case of the EDPS with voting rights, 15 members must vote in favour of a decision. The term \u201c decision \u201d is to be understood broadly. [ 2 ] The GDPR only provides for two exceptions to the simple majority rule, where a two-thirds majority is required. These exceptions are for dispute resolution in the consistency mechanism under Article 65(2)(1) GDPR and the adoption of the EDPS\u2019s rules of procedure under Article 72(2) GDPR. Notably, each EDPB member is granted one vote regardless of the size of its population. This arrangement may give rise to the risk that a majority of smaller members will win a vote despite the fact that they only represent the data protection interests of a small proportion of the European population, despite the fact that decisions affect individuals in all Member States. [ 3 ] This makeup arguably threatens the democratic legitimacy of the EDPB\u2019s decisions, and creates the risk that corporations and associations will exert their influence, particularly in smaller Member States where their role in the national economy is crucial. Nguyen argues that this risk is offset by Article 52(1) GDPR which protects SAs from illegitimate influence. [ 4 ] In many places, the GDPR contains provisions (\u201c leges speciales \u201d) that explicitly require a simple majority, although the principle of simple majority is already contained in Article 72(1) GDPR. This requirement is superfluous for the purposes of the EDPB opinion provided for in the consistency mechanism under Article 64(3)(2) GDPR and for the election of the Chair and the two deputy chairs under Article 73(1) GDPR. In the case of the latter provision, the wording of which differs from Article 72(1) GDPR, has lead to the view that the majority of the members present would be sufficient. This is not the case. [ 5 ] In contrast, the emphasis on the requirement of a simple majority for dispute resolution under Article 65(3)(1) GDPR and for consistency decisions in the urgency procedure under Article 66(4) GDPR is necessary, as these are in this respect backward exceptions. The actual scope of application of the principle introduced in Article 72(1) GDPR in this regard extends to the recommendations, guidelines and best practices under Article 70 GDPR (beyond letter (t)). However, the provision does not apply to decisions not provided for by the GDPR, which the EDPB may introduce through its own independent procedure. Under Article 72(2) GDPR the Board may adopt its own rules of procedure, [ 6 ] unless these would undermine the principle of simple majority for decisions provided for in the GDPR in the broader sense. In the instance of a tie, the procedure under Article 65(3)(2) GDPR could also be applied to decisions made by the EDPB. The procedural regulations in Article 65(3)(2) GDPR establish that in the event of a tie, a decision by the Chair is taken. In practice though, the question of what procedure applies in the instance of a tie has yet to come up. The current rules of procedure only provide for simple majorities. For example, these include the rules regulating the dismissal of the Chair and, or deputy chairs in Article 6(2) Rules of Procedure (\u201c RoP \u201d), the holding of extraordinary plenary meetings under Article 18(2) RoP, the holding of a secret ballot under Article 22(4) RoP and the holding of written procedure under Article 24(1) RoP. Article 72(2) GDPR grants the EDPB regulatory autonomy. It can and should decide on the introduction, amendment and abolition of rules on internal working practices and conduct. [ 7 ] According to the provision, a two-thirds majority of the voting members is required for this \u2013 as an exception within the meaning of Article 72(1) GDPR. The GDPR does not contain detailed content requirements for the RoP. Article 74(2) GDPR only stipulates that the allocation of tasks between the Chair and the deputy chairs shall be laid down therein. Furthermore, Article 76(1) GDPR empowers the EDPB to declare discussions confidential in the rules of procedure if the Board deems it necessary. The EDPB is clearly not entitled to establish rules that deviate from the GDPR. Examples are the specific procedural, cooperation and information provisions of the consistency mechanism under Articles 64 et seq. GDPR; the essential organisational decisions regarding composition; the election of and representation by the Chair; the different limited participation of the Commission and the EDPS; as well as the reporting obligations under Article 71 GDPR. [ 8 ] The EDPB first made use of its procedural autonomy when the GDPR came into force on 25 May 2018. The Rules of Procedure (RoP) have been amended several times since then, most recently on 6 April 2022 (8th version). The current version can be found here . The current RoP are divided into eight sections: 1. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Legal nature, tasks and guiding principles of the EDPB (Articles 1 to 3 RoP) 2. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Composition of the EDPB (Articles 4 to 9 RoP) 3. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Adoption of documents and procedure (Articles 10 to 13 RoP) 4. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Secretariat and organisation (Articles 14 to 17 RoP) 5. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Working methods including plenary meetings (Articles 18 to 30 RoP) 6. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 General provisions (Articles 31 to 36 RoP) 7. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Coordinated Supervision Committee (Article 37 RoP) 8. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Final provisions (Articles 38 to 41 RoP) First, some procedural provisions should be highlighted. For example, the EDPB introduced a written and electronic voting procedure with Article 24 RoP. For its implementation, a simple majority decision of the EDPB is required (Article 24(1) RoP). This provision ensures the EDPB's flexibility and ability to act. [ 9 ] The EDPB also made use of the authorisation in Article 76(1) GDPR and declared the election of the Chair and the deputy chairs confidential in Article 6(1) RoP. In organisational terms, the end of the term of office of the Chair and the deputy chairs was regulated, thus filling the corresponding gaps in the GDPR. [ 10 ] Furthermore, so-called expert subgroups were introduced by Articles 25 and 26 RoP. These are mainly to prepare the meetings of the EDPB. They consist of members of the Board (i.e. also the EDPS) and are to be supported by staff of the Secretariat (Article 25(4) RoP). Finally, the EDPB has also made use of another power not included in the GDPR. Article 62 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 provides that the EDPS and national SAs shall conduct coordinated supervision to ensure effective supervision of large-scale IT systems and of Union bodies, offices and agencies. To this end, the EDPB's Rules of Procedure provide for the establishment of the coordinated supervision committee in Article 37 RoP. This body is autonomous, which is shown in particular by the fact that it adopts its own rules of procedure under Article 37(3) RoP. [ 11 ] Arguably, the EDPB may also determine details of its operational arrangements on an ad hoc basis by means of separate resolutions. A determination in the rules of procedure would not be necessary if it was not a general determination of procedures for the future. This view is justified by the open wording of Article 72(2) GDPR. The wording also leads to the conclusion that ad hoc decisions on procedures do not require a two-thirds majority. [ 12 ] This view is to be agreed with. The organisation of \u201c operational arrangements \u201d may be understood as an explication of the term \u201c rules of procedure \u201d. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 72 GDPR \u2191 Brink, Wilhelm , in BeckOK DatenschutzR, Article 72 GDPR, margin number 5 (C.H.

The Board shall elect a chair and two deputy chairs from amongst its members by simple majority. 2.   The term of office of the Chair and of the deputy chairs shall be five years and be renewable once. Article 73 GDPR establishes the hierarchical framework of the Board. The purpose of this provision is primarily to regulate the election procedure and term of office of the Chair and its two deputy chairs, establishing that the election procedure is through simple majority and that the term of office is five years. For the role of the Chair, refer to Articles 68 and 74 GDPR. The Chair is the representative of the EDPB and is sometimes referred to as the \u201c mouthpiece of the data protection supervisory authorities in Europe \u201d. [ 1 ] As was the case with the Article 29 Working Party (\u201c WP29 \u201d), the Chair is assisted by two deputy chairs. The advantage of this arrangement is that it allows for three Member State supervisory authorities to participate in a decisive position on the Board. [ 2 ] All members of the Board are entitled to stand for election. Pursuant to Article 68(3) GDPR, Board members are the heads of Member State supervisory authorities and the European Data Protection Supervisor ( \"EDPS\" ). [ 3 ] The Commission has the right to participate in the activities and meetings of the EDPB (Article 68(5)(1) GDPR), but is not a member. Legally, it is possible for the EDPS to stand as an electoral candidate for Chair; however, in actuality this would be impracticable for two reasons. Firstly, the EDPS holds limited voting rights under Article 68(6) GPDR. Secondly, there is an organisational separation between the secretariat and the EDPS for the purposes of to Articles 75(2) and 75(3) GDPR. The independence of the EDPB vis-\u00e0-vis the EDPS can be ensured more easily if the EDPS, who provides the secretariat to the Board, does not also chair the EDPB. [ 4 ] Otherwise, if the EDPS were to stand Chair of the Board, under Article 75(4) GDPR, it would have to conclude an internal agreement with the EDPB. [ 5 ] The active right to vote corresponds to a right of passive suffrage; meaning that all members of the EDPB, but not the three acceded EFTA states, can vote. The simple majority requirement aligns with those under Article 72(1) GDPR. [ 6 ] Various commentators have taken the position that the term simple majority is to mean a simple majority of the voting members of the Committee present . [ 7 ] The proponents of this view argue that a deviating majority requirement is intended to prevent the any attempted obstruction to the EDPB's ability to act if several members do not attend the election. [ 8 ] This reading should be rejected. A simple majority requirement is needed for the election of the Chair and two deputy chairs, but also for all other decisions taken by the Board. It is not apparent why the principle laid down in Article 72(1) GDPR should be deviated from. Article 72(1) GDPR stipulates that the Board shall take decisions by a simple majority of its members, unless otherwise provided for. Nothing in the wording of Article 73(1) GDPR would suggest an intended derogation from Article 72(1) GDPR, the provision makes no reference to the physical presence of members. Furthermore, the simple majority principle under Article 72(1) GDPR would have applied regardless of Article 73(1) GDPR. In addition, the GDPR explicitly legislates for a simple majority procedure elsewhere, namely in Article 64(3)(2) GDPR. Consequently, it is unlikely that legislators would have intended the term simple majority to mean a simple majority of the voting members present. Furthermore, the view of the authors cited above is based on the understanding of the term under German constitutional law, which interprets simple majority to mean a majority of the members present. In contrast, there is no uniform Union law understanding of the term. In addition, a historical argument applies. The Chair and deputy chairs of the WP29 were also elected with a simple majority in the sense of Article 72(1) GDPR. It is unclear why this should now be deviated from without any explicit instruction within the legislative text to do so. In support of our reading, is the fact that the Chair of the EDPB is vested with broader powers than the Chair of its predecessor. In particular, the EDPB Chair is authorised to make a casting vote in accordance with Article 65(3) GDPR. [ 9 ] In this respect, their election would require a higher ascription to democratic principles rather than lower.If the reading of the term simple majority were to be taken in the sense of German constitutional law, it would be possible for the Chair to be elected by one present member, if the rest were not present. Such an outcome could not be intended by the legislature. Finally, the EDPB's own internal procedures are in support of the view expressed here. Article 5(1) Rules of Procedure (\u201c RoP \u201d) provides that the election of the Chair and the deputy chairs shall be by secret ballot, \"by simple majority of members entitled to vote that are present or represented through delegation.\" Article 5(1) RoP provides that voting members are not needed to be present, and may be represented through delegation instead in accordance with Article 22(5) RoP. Article 22(5) RoP provides that \"every member of the Board entitled to vote who is not represented at a plenary meeting, can delegate its voting rights to another member of the Board entitled to vote and attending the plenary meeting. The Chair and the secretariat shall be notified of any delegation of voting rights.\" Article 73(2) GDPR stipulates that a term of office is five years, with the possibility of renewal once. In total, elected persons can thus hold office for a maximum period of ten years. The limited term of office not only ensures that the position of Chair is not held by a sole person for an indefinite amount of time, but also ensures that the representation of the Member States holding important offices change regularly. [ 10 ] The EDPB has made use of its procedural autonomy and has laid down three further termination variants in Article 6(1) and 6(2) RoP which outline the end of the term of office, resignation, and dismissal. According to Article 6(2) RoP, the dismissal of the Chair or a deputy chair can be made by a resolution passed by a simple majority of Board members. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 73 GDPR \u2191 Nguyen , in Gola, DS-GVO, Article 73 GDPR, margin number 1 (C.H.

3.2 (2) Allocation of Tasks 3.1 (1) Tasks of the Chair 3.2 (2) Allocation of Tasks 4 Decisions 5 References 1.   The Chair shall have the following tasks: 2.   The Board shall lay down the allocation of tasks between the Chair and the deputy chairs in its rules of procedure. The Regulation establishes the existence of, and governs the functioning of the Board and its Chair. Article 74 GDPR outlines the powers and tasks afforded to the Chair in relation to the running of the Board. Generally, the Regulation allows for the Board to enjoy a wide degree of autonomy, [ 1 ] which too has been extended to the Chair. For instance, paragraph two of this provision allows for the Board to lay down the allocation of tasks between the Chair and the deputy chairs in its rules of procedure. The Board and its Chair, as the successors of the Article 29 Working Party (\u201c WP29 \u201d), inherit the functions served by the WP29 but notably, are allocated a wider array of duties and powers. In particular, the Chair of the Board is afforded broader powers than the Chair of the WP29. Under Article 65(3) GDPR, the Chair is able to issue a casting vote in the instance of stalemate, which is a power not enjoyed by its predecessor. [ 2 ] Article 74(1) GDPR mandates a list of responsibilities to the Chair. Namely, these responsibilities include convening the meetings of the Board, preparing its agenda, notifying decisions adopted by the Board under Article 65 GDPR to the authorities, and ensuring the timely performance of the tasks of the Board in relation to the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63 GDPR. The aforementioned tasks are supplemented by duties found in other provisions of the Regulation. In particular, the Chair represents the Board (Article 68(2) GDPR) and is responsible for directing the work of the secretariat (Article 75(2) GDPR). Other specific responsibilities arise from the consistency mechanism, which for the purposes of Articles 64 and 65 GDPR, is administered by the Chair. Docksey clarifies that while some tasks of the Chair are purely administrative or procedural, [ 3 ] other consistency mechanism tasks are more substantive. [ 4 ] For example, the Chair may determine a \u201c reasonable \u201d period in which members may object to draft decisions (Article 64(3) GDPR). Together with the other supervisory authorities, the Chair has also the right to request an opinion of the EDPB on any matter of general application or producing effects in more than one Member State (Article 64(2) GDPR). Docksey notes that the \u201c subject-matter is thus not limited to the matters listed in Article 64(1) and could concern, for example, the determination of a data breach or the validity of consent in a specific technological context [\u2026]\u201d. [ 5 ] Article 74(2) GDPR allows for the Board to determine the allocation of tasks between the Chair and the deputy chairs in its Rules of Procedure (\u201c RoP \u201d). [ 6 ] Article 7(2) RoP provides that after each election of the Chair and, or deputy chairs, the Chair shall, after consultation with the deputy chairs, submit a proposal to the Board for the allocation of tasks among them including the acting on behalf of each other in cases of non-availability or incapacity.

The staff of the European Data Protection Supervisor involved in carrying out the tasks conferred on the Board by this Regulation shall be subject to separate reporting lines from the staff involved in carrying out tasks conferred on the European Data Protection Supervisor. 4.   Where appropriate, the Board and the European Data Protection Supervisor shall establish and publish a Memorandum of Understanding implementing this Article, determining the terms of their cooperation, and applicable to the staff of the European Data Protection Supervisor involved in carrying out the tasks conferred on the Board by this Regulation. 5.   The secretariat shall provide analytical, administrative and logistical support to the Board. 6.   The secretariat shall be responsible in particular for: Article 75 GDPR establishes the existence of, and governs the functioning of the secretariat of the Board. Article 75 GDPR outlines the secretariat's responsibilities, which take on a primarily administrative function. Including the secretariat within the GDPR's legislative rubric is reflective of European policymakers' desire to support the Board with robust administrative assistance in pursuit of maintaining the Board's independent functioning. [ 1 ] Article 75(1) GDPR clarifies that the EDPB secretariat is provided for by the EDPS. Docksey notes that the choice of the EDPS rather than the Commission to provide the secretariat was based on the following factors. Unlike the Commission, the EDPS is itself an independent supervisory authority, has its own financial budget, independent administration and has the necessary data protection knowledge. Furthermore, this choice must be seen in light of Case C-614/10, Commission v Austria . Here, the ECJ established that a supervisory authority's staff could not be subject to the disciplinary oversight of the executive. The Court noted that this arrangement undermined the authority's independence by creating the risks of partiality and undue influence. [ 2 ] Docksey suggests that the ruling in Case C-614/10 \"made it plain,\" that under no circumstances could the Board be reliant on the Commission for its functioning, therefore its reliance on the EDPS as an independent authority was the most logical conclusion. [ 3 ] The second paragraph of the provision clarifies that the secretariat is subject to the instructions of the Board's Chair. The use of the word \u201c exclusively \u201d is intended to clarify that the EDPS does not retain any authority over the staff seconded to the EDPB. [ 4 ] Many commentators doubt that Article 75(1) GDPR can effectively ensure EDPB freedom from any influence from the EDPS, direct or indirect. For instance, the secretariat staff remain formally employed by the EDPS and are only made available to the EDPB on a temporary basis. Finally secretariat staff are dependent on the EDPS for career progression. [ 5 ] This arrangement undoubtedly has the capacity to undermine the Board's independence and may conflict with the legislative aim of establishing an independent Board. Whether Article 75(1) GDPR can truly ensure the secretariat's freedom from the EDPS' influence, remains to be seen. However, it must be acknowledged that this risk is offset by the reporting provisions under Article 75(3) GDPR. The employees of the Board's secretariat only report to the Chair (Recital 140 GDPR). In this respect, they are therefore withdrawn from the EDPS\u2019s oversight (Article 46 Regulation (EC) No. 45/2001) and are obliged to maintain secrecy vis-\u00e0-vis their employer with regard to their activities within the EDPB. The EDPB's interdependence upon the EDPS gave rise to concerns regarding the Board's independence. These concerns have been acknowledged and are reflected in the legislature's need to ensure a special status for members of the secretariat in terms of staff selection, leave, performance appraisals, disciplinary profiles, reintegration into the EDPS ranks, and separate reporting lines. To this end, as suggested by Article 75(4) GDPR, the EDPS and the EDPB issued a joint Memorandum of Understanding on May 25, 2018 (\u201c MoU \u201d) which also defines the terms of the EDPS/EDPB cooperation with regard to organisation of work spaces and structures (service rooms, e-mail addresses, filing systems and separation of documents). [ 6 ] Brink and Wilhelm have rightly doubted the extent to which the MoU will be able to prevent any potential interference from the EDPS in the Board's staffing and budgetary arrangements. [ 7 ] The secretariat of the EDPB has a broader range of tasks than the simple administrative and logistical tasks provided by the Commission secretariat to the Article 29 Working Party. Article 75(5) GDPR states generally that the secretariat shall provide \u201c analytical, administrative and logistical support \u201d. This broadly requires the secretariat to carry out two different types of activity for the Board: analytical tasks on the one hand, and logistical and administrative tasks on the other. [ 8 ] These are explained further below. Article 75(6) GDPR exhaustively lists the secretariat's tasks. The Board's administrative and logistical tasks include responsibilities such as (a) the day-to-day business of the Board; (b) communication between the members of the Board, its Chair and the Commission, and, where relevant, the EFTA Surveillance Authority; (d) the use of electronic means for the internal and external communication; and (e) the translation of relevant information. [ 9 ] While the secretariat's analytical tasks include (c) communicating with other institutions and the public; (f) the preparation and follow-up of the meetings of the Board; and (g) the preparation, drafting and publication of opinions, decisions on the settlement of disputes between supervisory authorities and other texts adopted by the Board.

Where Necessary 3.1.1 Confidentiality in the EDPB Rules of Procedure. 3.2 (2) Access to Documents 3.1 (1) Confidentiality, Where Necessary 3.1.1 Confidentiality in the EDPB Rules of Procedure. 3.1.1 Confidentiality in the EDPB Rules of Procedure. 3.2 (2) Access to Documents 4 Decisions 5 References 1.   The discussions of the Board shall be confidential where the Board deems it necessary, as provided for in its rules of procedure. 2.   Access to documents submitted to members of the Board, experts and representatives of third parties shall be governed by Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (21). Article 76 GDPR subjects the Board's discussions to confidentiality, only in circumstances where the Board deems it necessary. [ 1 ] The deliberations of the Board's predecessor, the Article 29 Working Party (\u201c WP29 \u201d), were wholly privileged. Under Article 11(1) of WP29's Rules of Procedure, any minutes and draft documents were confidential, except in circumstances where the WP29 decided to make any such information public. [ 2 ] European legislators thought it necessary to provide for a more transparent approach in regards to the EDPB. Article 42 of the  Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (\" CFR \") and Article 15(3)  Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\" TFEU \") establish a right of transparency, ensuring the public accessibility of documents. In respect of these provisions, Article 76 GDPR reverses the confidentiality rules applicable to the WP29. The Regulation establishes that for the EDPB, transparency regarding deliberations is to be the norm, except in instances where confidentiality is warranted. [ 3 ] The provision presents an insight into how the Regulation attempts to balance different interests at stake. On the one hand, European authorities must act transparently to ensure accountability is maintained - and to ensure compliance with the wider institutional legal framework. While on the other hand, a space of confidentiality must be preserved to allow them to act effectively. The wording of Article 76(1) GDPR makes it clear that the Board's deliberations are only to be confidential in exceptional circumstances, where the Board considers that confidentiality is specifically required. Consequently, the general norm is that the Board's discussions are to be publicly accessible unless it is necessary to impose secrecy on them. In turn, the criteria for defining cases of secrecy are laid down in the EDPB's Rules of Procedure (\u201c RoP \u201d). Article 33(1) RoP stipulates that in \u201c accordance with Art 76 (1) GDPR \u201d, discussions of the Board and of expert subgroups shall be confidential when: \u201c a. they concern a specific individual; b. they concern the consistency mechanism; c. the Board decides that the discussions on a specific topic shall remain confidential for instance when the discussions concern international relations and/or where the absence of confidentiality would seriously undermine the institution's decision-making process, unless there is an overriding public interest in disclosure. \u201d Article 76(2) GDPR provides that access to documents submitted to members of the EDPB, experts and representatives of third parties shall be governed by Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 which lays down the general principles and limits to public access of Union documents. The scope of what falls under Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 is fairly broad. Article 2(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 provides that documents which fall under its scope are any \u201c documents drawn up or received by it [Union bodies] . \u201d In this regard, Article 76(2) GDPR significantly reduces the scope of the access only to \u201c documents submitted to members of the Board, experts and representatives of third parties \u201d. It follows that documents drawn up by the EDPB itself are not included in the right of access unless other more specific provisions of the GDPR apply, only documents received by the Board fall under the governance of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001. More specific provisions include Articles 64(5)(b), 65(5), 70(3) and 70(4) GDPR, which regulate the publication of opinions and resolutions of the Board. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 76 GDPR \u2191 Dix , in K\u00fchling, Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 76 GDPR, margin number 1 (C.H.

[ 1 ] Many SAs provide forms that ensure that a complainant includes all relevant information as suggested in the last sentence of Recital 141 GDPR. Under Article 77(1) GDPR, every data subject shall have the right to lodge a complaint with a SA, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement, if the data subject considers that the processing of personal data relating to them infringes the GDPR. The right to file a complaint under Article 77(1) does not limit any other administrative or judicial remedies available. For instance, a data subject can still initiate legal proceedings against a controller or processor (as per Article 79 GDPR) irrespective of whether a complaint has been lodged with a supervisory authority, either concurrently or independently. [ 2 ] Lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority does not impact the eligibility or validity of other remedies. CJEU : The CJEU has clarified in C-132/21 that \" Article 77(1), Article 78(1) and Article 79(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 [...] must be interpreted as permitting the remedies provided for in Article 77(1) and Article 78(1) of that regulation, on the one hand, and Article 79(1) thereof, on the other, to be exercised concurrently with and independently of each other. It is for the Member States, in accordance with the principle of procedural autonomy, to lay down detailed rules as regards the relationship between those remedies in order to ensure the effective protection of the rights guaranteed by that regulation and the consistent and homogeneous application of its provisions, as well as the right to an effective remedy before a court or tribunal as referred to in Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. \" [ 3 ] The decision of whether to choose the complaint procedure or another remedy lies with the affected individual and may be influenced by practicality or efficiency aspects, in addition to legal considerations. Some of these aspects may be, legal costs, procedural expediency, the presence or absence of procedural rights including the right to be heard throughout the proceedings. Another reason to file a complaint with the SA instead of using another legal remedy could be the intention to make the DPA aware of specific GDPR infringements, since complaints are an important medium for SAs to learn of and observe data protection practices. \"Complaints under Article 77(1) of the GDPR play an important role in terms of the supervisory authorities\u2019 awareness of infringements of the rights protected by that regulation. Those complaints therefore contribute significantly to ensuring a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons within the European Union and to strengthening and setting out in detail the rights of those persons within the meaning of recitals 10 and 11 of that regulation.\" CJEU - C\u2011416/23 - \u00d6sterreichische Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rde , margin number 53. It should also be noted that the data subject's right to complaint does not preclude the national legislator to implement provisions enabling competitors of a controller to challenge GDPR infringements in court as prohibited unfair commercial practices. [ 4 ] The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grants data subjects the right to file a \" complaint \" with a supervisory authority. Contrary to what some scholars argue, we do not believe that this right amounts to a mere \" petition \" to the authority, leaving it to act or not according to its own priorities. Beyond the literal wording (the law speaks of a \" complaint \" not a \" petition \"), there are several elements  suggesting that a complaint obliges the authority to take action and make a decision on the specific issues raised by the complainant. To begin with, the protection of personal data is a fundamental right of the individual, and the right to a favorable decision through a complaint is one of the fundamental elements to ensure such protection. Scattered throughout the GDPR are numerous elements supporting this interpretation. To cite a few, Article 57(1)(f) requires that the supervisory authority \" handle complaints lodged by a data subject ,\" \" investigate, to the extent appropriate, the subject matter of the complaint \" and \" inform the complainant of the progress and the outcome of the investigation within a reasonable period. \" The letter of the law is clear. Once any complaint is received, the supervisory authority must take action to reach a decision, of any kind, even if it is ultimately a rejection. Article 60(9) GDPR points towards the same conclusion when it considers the possibility that \" parts \" of the complaint may be acted upon while others can be \" dismissed .\" The complaint under Article 77 GDPR is not a mere \"petition\" that the supervisory authority can freely consider and manage at its discretion. Otherwise, the provisions of Article 78(1) and (2) of the GDPR would not make much sense. These articles guarantee the data subject an effective judicial remedy not only against a decision by the SA (Article 78(1) GDPR) but also in cases where the supervisory authority does not handle the case or otherwise issue any formal decision (Article 78(2) GDPR). The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) openly confirms this interpretation in an internal document later published on its website, stating that \" for all admitted complaints that are not withdrawn, supervisory authorities must provide an outcome specifying the facts and legal considerations for, e.g., rejecting the complaint or dismissing the complaint, i.e., not investigating it further, with a view to make it a legally attackable act .\" [ 5 ] The meaning of the term 'complaint' is not defined by Article 77, nor by the GDPR in general. Given the lack of a strict legal definition, this word must necessarily be interpreted in a broad way, with the only exclusion of those cases where a data subject is not lamenting any negative situation specifically affecting him or her. In terms of object, the content of a complaint is not restricted to the 'rights of the data subject' that form the object of Chapter 3 of the GDPR. [ 6 ] It follows from this very broad notion of complaint that the GDPR does not impose any particular form requirement, either. Additional elements may be imposed by national law in light of the principle of procedural autonomy of the Member States - especially for reasons of consistency with national administrative systems and provided that effectiveness of the EU law is not impaired. However, from a purely European perspective, the only requirements that can be inferred by the GDPR are those who qualify the request as a complaint, namely the identity of the complainant, a minimal description of the facts giving rise to the violation and what the data subject expects from the authority. Reference to legal provisions is not mandatory, as the data subject may be not knowledgeable about the law and its technicalities. In theory, the controller could also be omitted, especially whenever the data subject does not know its identity. However, to specify the name of the latter may be necessary for the SA to understand the complaint and act on it. In this case, the name of the controller must also be provided. With regard to the modalities of the lodging, Article 57(2) GDPR imposes a duty of facilitation stating that the SAs shall provide for both electronic and 'traditional' means to lodge complaints. The idea that prior interaction with the controller is a necessary requirement for the lodging of a complaint with the SA does not find any confirmation in the text of the GDPR. In practice, this interaction may be often required by the nature of the complaint, such as in an unanswered access or erasure request. However, outside these cases and as long as a similar requirement is not established at the national level, a SA has no power to dismiss a complaint on the only basis that the data subject did not reach out to the controller in the first place. It has to be stressed that the lodging itself does not preclude further communications between data subject and controller, nor the possibility to close the case in an amicable way. Concerning the time for the lodging of a complaint, the GDPR does not establish any particular limitation. However, some Member States have established deadlines, starting e.g. from the moment when the violation became known to the data subject. [ 7 ] Also this element can be read in light of the principle of procedural autonomy. The provision requires that a complaint can be filed when the \" data subject considers that the processing of personal data relating to him or her infringes the Regulation .\" From this perspective, the essential conditions are two. First, there must be a processing of personal data relating to a specific individual. Second, the processing must infringe the GDPR. The controller, joint controller, or processor must have processed the personal data of the data subject. Consequently, if no data processing has ever occurred, there is obviously no basis for filing a complaint. However, this interpretation should not lead to extreme outcomes. First and foremost, by virtue of the favor granted to them for submitting the complaint, it is not required for the data subject to provide an objective and robust demonstration of the ongoing processing. The case must certainly be contextualized, allowing the Supervisory Authority (SA) to initiate, if deemed necessary, the appropriate investigations. In any event, the level of detail required for substantiation is unquestionably lower compared to what is stipulated in civil procedures, as it is incumbent upon the SA to develop its own legal assessment. [ 8 ] Moreover, there are certain situations where, even in the absence of data processing, a complaint may still seem justifiable, avoiding systematically unacceptable interpretations. First, consider, for example, the case of the privacy policy under Article 13 of the GDPR. This information is typically provided before the data processing begins, and yet, there is no doubt that the right to information under Article 13 is a fundamental right and a violation of it can be subject to a complaint to the supervisory authority. Second, a similar situation arises with Article 15(1) of the GDPR, which grants the data subject the right to obtain \" from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed .\" If the controller fails to respond to such a request, a clear violation of the GDPR occurs. Once again, there is no doubt that the data subject can file a complaint under Article 77 of the GDPR, simply due to not having received such a response, regardless of whether any personal data processing has actually taken place or is ongoing. Third, another scenario is when a controller, upon being informed of the data subject's intention to take legal action for unlawful data processing, intentionally deletes the data to avoid potential liabilities, thus violating Article 17(3)(e) of the GDPR. In this case, indeed, no ongoing data processing exists, and a strict application of Article 77 would lead to the complaint being deemed inadmissible. However, once again, such a conclusion would be entirely unacceptable. Hence, in general terms, a complaint under Article 77 is only admissible when there is ongoing processing of personal data related to the complainant. No hard evidence about this shall be provided by the data subject. Nevertheless, in certain situations specifically foreseen in the law (\" lex specialis \"), the complaint remains admissible even if no processing occurred. The data subject must at least allege that their data is processed in violation of the GDPR. Contrary to the prevailing opinion among legal scholars, [ 9 ] some SAs have taken the stance that the right to lodge a complaint is limited to violations of data subject rights under Chapter III of the GDPR (\u201c Rights of the data subject \u201c). [ 10 ] For the following reasons, the academic opinion provides the more compelling arguments. First, the language of Article 77(1) GDPR does not contain any limitations to violations of Chapter III rights. Second, Article 8(2) Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU (\u201c CFR \u201d) already foresees that personal data \u201c must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law. \u201d These requirements are laid down in detail in Articles 5 to 10 GDPR. In light of Article 41 and Article 47 CFR, limiting complaints to the violation of Chapter III GDPR would therefore violate not only the GDPR but also primary EU law. Third, a limitation to violations of Chapter III rights would also result in massive enforcement deficiencies. A data subject would have no possibility to have certain processing activities reviewed by a SA. For example, a processing activity that is based on an algorithm that produces incorrect data on a regular basis could not be addressed under Article 16 GDPR as Article 16 GDPR can only be invoked to rectify existing inaccurate data but not to stop the ongoing creation of incorrect data that is based on existing correct data. In this case, the data subject would have to rely directly on the principle of accuracy under Article 5(1)(d) GDPR in conjunction with Articles 24 and 25 GDPR and ask the SA to order the controller to bring the processing operation into compliance with the GDPR under Article 58(2)(d) GDPR or even ban it under Article 58(2)(f) GDPR. Therefore, complaints under Article 77 GDPR should extend to a broad range of violations concerning, inter alia : the principles of data processing ( Article 5 GDPR ), the lawfulness of processing ( Articles 6 , 9 and 10 GDPR ), the conditions for consent ( Articles 7 and 8 GDPR ), information under Article 11(2) GDPR , provisions of Chapter III of the GDPR ( Articles 12 to 22 GDPR ), the duty to communicate a personal data breach to the data subject ( Article 34 GDPR ), the provisions on data transfers to third countries or international organisations under Chapter V of the GDPR ( Article 44 et seq. GDPR). [ 11 ] The GDPR only requires that a SA is addressed by the complaint. This general rule is only limited by a non-exhaustive list of possible SAs. This means that a complainant may file a complaint with any SA in the European Economic Area, independent of location. [ 12 ] The most common place to lodge a complaint is the home jurisdiction of the complainant. The habitual residence is defined in different EU laws and requires a legal right to residence and an objective assessment of the factual residence. Especially in cross border cases, data subjects might want to choose to lodge complaints at the place of their habitual residence, as this allows for the data subject to file the complaint in (one of) the official languages of the relevant Member State, rather than the official language of the Member State that the controller is based in. Similar to the habitual residence, complainants can lodge a complaint before the SA of their work place. It is not required that the complaint has any connection to the place of work. The complaint can also be lodged before the SA of the place of the alleged infringement. This clause is a typical form of jurisdiction that is aimed at aligning the location of the decision maker with the location of facts. Example: The SA that is closest to a CCTV camera may be best placed to gather factual evidence on the CCTV system, without the need to request mutual assistance from other SAs. The option to lodge a complaint with any SA does not mean that the SA with which the case has been lodged necessarily decides about the case. Which SA actually handles the case is subject to Article 55 and 56 GDPR . In any case the SA with which the complaint has been lodged remains a \u201c supervisory authority concerned \u201d under Article 4(22)(c) GDPR and the point of contact for the data subject (\u201c one-stop shop \u201d). Under Article 77(2) GDPR, \u201c the supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged shall inform the complainant on the progress and the outcome of the complaint including the possibility of a judicial remedy pursuant to Article 78. \u201d This provision only addresses the SA with which the complaint has been lodged but not the SA ultimately handling the case under Articles 55 and 56 GDPR (which might be the same or a different SA). The SA\u2019s report on the progress as well as the final decision must include information on the possibility for a judicial remedy under Article 78(2) GDPR and Article 78(1) GDPR respectively. Article 77(2) GDPR does not stipulate a deadline by which the data subject has to be initially informed about the progress of the complaint, nor does it contain rules on the frequency of such \u201c progress reports \u201d. Read in conjunction with Article 57(1)(f) GDPR (\u201c[\u2026] inform the complainant of the progress and the outcome of the investigation within a reasonable period, [\u2026]\u201d) , the SA must inform the data subject within a reasonable period. Moreover, under Article 78(2) GDPR , a data subject has the right to an effective judicial remedy where the SA that is competent pursuant to Article 55 and 56 GDPR does not inform the data subject within three months on the progress or outcome of the complaint lodged pursuant to Article 77 GDPR. It must be noted that other than Article 77(2) GDPR, Article 78(2) does not address the SA with which the complaint has been lodged but rather the SA that is competent to handle the case under Articles 55 and 56 GDPR . Thus, if the SA with which the complaint has been lodged is also competent to handle the case under Article 55 GDPR , the SA has to inform the data subject within three months after receipt of the complaint on its progress or outcome under Article 78(2) GDPR . Vice versa , if the SA with which the complaint has been lodged is not competent to handle the case (but rather the lead SA under Article 56 is), then the SA with which the complaint has been lodged must inform the data subject under Article 77(2) GDPR. The first information usually is an acknowledgement of receipt and a notice that the case has been forwarded to an (alleged) lead LSA. Although there is no specific deadline for this information, the three-month period of Article 78(2) GDPR should be applied per analogiam. As soon as the lead SA is established (which very often takes longer than three months), it must inform the data subject within three months after receipt of the complaint on its progress or outcome under Article 78(2) GDPR. For practical reasons, the SA with which the complaint has been lodged usually informs the data subject on behalf of the lead SA on this. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 77 GDPR \u2191 Bergt , in K\u00fchling, Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 77 GDPR, margin number 26 (C.H.

Decisions 5 References 1. \u00a0 Without prejudice to any other administrative or non-judicial remedy, each natural or legal person shall have the right to an effective judicial remedy against a legally binding decision of a supervisory authority concerning them. 2. \u00a0 Without prejudice to any other administrative or non-judicial remedy, each data subject shall have the right to a an effective judicial remedy where the supervisory authority which is competent pursuant to Articles 55 and 56 does not handle a complaint or does not inform the data subject within three months on the progress or outcome of the complaint lodged pursuant to Article 77. 3. \u00a0 Proceedings against a supervisory authority shall be brought before the courts of the Member State where the supervisory authority is established. 4. \u00a0 Where proceedings are brought against a decision of a supervisory authority which was preceded by an opinion or a decision of the Board in the consistency mechanism, the supervisory authority shall forward that opinion or decision to the court. Any natural or legal person has the right to bring an action for annulment of decisions of the Board before the Court of Justice under the conditions provided for in Article 263 TFEU. As addressees of such decisions, the supervisory authorities concerned which wish to challenge them have to bring action within two months of being notified of them, in accordance with Article 263 TFEU. Where decisions of the Board are of direct and individual concern to a controller, processor or complainant, the latter may bring an action for annulment against those decisions within two months of their publication on the website of the Board, in accordance with Article 263 TFEU. Without prejudice to this right under Article 263 TFEU, each natural or legal person should have an effective judicial remedy before the competent national court against a decision of a supervisory authority which produces legal effects concerning that person. Such a decision concerns in particular the exercise of investigative, corrective and authorisation powers by the supervisory authority or the dismissal or rejection of complaints. However, the right to an effective judicial remedy does not encompass measures taken by supervisory authorities which are not legally binding, such as opinions issued by or advice provided by the supervisory authority. Proceedings against a supervisory authority should be brought before the courts of the Member State where the supervisory authority is established and should be conducted in accordance with that Member State's procedural law. Those courts should exercise full jurisdiction, which should include jurisdiction to examine all questions of fact and law relevant to the dispute before them. Article 78 GDPR, titled \" Right to an effective judicial remedy against a supervisory authority \", embodies the general principle of judicial protection against actions or omissions by public authorities in general, and in particular, guarantees a right of judicial review against the decisions of data protection authorities. This approach, in line with Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union  (\" CFR \"), ultimately assigns the role of \" guardians of the EU legal order \" to the judiciary. [ 1 ] In essence, Article\u00a078(1)\u00a0GDPR recognises an effective judicial remedy for anyone affected by a binding decision of the supervisory authority (\" SA\" ). Paragraph 2 of the provision guarantees the same remedy to data subjects in cases of inactivity by a supervisory authority, following the submission of a complaint under Article 77. Paragraph 3 clarifies that these proceedings must be initiated in the jurisdiction where the supervisory authority is established. Finally, paragraph 4 obligates the supervisory authority to inform the court seized of the matter when the challenged decision is the result of a binding decision by the European Data Protection Board (\" EDPB \"). Article 78(1) GDPR grants natural and legal persons the right to a judicial remedy against a \"legally binding decision\" of a supervisory authority. Therefore, the legal system establishes an additional avenue of protection in cases where the supervisory authority, through its decision, fails to correctly apply or infringes the GDPR or any other applicable laws, including national ones. See commentary under Article 77 GDPR . Equally, the existence of the right to an effective judicial remedy against a controller or processor in accordance with Article 79(1) GDPR does not affect the right to an effective judicial remedy under Article 78(1) GDPR. \"[...] the existence of the right to an effective judicial remedy against a controller or processor, provided for in Article 79(1) of the GDPR, does not affect the scope of the judicial review exercised, in the context of an action brought under Article 78(1) of that regulation, over a decision on a complaint adopted by a supervisory authority.\" CJEU - Joined Cases C\u201126/22 and C\u201164/22 - SCHUFA , margin number 67.. Article 78(1) GDPR establishes both natural and legal persons as potential claimants for legal actions against a SA decision. A natural person under that provision is usually a data subject (see Article 4(1) GDPR), although it is also possible that a controller or processor is a natural person. A legal person would usually be the controller or processor with regard to a certain processing activity, or a legal entity that is otherwise bound by a SA decision. The term \u201c legal person \u201d also encompasses other public authorities/bodies, as SAs can issue decisions with legal effect on such entities. [ 2 ] The natural or legal person must be concerned by the SA decision. This requirement is the case if the natural or legal person (i) has been a party to the proceedings before the SA, either as a complainant or respondent, (ii) has been subject to ex-officio investigations by the SA, (iii) has been fined under Article 83 GDPR or (iv) is subject to a penalty under Article 84 GDPR. If a data subject\u2019s personal data is otherwise affected by the SA decision, for example in case of a data breach in which the data subject\u2019s data was disclosed, they are also concerned by the SA decision. Bergt argues that a data subject could even bring a legal action if a SA rejects the complaint of another data subject on the general illegitimacy of a certain processing activity that also affects the data subject. [ 3 ] A controller or processor is also concerned by a SA decision that addresses a third party or does not have an addressee, but has a legally binding general effect. [ 4 ] For instance, an example of this would be a SA\u2019s orders regarding withdrawal or non-issuing of certifications under Articles 58(2)(h), 42 and 43 GDPR. [ 5 ] The point of consideration is certainly one of the most relevant aspects of the entire provision. An individual affected by the decision has the right to an effective judicial remedy. However, what makes this remedy \" effective \"? In general terms, an \" effective \" remedy should either halt the alleged violation or its ongoing occurrence, or offer suitable remedy for any violation that has already taken place. Recital 143 of the GDPR specifies that that the courts seized of the matter \" should exercise full jurisdiction, which should include jurisdiction to examine all questions of fact and law relevant to the dispute before them .\" Therefore, in order for a remedy to be effective, the court seised of an action against a decision of a SA has to be competent to examine all questions of fact and law relevant to the dispute before them. [ 6 ] \"Thus, [\u2026] it follows from Article 78(1) of the GDPR, read in the light of recital 143 of that regulation, that courts seised of an action against a decision of a supervisory authority should exercise full jurisdiction, which should include jurisdiction to examine all questions of fact and law relevant to the dispute before them [\u2026] Therefore, Article 78(1) of the GDPR cannot be interpreted as meaning that judicial review of a decision on a complaint taken by a supervisory authority is limited to the question of whether the authority has handled the complaint, investigated the subject matter of the complaint to the extent appropriate and informed the complainant of the outcome of the investigation. On the contrary, for a judicial remedy to be \u2018effective\u2019, as required by that provision, such a decision must be subject to full judicial review.\" CJEU - Joined Cases C\u201126/22 and C\u201164/22 - SCHUFA , margin number 52 et seq.. Considering the extensive investigative and corrective powers of the SA (see commentary on Article 58 GDPR ) it would not meet the requirements of an effective judicial remedy if decisions concerning the exercise of these powers were subject only to limited judicial review. [ 7 ] The CJEU already emphasised that the fact that decisions by SAs are subject to full judicial review does not call into question the SAs' guarantee of independence. [ 8 ] At the same time the full judicial review by court does not mean that the SA does not enjoy a certain degree of discretion regarding the usage of its powers (see commentary on Article 58 GDPR ). Therefore, the the right to an effective judicial remedy does not mean that the court seised can just substitute its assessment for that of that SA, but requires that the court examines whether the SA has complied with the limits of its discretion. [ 9 ] More information as to what \" effective \" means can be found in the CJEU's case-law regarding Article 47 CFR. The case-law includes statutory rules about appointment of the judges, length of service and the grounds for abstention, rejection and dismissal of its members, permanence in functioning, organizational independence from all parties of a dispute, impartiality and competence in adjudication. Only when all of the above mentioned standards are fulfilled it is possible to evaluate a state power as a court. Finally, a remedy is considered effective when an individual has the genuine opportunity to protect their rights and make their arguments in a specific case. On this point, the European Court of Human Rights has clarified that \" individuals concerned must receive sufficient information concerning their situations to be able to make use of the appropriate remedies and to substantiate their complaints, and to have access to interpreters and legal assistance .\" [ 10 ] This principle plays a major role in cases where a SA adopts a decision concerning the controller/processor and 'notifies' the data subject without any specific remark regarding the issues raised in the complaint. In this case the data subject should be granted access to the entire administrative file. Otherwise, it would be challenging to conceive of an \" effective \" judicial remedy, as the appellant would be forced into a defence in the dark, so to speak. Case-law : This conclusion can also be drawn from the CJEU case law, which identifies a violation of the right to a fair hearing (Article 47 of the Charter) \" where a judicial decision is founded on facts and documents which the parties, or one of them, have not had an opportunity to examine and on which they have therefore been unable to comment .\" [ 11 ] Article 78(1) GDPR only allows for remedies against legally binding decisions. [ 12 ] These include SA decisions on complaints made under Article\u00a077\u00a0GDPR; decisions following the exercise of a SA's investigative powers under Articles 58(1)(a), (b), (c), (e) and (f) GDPR; decisions following the exercise of a SA's corrective powers under Article 58(2) GDPR; decisions on the approval of certain legal acts, bodies or processing activities under Article 58(3)(c)-(j) GDPR; and decisions following the exercise of powers vested in the SA by Member State law under Article 58(6) GDPR. Mere notifications, opinions or advisory acts, such as under Articles 58(1)(d) or 58(3)(a) and 58(3)(b) GDPR do not qualify as decisions and cannot be subject to legal actions under Article 78(1) GDPR. [ 13 ] Example : After examining the merits of a complaint longed with it, the SA found a processing activity to be lawful under the GDPR. This rejection of the complaint by the SA constitutes a legally binding decision which produces legal effects with regard to the complainant. Therefore, the complainant has has the right to an effective judicial remedy against this decision. [ 14 ] A data subject has the right to an effective judicial remedy, [ 15 ] where the competent SA under Articles 55 and 56 GDPR (i) does not handle a complaint or (ii) fails to inform the data subject within three months on the progress or outcome of a complaint. [ 16 ] The data subject has the right to an effective judicial remedy if the SA does not handle the complaint. The GDPR contains no definition of what constitutes the \u201c[non] handling \u201d of a complaint, although the language can be found in other parts of the GDPR. To begin with,  Recital 141 GDPR clarifies that an SA must \u201c act on a complaint \u201d. [ 17 ] Article 57(1)(f) GDPR, in turns, establishes that the SA has to \u201c handle complaints lodged by a data subject [\u2026], and investigate, to the extent appropriate, the subject matter of the complaint [\u2026]\u201d. The use of the conjunction \" and [investigate]\" indicates that the \" handling \" of the complaint must involve an investigative activity, understood as the process of ascertaining the facts. This phrasing does not mean that the SA must always undertake complex investigative activities. Sometimes, to address the complaint, it will be sufficient to verify whether a privacy policy complies with the requirements specified in Article 13 GDPR. Similarly, in the case of cookie banners, it should be ensured that the user dialogue window contains all the necessary elements to render consent valid under the GDPR. In turn, the investigative activity, whether simple or complex, must lead to the adoption of a final decision that can be challenged under Article 78(1) GDPR. Again, Article 57(1)(f) GDPR is instructive regarding the SA's obligation \"[to reach] the outcome of the investigation within a reasonable period \".  The EDPB confirms that the investigation must have an \" outcome ,\" and such an \" outcome \" must specify \" the facts and legal considerations for, e.g., rejecting the complaint or dismissing the complaint, i.e., not investigating it further, with a view to make it a legally attackable act .\" [ 18 ] In other words, what is necessary for the handling of a complaint is not only an investigation, but also the adoption of a legally challengeable act, being the latter a decision in the merits or just a procedural dismissal. It may also be that the case is settled between the parties and, or the data subject withdraws the complaint. In those cases there is no room to claim that the SA did not handle the complaint, as the complaint ceased to exist. Finally, a SA cannot take an indefinite amount of time to decide on the merits of the case. In light of the principle of effectiveness under Article 4(3) of the Treaty on the European Union (\" TEU \"), Articles 8, 41 and 47 CFR, and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (\" ECHR \"), the SA must issue a decision within a reasonable time. Some Member States foresee decision periods in their national law. [ 19 ] Article 78(2) GDPR also provides for a remedy where a SA fails to inform the data subject on the progress or outcome of the complaint lodged pursuant to Article 77 GDPR. The SA with which the complaint has been lodged has a duty to inform the data subject under Article 77(2) GDPR but not under Article 78(2) GDPR \u2013 unless it is also competent to handle the case under Article 55 or 56 GDPR. Taking into account of the fourth sentence of Recital 141 GDPR, the SA must provide the information at least every three months (\u201c If the case requires further investigation or coordination with another supervisory authority, intermediate information should be given to the data subject \u201d). Consequently, if a SA manages to decide on a complaint within three months or less, it must only inform the data subject on the outcome of the complaint procedure. Should the procedure take longer, the SA must proactively provide an update on the state of play every three months. If the SA fails to do so, it can be subject to legal actions under Article\u00a078(2) GDPR. Under Article 78(3) GDPR, proceedings against a SA shall be brought before the courts of the Member State where the SA is established. The procedural details of such judicial remedies are subject to Member State law. [ 20 ] It is up to Member State law to foresee which national court is competent. In some Member States, civil courts are competent for legal remedies under Article\u00a078\u00a0GDPR, in other Member States administrative courts have jurisdiction. Article 78(1) GDPR requires an effective judicial remedy \u2013 a term already used in Article 47(1) CFR. Hence, a Member State's law must not impose inappropriate restrictions that hinder the effectiveness of a remedy under Article 78 GDPR (such as very short deadlines to appeal a SA\u2019s decision under Article 78(2) GDPR). [ 21 ] These remedies do not necessarily have to be free of charge, as Article\u00a057(3)\u00a0GDPR only concerns the performance of the tasks of SAs. However, imposing inadequately high court fees on the claimant \u2013 especially if they are a data subject \u2013 may violate primary EU law, namely Article 47 CFR in connection with Article 16 TFEU and Article 8 CFR. In Joined Cases E-11/19 and E-12/1, the EFTA Court held that there are cases in which proceedings under Article 78(1) GDPR that were not initiated by the data subject must be free of charge for the data subject: \u201c It follows from Articles77(1) and 57(3) of Regulation(EU) 2016/679 that where a data subject becomes a party to proceedings under Article 78(1) as a result of a data controller appealing against a supervisory authority\u2019s decision, and where national law imposes this status on a data subject automatically, the data subject may not be made responsible for any costs incurred in relation to those proceedings .\" [ 22 ] If a legal remedy under Article 78(1) GDPR is filed against a SA decision that was preceded by an opinion or a decision of the EDPB in the consistency mechanism (Articles 63 et seq. GDPR), the SA must forward that opinion or decision to the court that is handling the case. This provision ensures that the court does not ignore the EDPB\u2019s opinion or decision when assessing the case. As a national court lacks the competence to waive a decision by the EDPB, if it considers the EDPB\u2019s decision invalid (Recital 143 sentence 11 GDPR), it must request a preliminary ruling from  the CJEU under Article\u00a0267\u00a0TFEU. However, the court may not refer a question on the validity of the EDPB decision at the request of a natural or legal person, which had missed the opportunity to bring an action for annulment of the EDPB decision under Article 263 TFEU.

Such difference should not be disregarded.

The local SA does not inform the data subject within three months on the progress or outcome of the complaint.

The LSA does not inform the data subject within three months on the progress or outcome of the complaint. \u2191 Recital 141 GDPR: \u201c Every data subject should have [\u2026] the right to an effective judicial remedy in accordance with Article 47 of the Charter [\u2026] where the supervisory authority does not act on a complaint, partially or wholly rejects or dismisses a complaint or does not act where such action is necessary to protect the rights of the data subject.

Regulation 4 Decisions 5 References 1. \u00a0Without prejudice to any available administrative or non-judicial remedy, including the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority pursuant to Article 77, each data subject shall have the right to an effective judicial remedy where he or she considers that his or her rights under this Regulation have been infringed as a result of the processing of his or her personal data in non-compliance with this Regulation. 2. \u00a0Proceedings against a controller or a processor shall be brought before the courts of the Member State where the controller or processor has an establishment. Alternatively, such proceedings may be brought before the courts of the Member State where the data subject has his or her habitual residence, unless the controller or processor is a public authority of a Member State acting in the exercise of its public powers. Article 79 GDPR establishes the data subject right to an effective judicial remedy against a controller or processor. This Article finds its roots in Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (\u2018 CFR \u2019), which asserts the 'right to an effective remedy before a tribunal' . Article 77 GDPR , which notes the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (' SA' ), does not constitute an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 47 CFR, as SAs are categorised as administrative not judicial bodies. [ 1 ] The first paragraph of Article 79 GDPR establishes the data subject right to an effective judicial remedy where the data subject considers that their rights under the GDPR were infringed due to the non-compliant processing of their personal data. While the second paragraph of Article 79 GDPR addresses jurisdiction, stipulating in which Member States a data subject can bring court proceedings against a controller or a processor. Under Article 79(1) GDPR, each data subject shall have the right to an effective judicial remedy where they consider that their rights under this Regulation have been infringed as a result of the processing of their personal data in non-compliance with the GDPR. From the wording of the provision, through the use of the word ' where ', access to the right is conditional. The provision introduces a two stage cumulative test to determine the applicability of the right: (i) A data subject must consider that a controller or processor have violated their rights under the GDPR, (ii) as a result of the processing of their personal data in non-compliance with the GDPR. Article 79 GDPR is a data subject right. Resultantly, the plaintiff must be a data subject within the meaning of Article 4(1) GDP R - an identified or identifiable natural person. Legal proceedings under Article 79 GDPR can be brought both against a controller (as defined under Article 4(7) GDPR ) and a processor (as defined under Article 4(8) GDPR ). [ 2 ] As noted above, Article 79 GDPR imposes a two-stage cumulative test. The data subject must claim (i) that their personal data have been processed in breach of the GDPR, and (ii) that this processing resulted in an infringement of their rights under the GDPR. Processing in breach of the GDPR, (i), includes all violations of material data protection law such as data processing principles under Article 5 GDPR , unlawful processing under Articles 6 to 9 GDPR , or the lack of a valid transfer mechanism under Chapter V GDPR. [ 3 ] It further includes violations of delegated acts and implementing acts pursuant to Chapter X of the GDPR, as well Member State law clarifying GDPR provisions. [ 4 ] Nonetheless, for the purposes of Article 79(1) GDPR, it is not sufficient if only the processing is in breach of the GDPR, the non-compliant processing must result in an infringement of the data subject's rights under the GDPR. The second limb of the test under Article 79(1) GDPR notes that non-compliant processing with the GDPR must result in an infringement of the data subject\u2019s rights under the GDPR. Naturally, the individual rights to which the provision refers are those enumerated in Chapter III of the GDPR. Nevertheless, any additional data subject rights not explicitly addressed by Chapter III are not excluded from its scope. For instance, included in the infringement of a data subject's rights would be the failure to communicate a data breach to the data subject, the breach of the privacy by design or by default principle (which, arguably translates into a right), or, finally, an unlawful cross-border data transfer. [ 5 ] This limb of Article 79(1) GDPR necessitates a causal link between the non-compliant processing with the GDPR and the infringement of the data subject\u2019s rights. [ 6 ] This requirement would be fulfilled, for example, where a controller refuses to erase data following an erasure request under Article 17 GDPR (right to be forgotten), where the original processing of the data had no legal basis for processing under Article 6(1) GDPR . However, there are cases, where a data subject\u2019s subjective rights under the GDPR have been infringed, but not necessarily as a result of non-compliant processing under the GDPR. For example, infringements of Article 15 GDPR can occur even where no data is processed or where the processing is compliant with the GDPR. For instance, where the controller ignores a data subject\u2019s access request, the controller has undoubtedly violated Article 15 GDPR. In this case, the infringement of the data subject\u2019s right under the GDPR occurred regardless of whether or not the controller actually processed any data relating to the data subject (after all, this is what the data subject might be trying to find out by their access request). The same applies if a controller that has disregarded an access request, in fact processes the data subject\u2019s personal data, but the processing as such complies with the GDPR. In this case, the controller has nevertheless infringed Article 15 GDPR. The same is true for infringements of Article 13 and Article 14 GDP, [ 7 ] as any processing of a data subject\u2019s data by the controller triggers a data subject\u2019s right under Article 13 and 14 GDPR. We reject a strict literal interpretation of Article 79(1) GDPR, which understands the right to an effective judicial remedy arising only in instances of substantive infringements of data subject's rights. Such a reading would result in a legal deficit. Taking a rigid reading would mean that data subjects could only bring proceedings under Article 79(1) GDPR in limited circumstances of substantive violations. [ 8 ] Instead, Article 79(1) GDPR should be read as excluding proceedings where the issues have no connection to data subject's rights. In order to avoid a severe legal protection deficit, Article 79(1) GDPR must be interpreted purposively, which widens the scope of Article 79(1) GDPR to include actions for 'mere' violations of Article 13, 14 and 15 GDPR as well. [ 9 ] The purpose of Article 79(1) GDPR is to provide the data subject with an effective legal remedy before a court against infringement of their subjective rights under the GDPR. A teleological reading fulfils the requirements already stipulated by Article 47 CFR (see below for more on what constitutes an effective judicial remedy under Article 47 CFR). [ 10 ] Arguing otherwise would severely limit the scope of Article 79(1) GDPR and would go against the purpose of the provision. [ 11 ] Rather, the cumulative test under Article 79(1) GDPR must be read as excluding court proceedings based on GDPR violations that have no connection to data subject's rights. [ 12 ] This interpretation is supported by Recital 141 GDPR, according to which ' every data subject should have [\u2026] the right to an effective judicial remedy in accordance with Article 47 of the Charter if the data subject considers that his or her rights under this Regulation are infring e d '. Consequently, a data subject cannot bring proceedings under Article 79(1) GDPR where no subjective rights under the GDPR are concerned. For example, a data subject cannot use Article 79(1) GDPR to bring an action against a controller\u2019s failure to maintain records of processing activities under Article 30 GDPR , to carry out a data protection impact assessment under Article 35 GDPR , or to designate a data protection officer under Article 37 GDPR . [ 13 ] These provisions impose legal obligations upon controllers, and generally, the infringement of them does not result in the infringement of a data subject\u2019s rights under the GDPR. [ 14 ] According to some legal scholars, violations of Article 25 GDPR (data protection by default and by design) can be the subject of legal proceedings under Article 79 GDPR, if they have an effect on rights of the data subject. [ 15 ] Article 79 GDPR stipulates a directly applicable subjective right for data subjects. However, the precise procedural rules are for Member States to determine through their national law. These rules must be in line with the EU principles of equivalence and effectiveness. [ 16 ] Article 79(1) GDPR requires an effective judicial remedy. The conditions for an effective judicial remedy are based on accessibility to the courts. [ 17 ] In light of Article 47 CFR, access to courts under Article 79 GDPR must not be disproportionally difficult, for example through excessively strict admissibility requirements or prohibitive costs. [ 18 ] Other than procedures before SAs (see Article 57(3) GDPR ), legal proceedings under Article 79 GDPR do not have to be free of charge. The regulation of legal fees (both court and attorney fees) are subject to Member State law. Case law: In Schrems I , the CJEU held that for the purposes of Article 47 CFR, claimants must have access to judicial remedies enabling them to challenge decisions adversely affecting them before the national courts, [ 19 ] emphasising that the lack of any such opportunity to pursue legal remedies fails to ' respect the essence of the fundamental right to effective judicial protection, as enshrined in Article 47 of the Charter \u2019. [ 20 ] Article 79(1) GDPR stipulates the data subject\u2019s right to a judicial remedy \u201c without prejudice \u201d to any available administrative or non-judicial remedy, including the right to lodge a complaint with a SA pursuant to Article 77 GDP R. Thus, it is the data subject\u2019s free choice either to lodge a complaint under Article 77 GDPR or to bring proceedings under Article 79 GDPR \u2013 or both. This flexibility allows for parallel proceedings under both Article 77 GDPR and under Article 79 GDPR. [ 21 ] As the GDPR foresees no rules on how to handle the dangers of contradictory decisions by a SA and a court of law, [ 22 ] this question must be addressed by a Member State's national law. [ 23 ] It should be also noted that the data subject's right to an effective judicial remedy does not preclude the national legislator to implement provisions enabling competitors of a controller to challenge GDPR infringements in court as prohibited unfair commercial practices. [ 24 ] The possibility of a legal remedy against a court decision under Article 79 GDPR is subject to the procedural law of the Member States. A request for a preliminary ruling by the CJEU under Article 267 TFEU is possible at any stage of the proceedings in accordance with established principles. [ 25 ] Article 79(2) GDPR addresses the jurisdictional competences of courts. In particular, this provision acts as a lex specialis to the general rules of jurisdiction, [ 26 ] as it derogates significantly from the Brussels I Regulation (Recast) (Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012). [ 27 ] Under Article 79(2) GDPR, the data subject can choose to bring proceedings against a controller or processor either with (i) the courts of the Member State where the controller or processor has an establishment, or with (ii) the courts of the Member State where the data subject has their habitual residence. This provision takes a broad reading of the term ' establishment '. As outlined by Recital 22 GDPR, the term ' establishment implies the effective and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements. The legal form of such arrangements, whether through a branch or a subsidiary with a legal personality, is not the determining factor in that respect. ' [ 28 ] Case law : The CJEU in Google Spain in relation to the GDPR's predecessor, Directive 95/46/EC, adopted a wide interpretation of the term ' establishment' . The CJEU considered a branch or subsidiary set up in a Member State by the operator of a search engine, 'which is intended to promote and sell advertising space offered by that engine and which orientates its activity towards the inhabitants of that Member State' ,  an establishment for the purposes of Article 4(1)(a) of the Directive. [ 29 ] In cases where a controller or processor has multiple establishments, proceedings do not need to be brought against the main establishment. Article 79(2) GDPR allows data subjects the freedom to choose between a controller's or processor's establishments. [ 30 ] Notably, the data subject cannot choose where to bring proceedings against a public authority of a Member State acting in the exercise of its public powers. Such proceedings must be brought before the court of the Member State to which the public authority belongs to. [ 31 ] The question of which national court of the respective Member State is competent for legal proceedings is subject to Member State law. [ 32 ] Article 79(2) GDPR, in addition, allows data subjects to bring proceedings with the courts of the Member State where the data subject has their habitual residence. Given that term ' habitual residence ' is not defined by the GDPR, it should be read autonomously in light of Union law. [ 33 ] The term appears throughout other Union regulations, such as in the Brussels I Regulation, the Rome I Regulation and the Rome II Regulation. As clarified by CJEU jurisprudence, a person's habitual residence is determined by the place where a person habitually resides and where the habitual centre of their interests lie. The determination of these two factors necessitates a subjective intention of permanence. [ 34 ] Case law : In the case of Fern\u00e1ndez v Commission , the CJEU held that ' the place of habitual residence is that in which the official concerned has established, with the intention that it should be of a lasting character, the permanent or habitual centre of his interests. However, for the purposes of determining habitual residence, all the factual circumstances which constitute such residence must be taken into account.' [ 35 ] As noted above, Article 79(2) GDPR derogates from the general rules of jurisdiction. Recital 147 GDPR confirms that the GDPR's rules on jurisdiction take precedence over general rules of jurisdiction, in particular over the Brussels I Regulation (Recast), as regards proceedings seeking a judicial remedy, including proceedings for compensation against a controller or processor. Some Commentators have argued that to the extent that the rules of jurisdiction under the Brussels I Regulation are compatible with the GDPR, they should continue to apply, to allow plaintiffs additional choices of fora. [ 36 ] However, such a reading would go against the purpose of Article 79(2) GDPR, which aims to guard against forum shopping.

Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of his or her personal data. 2.   If the data subject's consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding. 3.  The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent. 4.   When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract. Article 7 GDPR regulates the \"conditions for consent\". It specifies the definition of consent set out in Article 4(11) GDPR and, by integrating Article 6(1)(a) GDPR , contributes to defining what legal requirements a valid consent should meet. The provision also places a special burden of proving for valid consent on the controller. While paragraph (1) further specifics the principle of accountability in Article 5(2) GDPR , paragraph (2) specifies further requirements in the general principle of transparency under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR , paragraph (3) further determines the right to withdraw consent and paragraph (4) further specifies when consent is ' freely given'. EDPB Guidelines: See especially the EDPB Guidelines 05/2020 on consent under Regulation 2016/679 . The issue of consent also comes up in other EDPB Guideliens for specific processing operations. For example see also EDPB Guidelines 03/2022 on deceptive design patterns in social media platform interfaces: how to recognise and avoid them which only apply to social media platforms but hold important general information on the use of 'dark patterns' which are often used to gain consent. Under Article 7(1) GDPR, the controller must be able to demonstrate that they have obtained data subjects\u2019 valid consent, especially whether it was informed, freely given, unambiguous and specific. It is therefore a specific burden of proof. For example: A data subject cannot remember that it gave consent. The controller says they used to have an online form that everyone had to sign, but the form cannot be found anymore. There is no digital trace of the consent. If the existence of an effective consent is disputed and the controller cannot provide evidence of this, it can be assumed that there is no consent. [ 1 ] Since consent can be given through a \"clear, affirmative act \" (see Recital 32 GDPR) in the form of a factual, written, electronic or oral declaration, data controllers are free to determine the specific mechanism to provide this evidence. [ 2 ] However, in practice, they will likely \" need to keep a registry of acquired consents, as they will need to be able to demonstrate that consent has been obtained in situations where the data subject questions her or his provision of consent. In online environments, the consent provided should be logged \". [ 3 ] The elements contained in such a register may vary depending on the type of processing and the type of consent required. For instance, since pre-ticked boxes have been declared not unambiguous and therefore unlawful, [ 4 ] controllers may need to implement consent confirmation systems that can demonstrate the clear intention of the user. For instance, the controller could send an email to the data subject requiring them to click on a confirmation button (double opt-in) to show that the person consenting is also the person having access to a mailbox. Once the user provides that confirmation, the associated token and the time may be stored in the consent register as evidence for the future. [ 5 ] For example: An implicit consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR to be in a group picture by assembling in a group may be documented by the picture itself and witnesses could confirm that the purpose of the processing was clearly communicated. However, online systems usually require some form of consent management, such as a filed in a database together with a cop of the the code and interface. Article 7(4) GDPR relates to the principle of accountability in Article 5(2) GDPR and further specifies it for situations where a controller seeks consent. Article 7(2) applies when data subjects and controllers communicate in written form about \u201cother matters\u201d, such as a longer contract, sign-up form and alike. In such cases, the request for consent must be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters. The provision ensures that the consent request is given appropriate prominence so to reduce the risk of consent being inadvertently given or overlooked. To do so, Article 7(2) GDPR sets out certain layout and transparency requirements. For the provision to apply, the communication between data subject and controller must meet two requirements: (i) it must occur in written form and (ii) it must concern other matters. Other situations, such as oral requests or stand-alone requests on forms that do not concern other matters do not have to comply with the specific provisions of Article 7(2) GDPR. The \" written form \" requirement is to be interpreted broadly, which means that the electronic form is covered by this provision. [ 6 ] The communication must concern \u201c other matters \u201d. For example, this is the case where complex legal documents deal with various types of processing and require different legal bases for each of them. If any of these processing activities rely on consent, then the provision applies. Under Recital 42, where consent is given as part of a written declaration concerning other matters, safeguards should be put in place to ensure that the data subject is aware of the meaning of their actions. Article 7(2) GDPR provides for such safeguards and requires that the request for consent shall be (i) presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters and (ii) formulated in an intelligible and easily accessible way, using clear and plain language. First, it should be \"distinguishable\" from other matters. In practice, this translates to a statement which clearly authorises the controller to carry out a specific processing operation. Therefore, the request for consent \" should be highlighted by being placed in a frame or printed in a different font or colour - to name just a few options. The requirement is aimed at stopping the common practice whereby businesses include the text for consenting to processing of personal data in the fine print of agreements\" . [ 7 ] Second, a request for consent pre-formulated by the controller should be provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. This means that even users with poor reading skills, whether due to a low level of education or lack of language skills, should understand the text and positively express their consent. [ 8 ] Thus, if the data subject is not able to grasp the meaning of their declaration, the controller must provide further clarification. [ 9 ] Further, under Recital 42 and \" in accordance with Council Directive 93/13/EEC \" (the Unfair Contract Terms Directive or \"UCTD\"), the request must not contain unfair terms. [ 10 ] The legislator uses a very similar requirement for \" concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language\" in Article 12(1) GDPR , which applies to Articles 13 to 22 and 34 GDPR. The requirements are a specification of the general principle of transparency in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR . If any part of the statement (provided by the controller to the data subject) does not meet these requirements or in any way \" constitutes an infringement of this Regulation [it] shall not be binding \". Such an infringement amounts to a clear violation of the lawfulness principle, (i.e. if the claimed legal basis is not present, see Articles 5(1)(a) and 6(1)(a) GDPR ) and should bring about the immediate stop of processing of all personal data collected. [ 11 ] For example: A hotel has all guests sign a form upon arrival, informing them about a non-smoking policy, costs for the minibar, the opening hours of the gym and many other matters. In one of the paragraphs, the hotel seeks consent to use guests' registration data for advertisement, direct mailings and alike. This consent is not valid. If a controller relies on consent under Article 6(1)(a) or Article 9(2)(a) GDPR, data subjects can withdraw their consent at any time Controllers must make data subjects aware of their right before to withdraw consent. This is usually done together with the request for consent and should follow the same transparency obligations applicable to information under Articles 5(1)(a) , 7(2) and 12(1) GDPR. It is unclear what the legal consequence of missing information is. The data subject may be even less inclines to consent when it does not know about the option to withdraw consent, which would point at missing information merely being a violation of the controllers duties under the GDPR, but not lead to the consent being invalid when a controller does not inform about the right to withdraw consent. Data subjects can withdraw their consent at any time. Other than many other rights to withdraw from a legal declaration in EU law (such as 14 days for online purchases under Directive 2011/83/EU), the right to withdraw consent has no limit. This makes long-term management of consent and withdraw necessary. This withdrawal should be as easy as giving consent. Article 7(3) GDPR clarifies that the withdrawal of consent must be as simple as the granting of consent. In the case of electronic declarations, revocation should be enabled via the same tool used to provide the consent. [ 12 ] This nonetheless poses certain technical challenges, such as the development of an appropriate revocation mechanism, especially if the person concerned does not have a user account through which they can adjust the privacy settings. The withdrawal has immediate effect and interrupts any consent-based data processing, but will not retroactively affect any processing based on previously obtained consent. [ 13 ] The withdrawal has an effect on future data processing ( ex nunc ). If there is no other purpose to process the personal data further, withdrawal of consent also requires to delete the personal data. If there are other purposes to process the same personal data, such as security reasons, the effect of a withdrawal would be a partial limitation or processing. This means, that a data subject typically will not have to submit another request for erasure under Article 17(1)(b) GDPR . [ 14 ] Article 7(4) GDPR provides some useful guidance on the factors to be taken into account in assessing whether consent has been freely given or not. The provision focuses on the common practice of linking the performance of a service to the granting of consent for the processing of data which is not strictly necessary for the stated purpose (\"bundled consent\"). However, the EDPB noted that Article7(4) GDPR was drafted in a non-exhaustive fashion by using the words \" inter alia \". This means that bundled consent is not the only factor of the analysis and that \" there may be a \u201crange of other situations, which are caught by this provision. In general terms, any element of inappropriate pressure or influence upon the data subject (which may be manifested in many different ways) which prevents a data subject from exercising their free will, shall render the consent invalid \u201d. [ 15 ] The first critical factor is the presence of imbalance of power between the data subject and the controller. The typical example is the relationship between citizens and public authorities, where it seems clear that in the majority of cases the data subject will have no viable alternative but to accept the data processing. Another case of imbalance of power also occurs in the employment relationship, where it seems hardly credible that the data subject would refuse their consent without facing or at least perceiving the risk of detrimental effects on their employment. The EDPB also pointed out that imbalances of power are not limited to relationships with public authorities and employers, but can occur in any other case where there is \" any element of compulsion, pressure or inability to exercise free will \". [ 16 ] Overall are many other situations where an economic or other factual imbalance makes a genuinely free choice of the data subject unrealistic, such as various forms of monopolies and oligopolies or other situations where data subjects have no realistic alternative. The second factor identified by the EDPB is the case set out in Article 7(4) GDPR which consists of \u201cbundling\u201d consent with acceptance of terms or conditions, or \u201ctying\u201d the provision of a contract or a service to a request for consent to process personal data that are not necessary for the performance of that contract or service. Article 7(4) seeks to ensure that the purpose of personal data processing is not \u201c disguised nor bundled with the provision of a contract of a service for which these personal data are not necessary. In doing so, the GDPR ensures that the processing of personal data for which consent is sought cannot become directly or indirectly the counter-performance of a contract. The two lawful bases for the lawful processing of personal data, i.e. consent and contract cannot be merged and blurred \u201d. Such practices are considered highly undesirable because consent is presumed to not have been freely given in this situation (Recital 43). [ 17 ] Another critical profile identified by the EDPB relates to the lack of granularity in the provision of consent. Whenever a controller forces the data subject to give a single consent for multiple types of processing with one action (e.g., newsletters and communication to third parties), \"there is a lack of freedom [...] the solution to comply with the conditions for valid consent lies in granularity, i.e. the separation of these purposes and obtaining consent for each purpose\". [ 18 ] The controller must be able to demonstrate that refusal or withdrawal of consent will not have a detrimental effect on the data subject. Any kind of pressure, coercion or significant adverse effect, including a reduction of service, is likely to generate a detrimental effect and thus invalidate consent. [ 19 ] EDPB Guidelines: on this provision there are EDPB Guidelines 05/2020 on consent under Regulation 2016/679 \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 7 GDPR \u2191 Heckmann, Paschke , in Ehmann, Selmayr, Datenschutz-Grundverordnung, Article 7 GDPR, margin number 68 (C.H.

References 1. The data subject shall have the right to mandate a not-for-profit body, organisation or association which has been properly constituted in accordance with the law of a Member State, has statutory objectives which are in the public interest, and is active in the field of the protection of data subjects\u2019 rights and freedoms with regard to the protection of their personal data to lodge the complaint on his or her behalf, to exercise the rights referred to in Articles 77, 78 and 79 on his or her behalf, and to exercise the right to receive compensation referred to in Article 82 on his or her behalf where provided for by Member State law. 2. Member States may provide that any body, organisation or association referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, independently of a data subject\u2019s mandate, has the right to lodge, in that Member State, a complaint with the supervisory authority which is competent pursuant to Article 77 and to exercise the rights referred to in Articles 78 and 79 if it considers that the rights of a data subject under this Regulation have been infringed as a result of the processing. Article 80 GDPR grants data subjects the right to mandate not-for-profit entities (' NPOs ') for the enforcement of their rights under the GDPR. The purpose of this provision is to remedy the deficits of legal protection for individuals and facilitate the enforcement of the GDPR. [ 1 ] The Article regulates how and which NPOs may be mandated by data subjects. In contrast to the data subject's right to mandate a NPO to lodge complaints and exercise the rights referred to in Articles 77 , 78 and 79 GDPR , wich exists independent from any implementation in national law, the right to mandate a NPO to claim compensation under Article 82 GDPR on his or her is subject to such an implementation. [ 2 ] The second paragraph of Article 80 GDPR contains another opening clause allowing Member States to introduce a right to lodge complaints to data protection authorities and file judicial remedies with national courts independently of a mandate by a data subject. [ 3 ] Article 80(1) GDPR establishes the data subject right to mandate a not-for-profit body, organisation or association to lodge a complaint on their behalf, to exercise the rights referred to in Articles 77 , 78 , 79 and 82 GDPR . The first paragraph of Article 80 GDPR establishes several cumulative conditions for entities to qualify as NPOs. For the purposes of Article 80(1) GDPR must be (i) a not-for-profit body, organisation or association,  (ii) properly constituted in accordance with the law of a Member State, (iii) have statutory objectives which are in the public interest, and (iv) must be active in the field of the protection of data subjects\u2019 rights and freedoms with regard to the protection of their personal data. Example : The CJEU affirmed the status of a consumer protection association as a NPO under Article 80(1) since the association perused a \" public interest objective consisting in safeguarding the rights and freedoms of data subjects in their capacity as consumers \", since such an objective is related to the protection of the personal data of those persons. [ 4 ] The understanding of the term ' not-for-profit' must be given an autonomous meaning, its interpretation in this context should not be determined by Member State law. [ 5 ] Essentially, an NPO must not pursue profit-making objectives. However, it may recover its costs by charging a fee or a reimbursement of expenses for its activities, so long as this does not pursue profit-making aims. The term \u201c body, organisation or association \u201d encompasses only legal persons independent of their legal form under Member State law, but not natural persons. [ 6 ] In this regard, the decisive factor is whether an entity is capable of holding rights and obligations under its Member States' national law. Organisations established outside of the Union and European Economic Area cannot represent data subjects under Article\u00a080(1)\u00a0GDPR. [ 7 ] An NPO can be organised under public law of a Member State (such as national chambers of labour or consumer protection organisations foreseen by statutory law), or under civil law (such as private associations). [ 8 ] The interpretation of the term ' public interest' must be done so autonomously, independently of Member State law. [ 9 ] The term is to be read broadly, and incorporates the protection of other fundamental rights and freedoms under Union law, as well as the promotion of the general principles of Union law as established in the TEU and TFEU. [ 10 ] Notably, the public interest does not need to be restricted solely to data protection law. Nonetheless, the NPO's activities must be in some capacity active in the field of data protection. [ 11 ] As noted above, Article 80(1) GDPR does not necessitate that the NPO is exclusively active in the field of data protection. However, it must at least be active in the public interest with a connection to data protection. [ 12 ] This requirement would include, for example, consumer protection organisations, [ 13 ] workers unions or chambers of labour but excludes entities pursuing commercial interests. [ 14 ] Article 80(1) GDPR establishes the data subject right to mandate an NPO, so long as the NPO qualifies as such in light of the Article's requirements. Firstly, the data subject may mandate the NPO to lodge a complaint under Article 77(1) GDPR on behalf of the data subject and to represent the them before all supervisory authorities (\u201c SA \u201d) (Article 4(21) GDPR). [ 15 ] Secondly, the NPO may be mandated to file for a legal remedy under Article 78(1) GDPR against a legally binding SA decision concerning the data subject. Thirdly, the NPO may file for a legal remedy under Article 78(2) GDPR , on behalf of the data subject, where the competent SA for the purposes of Articles 55 and 56 GDPR does not handle a complaint, or does not inform the data subject within three months on the progress or outcome of the complaint lodged pursuant to Article 77 GDPR . Lastly, the NPO may file a legal remedy under Article 79 GDPR against a controller or processor regarding a GDPR infringement. The conditions for the right to mandate an NPO for the exercise of the right to receive compensation under Article 82 GDPR , can be distinguished from the right to mandate an NPO for the exercise of the rights under Articles 77 , 78 and 79 GDPR . The provision includes an opening clause, which notes that the right to mandate an NPO for the exercise of the rights under Article 82 GDPR , can only be given effect ' where provided for by Member State law '. Consequently, the regulation of representation in damages proceedings are left to the Member States. [ 16 ] The majority of Commentators have interpreted the conditional phrase ' where provided for by Member State law ' in Article\u00a080(1)\u00a0GDPR, as only applying to the mandate for the exercise of the right to receive compensation under Article 82 GDPR . [ 17 ] In relation to the right to mandate an NPO for the exercise of the rights under Articles 77 , 78 , and 79 GDPR , there is no prior requirement for further legislation by the Member State. This reading is further supported by Recital 142 GDPR, which clarifies that the words ' where provided for by Member State law ' only apply to the exercise of the right to receive compensation referred to in Article 82 GDPR . Furthermore, the legislative history of Article\u00a080\u00a0GDPR affirms this interpretation. The right to mandate a NPO when exercising the right to receive compensation under Article\u00a082\u00a0GDPR was not included in the initial draft of Article 80 GDPR (then Article 73) and was only inserted later by the European Parliament. Following the submission of the original draft, during the Trialogue proceedings, the right to mandate NPOs when exercising the right to compensation was made subject to an opening clause. [ 18 ] Nonetheless, even in instances where a Member State has not made use of the opening clause in relation to Article 82 GDPR , claims for damages may still be undertaken by an NPO if this is permitted under the civil law of the Member State. In such cases, the NPO would not represent the data subject but claim the assigned damages on its own behalf and forward any compensations received through the court proceedings to the data subject. The Collective Redress Directive (Directive (EU) 2020/1828) foresees that qualified non-profit entities shall be entitled to bring representative actions on behalf of consumers for certain infringements of EU law. [ 19 ] According to Article 2 and Annex 1 of the Collective Redress Directive, these actions include issues relating to GDPR infringements. Depending on the respective national implementation of the Collective Redress Directive, the opening clause in Article 80(1) GDPR might become somewhat redundant, as Member States would have to entitle NPOs to represent data subjects in connection with claims for compensation under Article\u00a082\u00a0GDPR . The second paragraph of Article 80 GDPR also acts as an opening clause, which enables Member States to provide for the right of NPOs to file a complaint or instigate legal proceedings in the absence of a mandate by a data subject's mandate. Therefore, it is in the discretion of the member states to implement this provision into their national law. In the absence of such an implementation an NPO cannot bring forward a representative action in accordance with this provision. [ 20 ] Example : Regarding the member state's discretion in the implementation of this provision, the CJEU held that Article 80(2) of the GDPR must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation which allows a consumer protection association to bring legal proceedings, on the basis of the infringement of the prohibition of unfair commercial practices, a breach of a consumer protection law or the prohibition of the use of invalid general terms and conditions, where the data processing concerned can affect the rights data subjects derive from the GDPR. [ 21 ] According to Article 80(2) GDPR, where implemented by Member States, this right extends to the lodging of a complaint in accordance with Article 77 and to the legal remedies listed in Articles 78 and 79 GDPR . However, the provision does not cover the claim for for compensation under Article 82 GDPR . This exclusion of Article 82 GDPR is confirmed by the last sentence of Recital 142 GDPR which states that NPOs \" may not be allowed to claim compensation on a data subject's behalf independently of the data subject's mandate \". In addition, Article 80(2) GDPR does not permit Member States to allow NPOs to take legal actions against any kind of GDPR infringement. The wording of Article 80(2) GDPR specifically requires that the NPO \u201c[\u2026] considers that the rights of a data subject under this Regulation have been infringed as a result of the processing .\u201d Hence, NPOs must have reasons to consider that the rights of a data subject under that regulation have been infringed as a result of the processing of personal data which infringes the GDPR. [ 22 ] In connection with this requirement the CJEU found that an infringement of the data subject's right to information under Article 12 and 13 GDPR can be regarded as an infringement of the data subject's rights \"as a result of the processing\" within the meaning of Article 80(2) GDPR. [ 23 ] It should be noted that this specification does not require the NPO to name or identify a a specific data subject that is affected by the data processing that is contrary to provisions of the GDPR. [ 24 ] Rather this question must be assessed on an abstract level, looking to whether any data subjects\u2019 GDPR rights could have been violated by the processing activity in question.

References 1. Where a competent court of a Member State has information on proceedings, concerning the same subject matter as regards processing by the same controller or processor, that are pending in a court in another Member State, it shall contact that court in the other Member State to confirm the existence of such proceedings. 2.

Where those proceedings are pending at first instance, any court other than the court first seized may also, on the application of one of the parties, decline jurisdiction if the court first seized has jurisdiction over the actions in question and its law permits the consolidation thereof. Article 81 GDPR regulates the suspension of judicial proceedings in multiple Member States in the context of data protection . The Article addresses issues of coordination where parallel proceedings are brought in the courts of different Member States. The lis pendens rules under Article 81 GDPR differ slightly from those under the Brussels I Regulation (Recast) (Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012) (' Brussels Ia' ). Nonetheless, both serve the purpose of preventing contradictory decisions on the same subject matter. Namely, the difference lies with Article 81(2) GDPR, which allows courts discretion to suspend their proceedings. No such discretion exists under the Brussels Ia. Notably, Article 81's relevance is confined to proceedings related to the private sector. Proceedings against controllers or processors which act as public bodies are confined to the national courts of the Member States where the public body is established. [ 1 ] However, in Member States that have a separation between administrative and civil courts (e.g. France, Germany, Italy or Austria) both types of court are subject to Article 81 GDPR. There exist differing opinions among legal scholars as to the scope of Article 81 GDPR. In particular, the discussion concerns what type of court proceedings fall under its ambit. Some Commentators have interpreted Recital 144 GDPR to have limited the scope of Article\u00a081 GDPR, as applying only to proceedings instigated under Article 78 GDPR . The first sentence of Recital 144  GDPR refers to ' court[s] seized of proceedings against a decision by a supervisory authority ', but makes no mention of proceedings against a controller or processor, which are subject to Article 79 GDPR . [ 2 ] They have interpreted this sentence to have implicitly restricted the applicability of Article 81 GDPR. This is a reading that we reject. The prevailing opinion, one which we affirm, is that Article 81 GDPR applies to proceedings both under Articles 78 and 79 GDPR . This broader reading of Article 81 GDPR is supported by several interpretative grounds. Firstly, the explicit wording of Article 81 GDPR does not limit its application to proceedings instigated either under Article 78 GDPR or Article 79 GDPR. Secondly, the purpose of Article 81 GDPR is to prevent contradictory decisions arising from parallel proceedings. Consequently, it goes against the provision's purpose to take a restrictive reading of its scope. Lastly, Recital 144 GDPR holds no normative authority. Thus, it cannot limit the scope of a GDPR provision where the GDPR itself does not impose any formal restrictions on the Article's applicability. [ 3 ] Article 81(1) GDPR requires that the competent court of a Member State to contact the court of another Member State, when it has information that proceedings concerning the ' same subject matter ' by ' the same controller or processor ' are pending in that court, to confirm the existence of such proceedings. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that both Courts are made aware of parallel proceedings. Article 81(1) GDPR places a positive legal obligation on the competent court to contact the court of another Member State, when it becomes aware of (possible) proceedings concerning the same subject matter pending in that court. If the same subject matter is pending in another court of the same Member State, Article 81 GDPR does not apply and the conflict is to be resolved under national law. [ 4 ] This obligation only arises once the court becomes aware that proceedings concerning the same subject matter may be pending in the court of another Member State. In most cases, one or both parties will notify the court of pending parallel proceedings. [ 5 ] The competent court is under no obligation to conduct proactive research to determine whether such proceedings exist. [ 6 ] However, if the competent court 'has reason to believe that such proceedings exist ', [ 7 ] it must contact the court in the other Member State to confirm the matter. Due to the provision's use of the imperative ' shall [contact] ', the court has no discretionary power in this respect. [ 8 ] Parallel proceedings are only deemed to arise when they concern the ' same subject matter '. Given that the GDPR does not define the concept, the meaning of ' same subject matter ' must be interpreted autonomously. [ 9 ] However, Commentators have noted that the meaning cannot be drawn from Article 29 Brussels Ia, which establishes the concept of ' same cause of action '. Instead, its meaning should be formed in light of Article 30 Brussels Ia, whose wording bears a closer resemblance to that of Article 81 GDPR and its supporting Recital 144 GDPR. [ 10 ] For instance, the wording of Recital 144 mirrors that of Article 30(3) Brussels Ia, which notes that proceedings ' are deemed to be related where they are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together in order to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings. ' When this Recital is read in line with Article 81(1) GDPR, it is evident that the concept of the ' same subject matter ' does not necessitate that the same claim is asserted. [ 11 ] Nevertheless, some scholars argue that for the purposes of Article 81(1), parallel proceedings are only deemed to have occurred when the purpose of the proceedings, the facts and circumstances and the alleged GDPR infringements are identical. [ 12 ] However, other scholars more convincingly argue that the decisive factor determining whether proceedings are deemed to have the same subject matter, is whether the claim concerns the same processing activity (as defined by Article 4(2) GDPR ), because Article\u00a081(1)\u00a0GDPR explicitly refers to ' processing by the same controller or processor '. [ 13 ] As a result, the Article does not require that all parties to the proceedings are identical. Instead, it necessitates that the same controller or processor are party to different proceedings and that these proceedings concern the same processing activities of the controller or processor, but not that the same data subject(s) must be party to the proceedings. [ 14 ] If the requirements of Article 81(1) GDPR are fulfilled (meaning, \u201c same subject matter \u201d concerning \u201c the same controller or processor \u201d simultaneously \u201c pending in a court in another Member State \u201d) any competent court other than the court first seized may suspend its proceedings. The courts are under no strict obligation to suspend the proceeding but rather have discretion in this respect. [ 15 ] Notably, the wording of Article 81(2) GDPR draws similarities with Article 29(1) Brussels Ia. However, Brussels Ia necessitates the suspension of proceedings until the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established, while the GDPR imposes no similar obligation. Under Article 81 GDPR, Courts are afforded discretion regarding the decision to suspend proceedings. [ 16 ] When assessing the necessity for suspension, the court must take into account Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (\u2018 CFR \u2019), and avoid overly long proceedings due to suspension. [ 17 ] It is not necessary that a party requests the suspension. The court decides on the suspension on its own volition. Contrary to Article 81(3) GDPR, Article 81(2) GDPR does not require that proceedings are suspended only ' on the application of one of the parties ', but nevertheless, the competent court should take into account the parties' wishes and requests in its assessment. [ 18 ] Article 81(2) GDPR imposes temporal considerations, as only competent courts other than the court first seised may suspend their proceedings. The concept of pendency determines the court first seised. However, as the GDPR does not define this concept, its meaning must be interpreted autonomously through Union law. Commentators have suggested that the notion of pendency should be determined through the criteria of Article 32 Brussels Ia, which refers to the date of filing with the court. [ 19 ] If both proceedings are pending at the same time, then neither court has the option to suspend proceedings. [ 20 ] Article 81(3) GDPR allows for the consolidation of proceedings. The consolidation of proceedings occurs once all competent courts, other than the court first seised, decline jurisdiction. Just as Article 81(2) GDPR affords courts the discretion to suspend proceedings, so does Article 81(3) GDPR in relation to the consolidation of proceedings. [ 21 ] The provision stipulates that where parallel proceedings are pending at first instance, any court other than the court first seised may also, on the application of one of the parties, decline jurisdiction if the court first seised has jurisdiction over the actions in question and its law permits the consolidation of the existing proceedings. Consequently Article 81(3) GDPR establishes several cumulative conditions for the consolidation of proceedings: (i) one of the parties (or both parties) have requested that the relevant court decline jurisdiction; (ii) all proceedings are still pending at first instance; (iii) the court first seised has jurisdiction over the actions in question; and (iv) the Member State law applicable to the proceedings pending in the court first seised permits the consolidation of the proceedings. The fulfilment of requirement (iv) is a question of Member State law. As not all Member States might provide for the consolidation of legal actions pending in different Member States, this requirement substantially narrows the scope of applicability of Article 81(3) GDPR. [ 22 ] Furthermore, it remains unclear how the court subsequently called upon are supposed to assess with sufficient legal certainty if requirements (iii) and (iv) are fulfilled, regarding the court first seised. [ 23 ] From a practical viewpoint, these requirements necessitate certain communication and coordination between courts in different Member States. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 81 GDPR \u2191 Kotschy , in Kuner et al., The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Article 81 GDPR, p. 1154 (Oxford University Press 2020). \u2191 Feiler, Forg\u00f3 , EU-DSGVO, Article 81 GDPR, margin number 1 (Verlag \u00d6sterreich 2017); also see Feldmann in Gierschmann, Schlender, Stentzel, Veil, Article 81 GDPR, margin number 10 (Bundesanzeiger Verlag 2017). \u2191 Mundil in Wolff, Brink, BeckOK DatenschutzR, Article 81 GDPR, margin number 8 (C.H.

A processor shall be liable for the damage caused by processing only where it has not complied with obligations of this Regulation specifically directed to processors or where it has acted outside or contrary to lawful instructions of the controller. 3.   A controller or processor shall be exempt from liability under paragraph 2 if it proves that it is not in any way responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. 4.   Where more than one controller or processor, or both a controller and a processor, are involved in the same processing and where they are, under paragraphs 2 and 3, responsible for any damage caused by processing, each controller or processor shall be held liable for the entire damage in order to ensure effective compensation of the data subject. 5.   Where a controller or processor has, in accordance with paragraph 4, paid full compensation for the damage suffered, that controller or processor shall be entitled to claim back from the other controllers or processors involved in the same processing that part of the compensation corresponding to their part of responsibility for the damage, in accordance with the conditions set out in paragraph 2. 6.   Court proceedings for exercising the right to receive compensation shall be brought before the courts competent under the law of the Member State referred to in Article 79(2). Article 82 GDPR introduces a right to compensation for damage caused as a result of an infringement of the GDPR. Article 82(1)  contains the conditions for such a claim, which are to be interpreted in accordance with EU law. Such conditions include an infringement of the Regulation, the existence of a material or non-material negative consequence (the damage) and a causal link between these two elements. [ 1 ] A claim can be brought by \" any person \", not just a data subject, against the controller or processor. Article 82(2) differentiates between controller and processor\u2019s liability, mirroring the division of functions established by the GDPR. Article 82(3) regulates the burden of proof, excluding a strict liability regime. Article 82(4) and (5) GDPR set out rules concerning the liability relationships in the case of several damaging parties. According to Article 82(4) GDPR, each damaging party is liable vis-\u00e0-vis the damaged party for the entire amount (joint liability). Article 82(5) GDPR regulates the internal compensation between the damaging parties. Finally, Article 82(6) establishes the competence of courts to adjudicate on claims for damages, in accordance with applicable national law. Article 82(1) of the GDPR stipulates that any person who has suffered material or non-material damage as a result of an GDPR infringement has the right to receive compensation from the controller or processor for the damage suffered.  The right to compensation is therefore subject to three cumulative conditions: an infringement of the provisions of the GDPR; the existence of \u2018damage\u2019, whether material or non-material which has been suffered; and the causal link between that damage and that infringement. Article 82 GDPR \u2013 like almost all provisions of the GDPR \u2013 is directly applicable in all Member States without any act of implementation. Article 82 GDPR leaves the Member States no room for manoeuvre at all. Member State deviations that are not compatible with Article 82 GDPR must therefore \u2013 in accordance with the principle of the primacy of Union law \u2013 remain inapplicable. [ 2 ] In this context, it should also be pointed out that this provision is only to be interpreted according to Union law and not according to the law of the Member States. Emphasising this self-evident fact is necessary, as this is not always followed in the case law and literature of some Member States. [ 3 ] However, as the CJEU has pointed out, in accordance with the principle of procedural autonomy, it is for the national legal order of each Member State to establish procedural rules for actions intended to safeguard the rights of individuals. These rules must not be less favourable than those governing similar domestic situations (principle of equivalence) and they must not make it excessively difficult or impossible in practice to exercise the rights conferred by EU law (principle of effectiveness). [ 4 ] Among others, this is relevant for rules on the assessment of damages under the GDPR, since the GDPR itself does not provide for such rules. Article 82(1) GDPR identifies the person who is entitled to bring a claim for damages under the GDPR in very broad terms. The claimant can be \u201c any person \u201d. Therefore, according to the explicit wording, which is also congruent with Recital 146 sentence 1 of the GDPR, a person who is not a \u201c data subject \u201d can also be entitled to bring an action. We can imagine, for example, the case where a data breach affecting a data subject also entails monetary negative consequences for a third person whose data were not directly processed. It is disputed whether legal persons can also be damaged parties. [ 5 ] Paragraph (1) also defines the personal scope of a claim with regard to its passive subject (the damaging entity). Only controllers and processors within the meaning of Article 4(7) and (8) GDPR can be liable for compensation. A claim for damages first requires an infringement of the GDPR. Article 82 GDPR does not contain a catalogue of infringements that justify compensation. In this respect, any infringement of the GDPR, be it a right, an obligation or a principle fulfils this requirement. In particular, the infringement is not limited to violations of Chapter III ('Right of the Data Subject'). As a matter of fact, according to Recital 146 sentence 5 GDPR, Article 82 GDPR also allows claims for damages for infringements of \u201c delegated and implementing acts adopted in accordance with this Regulation and Member State law specifying rules of this Regulation \u201d. [ 6 ] The second requirement for the right to compensation under Article 82(1) is the existence of a 'damage'. According to the clear wording of Article 82 GDPR, damage must have occurred in order to justify a claim for damages. In its landmark judgement C-300/21 , the CJEU clarified that 'damage' shall be clearly distinguishable from the infringement itself, to be compensated. A simple violation of the GDPR does not automatically give rise to a claim under Article 82(1). [ 7 ] Defining the concept of damage is therefore of crucial importance in determining the existence of a right to compensation. A key objective of the GDPR is effectiveness. This becomes particularly clear with regard to damages in the wording of Recital 146 sentence 6 GDPR, according to which not only \u201c full \u201d but also \u201c effective \u201d compensation has to be paid. Therefore, the concept of damage is necessarily broad under the GDPR. [ 8 ] \"[The CJEU] has repeatedly interpreted Article 82(1) to the effect that mere infringement of that regulation is not sufficient to confer a right to compensation on that basis, since the existence of \u2018damage\u2019, whether material or non-material, or of \u2018damage\u2019 which has been \u2018suffered\u2019 constitutes one of the conditions for the right to compensation laid down in that provision, as does the existence of an infringement of the provisions of that regulation and of a causal link between that damage and that infringement, those three conditions being cumulative. Accordingly, the person seeking compensation for non-material damage on the basis of that provision is required to establish not only infringement of that regulation, but also that that infringement has actually caused him or her such damage\". CJEU - C\u2011507/23 - PTAC , margin number 24. It should also be noted that the GDPR does not contain any provision defining the rules on the assessment of damages suffered under Article 82 GDPR. Therefore, it is up to the national legal order of each Member State to establish the respective procedural rules, i.e. rules for assessing the amount of compensation due must be described in the legal system of each member state. National courts must apply those domestic rules regarding the amount of any financial compensation, provided that the principles of equivalence and effectiveness of EU law are observed, meaning that the national law must provide for a full and effective compensation of the damages suffered. [ 9 ] \"[...] it should be noted that the GDPR does not contain any provision intended to define the rules on the assessment of the damages to which a data subject, within the meaning of Article 4(1) [GDPR], may be entitled under Article 82 thereof, where an infringement of that regulation has caused him or her harm. Therefore, in the absence of rules of EU law governing the matter, it is for the legal system of each Member State to prescribe the detailed rules governing actions for safeguarding rights which individuals derive from Article 82 and, in particular, the criteria for determining the extent of the compensation payable in that context, subject to compliance with those principles of equivalence and effectiveness [...]\". CJEU - C-300/21 - \u00d6sterreichische Post AG , margin number 54. Recital 85 GDPR lists a number of examples of possible damages such as loss of control over personal data, limitation of data subjects' rights, discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation, damage to reputation, loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional secrecy and any other significant economic or social disadvantage. Article 82(1) makes reference to two different kinds of damages: material and non-material. Material damages are any out of pocket loss caused by a violation of the GDPR. They are usually forms of secondary harm (such as the loss of a job, the damage from having a contract denied or the damage from price discrimination), that are indirectly caused by a violation of the data subject's rights under GDPR. Out of pocket losses can be objectively quantified in economic terms and this makes the damage \u2018material\u2019. Non-material damages are the emotional damage caused by the illegal processing of personal data itself. It is worth repeating that the concept of non-material damages has to be interpreted autonomous and uniform specific to EU law. [ 10 ] However, there is no objective value of emotional damages and it will be up to the civil courts to quantify these damages. [ 11 ] This problem is not specific to the GDPR, as also other emotional damages (e.g. \u2018pain and suffering\u2019) exist and are mainly determined by case law. Traditionally, different Member States have very different approaches when it comes to the calculation of emotional damages. This makes it very hard not only to predict exact amounts but also to harmonise the matter at the European level. [ 12 ] For example: National Courts might take some guidance from decisions on the European level: The European General Court held that the unlawful data transfer of a data subject's personal data to the United States led to no-material damages as it put the data subject in a position of some uncertainty as regards the processing of his personal data, in particular of his IP address. Therefore, the European General Court awarded the data subject \u20ac400.00. [ 13 ] For example: In a case concerning damage in the form of a loss of control over a telephone number due to a scraping incident, the German Federal Court of Justice considered \u20ac100 as reasonable for the non-material damage. The court took into account the following factors: (i) the possible sensitivity of the specific personal data concerned as well as its typical intended use; (ii) the type of loss of control (limited or unlimited group of recipients), (iii) the duration of the loss of control, (iv) the possibility of regaining control, for example by removing data from the Internet or changing the personal data (e.g. change of telephone number; new credit card number). In cases where regaining control is possible with reasonable effort, the hypothetical effort required to regain control (in the specific case, the change of telephone number) could serve as an indication of effective compensation for the suffered damage. [ 14 ] The specific requirements for the occurrence of non-material damages are somewhat opaque. For example, it has been argued that making personal data accessible to third parties without their consent may constitute non-material damage due to the inherent public exposure. [ 15 ] A frequent issue was whether the mere loss of control over personal data, such as e.g. in a data breach, could entail non-material damage. [ 16 ] Meanwhile the CJEU clarified that the loss of control over personal data may constitute \u2018non-material damage\u2019 if a data subject shows that they actually suffered such damage. [ 17 ] This includes cases where no actual misuse of the respective data is proven. [ 18 ] \"The loss of control over personal data, even for a short period of time, may constitute \u2018non-material damage\u2019, within the meaning of Article 82(1) of the GDPR, giving rise to a right to compensation, provided that the data subject can show that he or she has actually suffered such damage, however slight, bearing in mind that the mere infringement of the provisions of that regulation is not sufficient to confer a right to compensation on that basis [...]. CJEU - C\u2011590/22 - PS (Incorrect address) , margin number 33. Similarly, the CJEU held that mere negative feelings experienced by the data subject, such as fear or annoyance , which are caused by a loss of control over those data, by a potential misuse of those data or by harm to the data subject's reputation can constitute a non-material damage, provided that the data subject demonstrates that they is experiencing such feelings. [ 19 ] As stated above, the calculation of the extend of damages and its (financial) compensation is subject to Member State's domestic legal system applied by national courts, provided such compensation is full and effective and in line with the principles of equivalence and effectiveness. [ 9 ] In connection with the principle of effectiveness, Recital 146 GDPR should be kept in mind which reads: \"The concept of damage should be broadly interpreted in the light of the case-law of the Court of Justice in a manner which fully reflects the objectives of this Regulation.\" and \"Data subjects should receive full and effective compensation for the damage they have suffered\". For the compensation to be full and effective, a financial compensation must be compensated in its entirety . This precludes any national law provisions (and practices) that make the compensation for (non-material) damages subject to the condition that the damage suffered has reached a certain degree of seriousness. [ 20 ] The Germany practice favoured by many scholars and some courts regarding \u201c minimal violations \u201d ( Bagatellversto\u00df ) that do not give rise to damages under GDPR is therefore not compatible with EU law. Article 82 GDPR does not foresee such an exception for \u201c minimal violations \u201d and there is no opening clause that would allow national law or case law to create such an exception. \"Making compensation for non-material damage subject to a certain threshold of seriousness would risk undermining the coherence of the rules established by the GDPR, since the graduation of such a threshold, on which the possibility or otherwise of obtaining that compensation would depend, would be liable to fluctuate according to the assessment of the courts seised. [...] The fact remains that the interpretation thus adopted cannot be understood as meaning that a person concerned by an infringement of the GDPR which had negative consequences for him or her would be relieved of the need to demonstrate that those consequences constitute non-material damage within the meaning of Article 82 of that regulation.\" CJEU - C-300/21 - \u00d6sterreichische Post AG , margin number 49 et seq. \"[...] Article 82(1) of the GDPR does not require that, following a proven infringement of provisions of that regulation, the damage alleged by the data subject must reach a \u2018de minimis threshold\u2019 in order to give rise to a right to compensation [...]\" CJEU - Joined Cases C\u2011182/22 and C\u2011189/22 - Scalable Capital , margin number 44. This means that if even if a damage is rather small and not particularly serious, national courts have to award compensations that compensate the damage suffered in full - even if this leads to a minimal (financial) compensation. [ 21 ] \"[...] where the damage suffered by the data subject is not serious, a national court may compensate for it by awarding minimal compensation to that person, provided that the small amount of damages thus granted is such as to offset in full that damage [...]\". CJEU - C\u2011507/23 - PTAC , margin number 35. In one case, the CJEU held that - where so provided by national law - an apology could constitute a compensation for non-material damages, provided that such an apology complies with the principles of equivalence and effectiveness, in particular, it must compensate the suffered damage in full: \" [...] Article 82(1) of the GDPR does not preclude the making of an apology from being able to constitute standalone or supplementary compensation for non-material damage, as laid down in the present case in Article 14 of the Law of 2005, provided that such a form of compensation complies with those principles of equivalence and effectiveness, in particular in that it must serve to compensate in full the non-material damage that has actually been suffered as a result of the infringement of that regulation, which it is for the national court before which the case has been brought to ascertain, taking account of the circumstances of each individual case.\" CJEU - C\u2011507/23 - PTAC , margin number 36. The purpose of this provision lies in the compensation of any damage suffered. This does not include the payment of any punitive damages. [ 22 ] \"Having regard to the exclusively compensatory, rather than punitive, function fulfilled by that right to compensation, the gravity of such an infringement cannot influence the amount of damages granted under Article 82(1) and that amount cannot be set at a level that exceeds full compensation for that damage [...] Only the damage actually suffered by the data subject must be taken into consideration in order to determine the amount of such monetary compensation [...]. [...] Likewise, there would be a lack of observance of the exclusively compensatory function of Article 82(1) if the controller\u2019s attitude and motivation were taken into account in order to determine the form of compensation granted on the basis of that provision or in order to award redress that is \u2018smaller\u2019 than full compensation for the damage suffered by the data subject [...]\". CJEU - C\u2011507/23 - PTAC , margin number 43 et seq. Due to the exclusively compensatory function of the right to compensation in Article 82 GDPR, the attitude and motivation of the controller (i.e. the degree of seriousness of the fault on the part of the controller) are irrelevant for the purpose of calculating the amount of damages suffered. [ 23 ] Like any other element of material law, the right to compensation is subject to the rules on burden of proof. As a general rule, it falls upon the party who presents the facts favourable to them. Each element of the right to compensation - infringement, damage and causal link - should thus be proved by the person damaged. It has been discussed whether a general reversal of the burden of proof for all requirements of a claim for damages could be derived from the accountability obligation enshrined in Article 5(2) GDPR. [ 24 ] This theory is not totally convincing. In light of Article 5(2) GDPR, a reversal of burden of proof for the infringement may be reasonable. However, is doubtful whether this also extends to the other requirements. Therefore, it can be assumed that the legislator did not provide for a general reversal of the burden of proof. By contrast, the legislator established an explicit reversal of the burden of proof for the responsibility requirement (subjective requirement of the damage) mentioned by Article 82(3), to which we refer. The first sentence of Article 82(2) states that a controller involved in processing shall be liable for the damage caused by any conduct which infringes the GDPR. This means that each controller involved in a processing is in principle fully liable for the resulting damage. In this respect, it is sufficient that the controller can be regarded as the controller for the processing in question within the meaning of Article 4(7) GDPR. According to the second sentence, a processor is liable for damage only in two cases: (1) it did not comply with obligations of the GDPR specifically directed to processors; (2) it acted outside or contrary to lawful instructions of the controller. The obligations of the GDPR specifically directed to processors include all provisions in which a processor is named as the norm addressee. It is irrelevant whether it is named alone or together with or as an alternative to the controller. [ 25 ] The obligation to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures according to Article 32(1) GDPR would be an example of such an obligation. [ 26 ] It is also important to stress that, without prejudice to the processor's liability under Article 82(2), according to Article 28(10) GDPR a processor that infringes the Regulation by determining the purposes and means of processing becomes controller with regard to that processing and is consequently subject to liability rules applicable to controllers - including thus further liability. On the basis of Article 82(2), some courts have argued that infringements giving rise to damages are only those involving a \"processing\". Recital 146 sentence 1 GDPR is usually cited in this regard, too, as it states that \u201c the controller or processor should compensate any damage which a person may suffer as a result of processing that infringes this Regulation \u201d. However, this seems to be a weak argument. Article 82 GDPR aims at providing damaged persons with full and effective protection through a compensatory remedy. Limiting such a remedy to infringements that are based on a processing would exclude situations that entail serious negative consequences on the legal position of data subjects, such as unanswered access requests where the lack of a reply hinders the rights and interests of the person requesting the information. The problem here is similar to the one already addressed in the context of Article 77(1) GDPR. Therefore, we refer to that part of this commentary. Article 82(3) GDPR introduces a further prerequisite (\u201c responsible \u201d) for the claim for damages, which should mean something like intent and negligence. Article 82(3) GDPR also contains a reversal of the burden of proof with regard to \u201c responsibility \u201d. Responsibility is presumedition The purely dogmatic dispute as to whether the provision should rather be qualified as strict liability with the possibility of exculpation is practically irrelevant and can be left aside. [ 27 ] Only if the controller or processor proves (i.e. bears the full burden of proof) that they are not responsible \u201c in any way \" for the damage that has occurred, there is exceptionally no liability. This is confirmed by Recital 146 sentence 2 GDPR. The examples listed by Zanfir-Fortuna in which responsibility should be omitted seem incorrect. [ 28 ] The first example given is: \u201c Controllers prove that they are not controllers of the unlawful processing \u201d. If this proof succeeds, the proving party would already not be considered as a controller. The second example (which is a mirror image of the third example) is also unconvincing: \u201c Damage was caused by a processor acting outside of or contrary to the mandate received by the controller \u201d. Here, too, the liability requirement of Article 82(2) GDPR would already cease to apply (especially if the controller could not foresee or control the processor\u2019s wrongdoing) so that without Article 82(3) GDPR, a claim for damages would not come into consideration. Moreover, this view is not convincing from the point of view of creditor protection (see in detail under (2) Involvement, causality and special liability requirements for processors) . These examples suggest that Zanfir-Fortuna understands Article 82(3) GDPR as a general reversal of the burden of proof to paragraphs 1 and 2, which is not the case (see above Burden of Proof ). Nemitz points out that the exemption from liability only applies if the respective controller or processor can prove a fault rate of 0 percent. In practice, this means that either there must not be a causal connection between the violation of the GDPR and the damage or that the violation is only based on an unavoidable event. [ 29 ] The liability system of Article 82(4) and (5) GDPR must be applied to everything else because of the otherwise unfairly distributed insolvency risk (see previous paragraph). Article 82(4) GDPR contains a special rule for the case where there are several damaging parties (cf. also Recital 146 sentence 7 GDPR). The provision contains the addition at the end \u201c in order to ensure effective compensation of the data subject \u201d. Therefore, the provision itself contains a justification that has become substantive law. In this respect, it must be considered even more sharply in interpreting the provision than, for example, the intention of the legislature, which can only be inferred from recitals or other regulatory material. The provision must therefore be interpreted in a particularly damaged-party friendly and thus broad manner. According to Article 82(4) GDPR, each damaging party is liable for the entire damage suffered by the damaged party. This means that in the external relationship there are no restrictions based on the level of \u201c involvement \u201d in the respective processing. All damaging parties are liable without limitation as joint debtors. This also corresponds to the aforementioned regulatory background of the provision. The damaged party's chances of compensation are increased by the increase in the number of persons liable (lower risk of insolvency). The compensation in the internal relationship is regulated in Article 82(5) GDPR. It is the sole decision of the damaged party whether to claim one damaging parties or all of them. [ 30 ] The provision clarifies that it is irrelevant whether several controllers and processors, or a mixture of both are involved in the processing leading to damage. This makes it clear that the processor is not liable in a subsidiary manner to the controller. The \u201c involvement \u201d corresponds to that of Article 82(2) GDPR. However, for a majority of the damaging parties to exist at all, the aforementioned requirements of Article 82(2) and (3) GDPR must be fulfilled in addition to the \u201c involvement \u201d. The meaning of Recital 146 sentence 8 GDPR is uncertain. Proportionate judicial recourse to the damaging parties seems to contradict Article 82(4) GDPR, according to which all damaging parties are liable for the full amount. Moreover, the application of the provision presupposes that a pro rata claim against joint damaging parties is possible at all. In this respect, Bergt correctly points out that a pro rata conviction is only justifiable if the joint conviction takes effect immediately if a party convicted pro rata does not pay voluntarily within a short period of time. This is because the expense of enforcement measures against several damaging parties, possibly even abroad, stands in the way of effective and complete compensation. [ 31 ] Article 82(5) GDPR also regulates the compensation of damages paid in the case of multiple damaging parties. However, this paragraph addresses the problem from the angle of the internal relationship between damaging parties. As seen, all damaging parties can be held liable for the entire damage in the external relationship (Article 82(4) GDPR). In the internal relationship, however, the damaging parties should only be liable proportionally proportionally to their involvement in the unlawful activity, as otherwise there would be material injustice. This is why the person who has been held liable can demand compensation from the other damaging parties. This idea is also reflected in Recital 146 sentence 9 GDPR, which mentions \u2018 recourse proceedings \u2019 against other controllers or processors involved in the same processing. In this context, it is once again established that \u2013 not differently from Article 82(4) GDPR \u2013 processors and controllers are on the same level in terms of liability, even within their internal relationship. The only differentiation stems from their different obligations under the material part of the GDPR and the controller-processor agreement pursuant to Article 28 GDPR. Article 82(6) GDPR states that claims for damages must be brought before courts and therefore they are not determined by the supervisory authorities. For the respective jurisdiction of the courts, reference is made to Article 79(2) GDPR (see also the respective commentary). \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 82 GDPR \u2191 CJEU, Case C\u2011300/21, \u00d6sterreichische Post , 4 May 2023, margin number 32 (available here ). \u2191 Zanfir-Fortuna , in Kuner et al., The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Article 82 GDPR, p. 1162, 1164, 1175.

Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to this Article in respect of infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 shall in each individual case be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. 2.   Administrative fines shall, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, be imposed in addition to, or instead of, measures referred to in points (a) to (h) and (j) of Article 58(2). When deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and deciding on the amount of the administrative fine in each individual case due regard shall be given to the following: 3.   If a controller or processor intentionally or negligently, for the same or linked processing operations, infringes several provisions of this Regulation, the total amount of the administrative fine shall not exceed the amount specified for the gravest infringement. 4.   Infringements of the following provisions shall, in accordance with paragraph 2, be subject to administrative fines up to 10 000 000 EUR, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 2\u00a0% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher: 5.   Infringements of the following provisions shall, in accordance with paragraph 2, be subject to administrative fines up to 20 000 000 EUR, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 4\u00a0% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher: 6.   Non-compliance with an order by the supervisory authority as referred to in Article 58(2) shall, in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article, be subject to administrative fines up to 20 000 000 EUR, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 4\u00a0% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. 7.   Without prejudice to the corrective powers of supervisory authorities pursuant to Article 58(2), each Member State may lay down the rules on whether and to what extent administrative fines may be imposed on public authorities and bodies established in that Member State. 8.   The exercise by the supervisory authority of its powers under this Article shall be subject to appropriate procedural safeguards in accordance with Union and Member State law, including effective judicial remedy and due process. 9.   Where the legal system of the Member State does not provide for administrative fines, this Article may be applied in such a manner that the fine is initiated by the competent supervisory authority and imposed by competent national courts, while ensuring that those legal remedies are effective and have an equivalent effect to the administrative fines imposed by supervisory authorities. In any event, the fines imposed shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Those Member States shall notify to the Commission the provisions of their laws which they adopt pursuant to this paragraph by 25 May 2018 and, without delay, any subsequent amendment law or amendment affecting them. Article 83 GDPR introduces the administrative fine and designates the supervisory authority (\u201c SA \u201d) for its application. Each decision on the administrative fine must be done on a case-by-case basis. In particular, the SA shall decide whether an administrative fine is to be imposed and what its amount should be. To do so, Article 83 GPDR contains a non-exhaustive list of criteria. In any case, the fine must be effective, dissuasive and proportionate. Moreover, an explicit duty to provide adequate procedural safeguards is introduced. Finally, for jurisdictions that do not provide or otherwise admit administrative fines, a duty to introduce equally effective instruments is foreseen. In order to provide procedural consistency among different SAs in a field that directly affects controllers' rights, the EDPB adopted its Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR (hereinafter \"the EDPB Guidelines\"). Paragraph 1 establishes the obligation of the SA to impose an administrative fine when the controller commits an infringement referred to in the subsequent paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 of  Article 83. The fine must be, in each individual case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The basic requirement for a fine is an \" infringement \" of the provisions listed in Article 83(4), (5) and (6) GDPR. [ 1 ] This specifically refers to violations of Articles 8, 11, 25 to 39, 41(4), 42, 43 of the GDPR (paragraph 4), Articles 5, 6, 7, and 9, 12 to 22, 44 to 49, 58(1)(e) and (f), 58(2)(f) and (j) of the GDPR, as well as any breaches of Member State laws adopted under Chapter IX (paragraph 5), and non-compliance with any other orders issued under Article 58(2) of the GDPR (paragraph 6). Although the GDPR refers to the concept of \" infringement \" as a starting point for the adoption of a fine and its quantification, the existence of one or more infringement(s) necessarily implies the existence of (at least) a sanctionable \" conduct \". According to the EDPB, the difference between \" conduct \" and \" infringement \" is relevant because a single sanctionable conduct can give rise to multiple infringements. [ 2 ] A \" sanctionable conduct \" is an action consisting of a single processing operation or \u201c linked processing operations \u201d. [ 3 ] In a simple case, a single sanctionable conduct can obviously cause a single infringement. Example : XXX However, one sanctionable conduct can also produce multiple infringements. In such case, two situations may arise. In a first scenario, it may be that the concurring infringements preclude each other (\u201c apparent concurrence \u201d or \u201c false concurrence \u201d) due to the principles of specialty, subsidiarity or consumption. In other words, different GDPR provisions pursue partially overlapping goals. In this case, the SA will have to identify the common rationale behind the provisions and adopt only one fine on the basis of the infringement that is most specific to the facts at issue. EDPB : The principle of concurrence of offences (also referred to as \u201capparent concurrence\u201d or \u201cfalse concurrence\u201d) applies wherever the application of one provision precludes or subsumes the applicability of the other. In other words, concurrence occurs already on the abstract level of statutory provisions. This could either be on grounds of the principle of specialty, subsidiarity or consumption, which often apply where provisions protect the same legal interest. In such cases, it would be unlawful to sanction the offender for the same wrongdoing twice. [ 4 ] In a second scenario, different infringements may be applicable alongside each other (\" unity of action \u201d). In this second case, as principles of specialty, subsidiarity and consumption do not apply, the controller violates with a single conduct provisions that have different purposes. Thus, the SA will have to issue separate fines, which nevertheless could not exceed the amount specified for the gravest infringement, as specified by Article 83(3). [ 5 ] Example : XXX In case of multiple sanctionable conducts - i.e. different sets of processing operation without any substantial link with each other - the sanctioning procedure is governed by the principle of \"plurality of actions\" (\" factual concurrence \" or \" coincidental concurrence \"). The only reason why a DPA deals with these conducts in the same proceeding is administrative efficiency. Different fines should be adopted and the overall amount may exceed the amount specified for the gravest infringement, as Article 83(3) does not apply. [ 6 ] Example : XXX When one or more infringements exist, the SA shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines is effective, proportionate and dissuasive. [ 7 ] This triad of requirements should be seen as the guiding principle not only for the issuing of a fine (Recitals 151 sentence 4 and 152 sentence 1 GDPR) but also for other types of sanctions, according to Article 84(1)(2) GDPR. The elements of effectiveness and dissuasiveness cannot be clearly distinguished from each other. [ 8 ] The term \u201c dissuasive \u201d means that the fine shall have a preventive function, specifically towards the sanctioned party. However, according to the GDPR's overriding objective of effectiveness, the fine is also intended to pursue general prevention objectives. [ 9 ] To be dissuasive, the fine must be so severe that the person responsible will refrain from further infringements, especially infringements of the same nature. Furthermore, the fine alone must ensure effective sanctioning of data protection violations with sufficient dissuasive effect. In particular, this prohibits the SAs from making the assessment of the amount of the fine dependent on or coordinated with any claims for damages under Article 82 GDPR. Otherwise, the effectiveness of the fine would no longer be ensured. [ 10 ] The terms \u201c dissuasive \u201d and \u201c effective \u201d also introduce a lower limit for the fine. It must not be merely symbolic in nature. [ 11 ] The principle of proportionality, enshrined in EU primary law in Article 5(4) TEU and Article 52(1)(2) CFR, is also reflected in Article 83(1) GDPR. [ 12 ] In general, a measure is proportionate if it pursues a legitimate aim, it is suitable and necessary to achieve this aim and the measure is also appropriate. The administrative fine implies an economic loss for the sanctioned company. Therefore, the economic capacity of companies must be taken into account and used as a basis for orientation. [ 13 ] The EDPB stresses that at least three main elements should be considered in this regard. First, economic viability of the company plays a role in performing a proportionality test. Thus, the undertaking subject to the fine should provide detailed financial data (for more information on the term 'undertaking' see commentary on paragraph 4 below). The simple fact that the undertaking is (or will be after the fine) in a poor financial situation does not necessarily mean that the fine is disproportionate. Second, an actual proof of value loss  is required. In other words, to reduce the fine in light of proportionality, the value loss of the undertaking assets shall be proved, including the causal link between fine and loss. Finally, the specific social and economic context is also relevant. This third element concerns broader circumstances external to the undertaking, such as the fact that economy is going through a cyclical crisis. [ 14 ] \"The concept of \u2018undertaking\u2019 must also be taken into account in order to assess the actual or material economic capacity of the recipient of the fine and thus to ascertain whether the fine is at the same time effective, proportionate and dissuasive\" CJEU - C\u2011383/23 - ILVA , margin number 36. Under Article 83(2) GDPR, administrative fines shall, \u201c depending on the circumstances of each individual case, be imposed in addition to, or instead of, measures referred to in points (a) to (h) and (j) of Article 58(2) \u201d. The provision further stipulates that \u201c when deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and deciding on the amount of the administrative fine in each individual case due regard shall be given \u201d to certain criteria included in a list. [ 15 ] Article 83(2) GDPR regulates the relationship between the administrative fine and other measures under Article 58(2) GDPR. Fines should be imposed either \u201c in addition to \u201d or \u201c instead of \u201d these measures. It is clear from this wording that a fine can either substitute or reinforce a corrective measures provided for in the GDPR. Article 83(2) sentence 2 GDPR grants the competent SA a so-called intended discretionary decision (\u201c whether \u201d to impose a fine) as well as a discretionary choice regarding its amount. The provision lists a non-exhaustive set of criteria to carry out the task (see below). The SA must first decide whether to impose a fine at all. This follows from the wording of Article 83(2) GDPR, which is unambiguous in this respect (\u201c when deciding whether to impose a fine \u201d). [ 16 ] The discretionary power granted in this respect is limited. In making its considerations and reaching its conclusions, the SA must take into account certain criteria listed in Article 83(2)(a)-(k) GDPR [ 17 ] . Such criteria will also assist in quantifying the amount of the fine (see below). [ 18 ] The criteria outlined in Article 83(2)(a-k) and explained below guide the SA in the decision on \" whether \" to impose a fine and determining its \" amount \". In general terms, these criteria can be classified into two broad categories: objective criteria related to the severity of the infringement and subjective criteria for assessing the conduct of the offender. [ 19 ] The catalogue of assessment criteria is not exhaustive. As a matter of fact, Article 83(2)(k) GDPR contains an explicit catch-all provision. [ 20 ] By introducing letter (k), the legislator has made it clear that the assessment criteria are not exhaustively listed. The significance of criteria that are not explicitly mentioned is rather to be measured according to general legal methodology, in particular by a systematical comparison with the listed criteria. [ 21 ] The individual criteria are listed and commented in the following: The elements of this criterion are self-explanatory. The term \u201c damage \u201d is likely to be synonymous with the term used in Article 82 GDPR. It also follows explicitly that the civil liability for damages or its successful enforcement should not lead to a reduction of the fine (rather the opposite). This criterion concerns the subjective compenent of the assessment. Like in criminal law, the more the infringement was intentional, the higher the sanction. With the help of this provision, the extent to which the controller or processor has acted responsibly after the occurrence of a violation, in particular whether and which remedial measures they have taken, can be assessed in a mitigating and aggravating manner. [ 22 ] As a rule, voluntary compensation for damage can only be taken into account in a way that mitigates the penalty. Such compensation can (indirectly) constitute an admission of guilt, so that a violation of the nemo tenetur principle can be present if the lack of compensation is taken into account. This criterion is intended to penalise technical negligence in data protection or the lack of special preventive measures. For the technical and organisational measures, reference is made to the commentary on Article 25 and Article 32 GDPR. This criterion can be considered a further specification of lett. (b). On the one hand, this criterion is intended in particular to ensure that repeat offenders receive higher penalties in order to ensure the dissuasive effect of the fine. The wording, on the other hand, does not allow for a reduction of the penalty for first-time offenders. However, SAs may take this into account in the context of letter Article 83(2)(k) GDPR. This criterion has similarities with letter (c), as it also depends on positive (insightful) post-offense behaviour. However, it must be taken into account that an official measure was required to persuade the person responsible to a positive post-offense behaviour. In addition, the nemo tenetur principle must be taken into account here. This criterion first takes into account the importance of the special categories of personal data within the meaning of Article 9 GDPR. The special protection of Article 10 GDPR should also be taken into account when assessing fines.\u00a0 However, this criterion should also allow for higher fines in case of types of data that do not fall under Articles 9, 10. Thus, other data, especially of financial nature, may be objectively or subjectively sensitive and justify an increased penalty. Here, too, a basic principle of criminal law is reflected, according to which a voluntary notification of an infringement should in principle lead to a mitigation of the penalty. Inversely, the nemo tenetur principle must also be sufficiently taken into account here. As a rule, the application of this criterion is likely to result in an increase in penalties. If the controller or processor has already been subject to measures under Article 58(2) GDPR, the controller or processor is forewarned and should already be induced to adapt its behaviour. However, this criterion is only applicable to a limited extent if a fine is imposed under Article 83(5) Var. 1 or (6) GDPR, as otherwise there could be a violation of ne bis in idem . First, it follows from this criterion that a fine may also be imposed even if the conduct leading to the infringement complied with approved codes of conduct. The more specific the approved code of conduct and the closer the infringement to be punished is to this code of conduct, the less this criterion may be taken into account. Otherwise, there would be a violation of the prohibition of contradictory conduct by the SA. The approval of codes of conduct establishes a certain trust worthy of protection on the part of the controller or processor. The last criterion listed contains a catch-all provision. Please refer to the above comments on the non-exhaustive nature of the criteria. According to Recital 150 sentence 4 GDPR, the \u201c general level of income in the Member State \u201d and the \u201c economic situation of the person \u201d should also be pondered when assessing fines on persons who are not undertakings. There is no doubt that these criteria can also be taken into account under letter Article 83(2)(k) GDPR. Moreover, these criteria must be considered anyway in the context of the proportionality principle, which must always be carried out pursuant to Article 83(1) GDPR. [ 23 ] \"Those factors characterise either the behaviour of that controller or processor, accused of infringements of certain provisions of the GDPR, or the infringements themselves. They therefore serve to ensure that each of those infringements is assessed on the basis of all the relevant individual circumstances and that the objectives pursued by the system of penalties provided for in the GDPR are achieved. Although those factors do not make reference to the concept of an undertaking, within the meaning of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, the Court has already ruled that only a fine which takes into account not just all of the factors thus characterising the established infringements of the GDPR, but also, where appropriate, the actual or material economic capacity of the person on which the fine is imposed is capable of satisfying the three conditions set out in Article 83(1) of the GDPR, namely to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. In order to assess those conditions, it is necessary to take account of whether that person forms part of an undertaking, within the meaning of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU. CJEU - C\u2011383/23 - ILVA , margin number 28 et seq. with further references. This part of Article 83 concerns the principle of \"unity of action\" (see above). With Article 83(3) GDPR, the legislator has decided in favour of the principle of absorption and against the principle of accumulation for processing operations that are identical or linked. For example, \u201c if there is an infringement of Articles 8 and 12, the graver assessment under Article 83(5) will be triggered by Article 12. Thus, Article 83 does not support the principle of accumulation of penalties but rather adheres to the principle of absorption, under which a SA has to decide which infringement is the most serious one and calculate the fine for it, and then determine the fine based on the number of infringements \u201d. [ 24 ] The term \u201c linked \u201d is to be understood narrowly. Any other interpretation would open up potential for abuse by artificially linking processing operations. Otherwise, the protective purpose of the provision to ensure consistent enforcement of the GDPR through dissuasion would be weakened. Nemitz correctly points out that such a fine must then in any case be higher pursuant to Article 83(2)(a) GDPR because of the multiple infringements in contrast to where only a single infringement had been committed in an individual case. [ 25 ] Article 83(4) GDPR specifies a set of infringements which are subject to a less severe fine. It applies to the following offenses: the obligations of the controller and the processor pursuant to Articles 8, 11, 25 to 39 and 42 and 43 GDPR; the obligations of the certification body pursuant to Articles 42 and 43 GDPR; the obligations of the monitoring body pursuant to Article 41(4) GDPR. [ 26 ] These infringements shall be subject to administrative fines up to \u20ac10 million or, in the case of an undertaking, up to 2\u00a0% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. According to Recital 150, 'undertaking' under this provision should be understood as an undertaking in accordance with Articles 101 and 102 TFEU. \"[F]or the purposes of applying the competition rules, referred to in Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, that concept covers any entity engaged in an economic activity, irrespective of the legal status of that entity and the way in which it is financed. The concept of an undertaking therefore designates an economic unit even if in law that economic unit consists of several persons, natural or legal. That economic unit consists of a unitary organisation of personal, tangible and intangible elements, which pursues a specific economic aim on a long-term basis [...]. Accordingly, it is apparent from Article 83(4) to (6) of the GDPR, which concerns the calculation of administrative fines in respect of the infringements listed in those paragraphs, that, where the addressee of the administrative fine is or forms part of an undertaking, within the meaning of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, the maximum amount of the administrative fine is calculated on the basis of a percentage of the total worldwide annual turnover in the preceding business year of the undertaking concerned [...]. CJEU - C\u2011383/23 - ILVA , margin number 22 et seq. The sum of the annual turnover of all individual persons who are to be understood as an undertaking according to the above definition is to be taken as a basis. Despite some clarifications in the EDPB Guidelines, the GDPR and other EU law do not specify a concrete calculation method. In this respect, the SA should have the prerogative to assess the calculation method, whereby it is obliged to apply it uniformly due to the principle of equal treatment. The SAs should be guided by the existing, largely (internationally) standardised rules for the determination of turnover under tax or accounting law. After all, the multitude of undertakings will calculate these figures anyway so that they can evaluate the amount of potential fines by themselves. Under Article 83(4), there is no lower limit for the fine. There is no provision for deprivation of profits in the case of infringements of the GDPR. However, according to Article 83(2)(k) GDPR, financial benefits gained from the infringement can be considered when deciding on the amount of the administrative fine (see above). Only insofar as Member States enact national regulations on sanctions (cf. Article 84 GDPR), a deprivation of profits is possible according to Recital 149 sentence 1 GDPR. Contrary to the wording, this can take place not only on the basis of criminal law, but also on the basis of administrative law. [ 27 ] Article 83(5) GDPR then contains the more serious infringements, which are punishable by a higher fine. The upper limit of the fine is \u20ac20 million or, in the case of an undertaking, 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover, whichever is higher. Article 83(5) GDPR covers the following offenses: (a) the basic principles for processing, including conditions for consent, pursuant to Articles 5, 6, 7 and 9 GDPR; (b) the data subjects\u2019 rights pursuant to Articles 12 to 22 GDPR; (c) the transfers of personal data to a recipient in a third country or an international organisation pursuant to Articles 44 to 49 GDPR; (d) any obligations pursuant to Member State law adopted under Chapter IX; (e) non-compliance with an order or a temporary or definitive limitation on processing or the suspension of data flows by the SA pursuant to Article 58(2) GDPR or failure to provide access in violation of Article 58(1) GDPR. Article 83(6) GDPR is a superfluous provision and has no independent scope of application. The entire regulatory content of this provision is already covered by Article 83(5)(e) GDPR, which also provides for the same legal consequences. [ 28 ] Article 83(7) GDPR contains an opening clause. Member States may provide by law whether and to what extent fines may also be imposed on public authorities and bodies established in the Member State concerned. From this provision and Recital 150 sentence 6 GDPR, it follows first that the GDPR itself does not directly provide for fines against public authorities and bodies. This clarification is necessary because Article 83 GDPR does not contain a clear description of the addressees of the fines. It predominantly focuses on \"controllers and processors\", which does not exclude public authorities and bodies (cf. Article 4(7) and (8) GDPR). The fact that public authorities and bodies cannot constitute an \u201c undertaking \u201d within the meaning of Article 83(4), (5) and (6) GDPR does not lead to a general exclusion as norm addressee. Thereby, only the relative ground for calculating a fine based on the annual turnover is excluded. The addition of \u201c without prejudice to the corrective powers of SAs as referred to in Article 58(2) \u201d GDPR underlines that the SAs can use those powers also against public authorities and bodies. The usefulness of a fine against public authorities has been debated. After all, a fine against public authorities and bodies may only lead to a shift of financial resources within the public budget. [ 29 ] Nevertheless, the threat of withdrawal of financial resources may also serve as an incentive. Informal statements by data protection officers seem to show that the lack of fines leads to data protection law not being taken seriously by public authorities and bodies, as the responsible employees do not expect any consequences for violations of the law. [ 30 ] However, the problem with fines against public authorities and bodies appears to be that public authorities and bodies, which are fundamentally established in the interest of citizens, lose the resources necessary to fulfill their tasks. It has been rightly pointed out that fines may be necessary at least in the public health sector due to the processing of particularly sensitive personal data and in the public registration system due to the processing of particularly lucrative personal data for control purposes. [ 31 ] The opening clause does not only grant the decision on \"whether\" to impose fines on public authorities and bodies. Rather, the member states are entitled to a completely unguided decision on the amount of fines. Certainly, it should be noted that a link to the fine framework of Article 83(4), (5) and (6) GDPR is unlikely to make much sense. The nature of the administrative fine is not clear. It evidently has an administrative nature because Article 83 GDPR as well as Recital 150 explicitly refer to \u201c administrative fines \u201d on various occasions. [ 32 ] Furthermore, it is adopted by an SA, [ 33 ] which is technically an administrative body. [ 34 ] However, the fine also has elements of criminal law. Admittedly, it cannot be classified as criminal in the narrower sense, as the EU lacks the legislative competence to enact regulations in criminal law. [ 35 ] At the same time, a classification as criminal in the broader sense is appropriate. By applying the criteria set out by the ECHR, scholars conclude that fines are \" criminal within the wider, autonomous meaning of Article 6 ECHR \", but not in the \" criminal \" sense of EU law. [ 36 ] This means that the imposition of fines must in any case respect the core principles of criminal law, e.g. the principles nemo tenetur se ipsum accusare , ne bis in idem and nulla poena sine lege (in particular nulla poena sine lege certa ). However, the application of these criminal law principles to a (formally) administrative sanction cannot necessarily have the same scope they have in the criminal sector. [ 37 ] For these reasons, Article 83(8) requires that appropriate procedural safeguards under Union and Member State law must exist in the sanctioning proceedings. These include in particular effective judicial remedies and due process. [ 38 ] Due process refers to the administrative procedure itself. In this respect, the parties involved should always have the right to express their views, for example through a hearing or a system providing for the submission of defensive pleadings. In addition, the measure should always offer a motivation that explains in detail how the decision on the fine was reached. [ 39 ] In addition, Article 83(8) establishes that the addressee of the fine has a right to challenge the measure before a court. This is particularly important if one considers that administrative fines have an almost-criminal nature, as already stressed above. The provision is appropriately described by Moos, Schefzig as a \u201c mandatory opening clause \u201d. [ 40 ] Article 83(8) GDPR is likely to establish a comprehensive legislative obligation for all Member States, provided that the aforementioned criteria are not yet fulfilled in the respective Member State law. However, no new rules need to be created if the administrative procedure behind the imposition of fines fits into the Member State's administrative law doctrine. In this respect, Article 83(8) GDPR should establish a corresponding obligation of the Member States to check whether this is the case. Article 83(9) GDPR addresses the fact that in some Member States administrative fines are not allowed by law. According to Article 83(9) GDPR, in these cases a modified application of Article 83 GDPR must be made in such a way that a fine is initiated by the SA and imposed by the competent courts. Beyond this, these Member States are generally obliged to apply Article 83 GDPR in full (adapted to the absence of administrative fines). It must be ensured that these remedies are effective and have the same effect as the fines imposed by the SAs. Article 83(9) GDPR emphasises the importance of paragraph (1) once again: The Member States concerned are explicitly obliged to apply the principles of effectiveness, dissuasiveness and proportionality. According to Recital 151 GDPR, these are in any case Denmark and Estonia. In light of a decision of the Slovenian Supreme Court of 16 March 2021, Slovenia seems not to allow for administrative fines either. Finally, Article 83(9) GDPR contains an information (25 May 2018) and update obligation vis-\u00e0-vis the Commission about national legislation adopted in fulfilment of the obligation under Article 83(9) GDPR. The purpose of this provision is that the Commission can also verify and track the effective enforcement of the GDPR in Member States without administrative fines. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 83 GDPR \u2191 The wording \u201c infringements of this Regulation \u201d in Article 83(1) GDPR is slightly imprecise. In fact, Article 83(5)(d) GDPR also provides for fines for breaches of Member State law adopted under Chapter IX. \u2191 The EDPB's interpretation borrows principles from criminal law. Individual (material) facts shall be subsumed under a single (material) conduct due to their intrinsic coherence in terms of will and purposes. That said, even if the sanctionable conduct is only one, it may alternatively give rise to one or multiple infringements. This second stage is the moment when a material conduct is eventually matched with one or multiple legal categories. To continue the parallel with criminal law, this is the phase in which a fact that meets all the elements of the legal type becomes a \"crime\" (or a set of crimes), at least from the objective perspective. The following sub-paragraphs will explain in details the several options that may arise. \u2191 The term \u201clinked\u201d refers to the principle that a unitary conduct might consist of several parts that are carried out by a unitary will and are contextually (in particular, regarding identity in terms of data subject, purpose and nature), spatially and temporally related in such a close way that, from an objective standpoint, they would be considered as one coherent conduct. A sufficient link should not be assumed easily, in order for the supervisory authority to avoid infringement of the principles of deterrence and effective enforcement of European law. See, Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR , par. 28. \u2191 Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR , par. 30. \u2191 Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR , par. 38. \u2191 Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR , par. 46. \u2191 \"This traditional trio of requirements is 'an undefined legal concept' used in various situations of sanctioning under EU law, including case law and secondary legislation\".

Beck 2020, 36th edition). \u2191 Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR , par. 137 and following. \u2191 Sentence 1 is only designed to decide on the relation between corrective measures under Article 58(2) GDPR and the administrative fine under Article 83 GDPR. In other words, whether they can occur simultaneously or not. Sentence 2, on the other hand, is the only provision in Article 83 GDPR that regulates the (different) issue of whether an administrative fine should be imposed or not. See discussion below. \u2191 A view according to which the SA has an absolute obligation to impose a fine must therefore be rejected. The opposing view refers to the wording of Article 83(2)sentence 1 GDPR as well as Article 83(4) and (5) GDPR according to which the SA \u201c shall [...] impose \u201d a fine. This is not convincing. The primary regulatory objective of Article 83(2)(1) GDPR (and of Recital 148 sentence 1 GDPR) is to regulate the relationship of fines to other measures. There is no evidence that the provision is intended to introduce a simultaneous \u201c incidental \u201d obligation to impose fines. Rather, the decision on \u201c whether \u201d and \u201c how \u201d to impose a fine is explicitly regulated in the second sentence. Certainly, this is not completely convincing systematically, since the legislator could have made independent paragraphs out of sentences 1 and 2 in order to support the interpretation adopted here. However, the wording of paragraphs 4 and 5 cannot justify a different interpretation, as they only aim to introduce the catalogue of infringements to be sanctioned and the respective fine frameworks, and explicitly refer to Article 83(2) GDPR for the decision on \u201c whether \u201d and \u201c how \u201d. Having said this, it is also irrelevant that the wording \u201cmay impose fines \u201d initially provided for in the Council draft on Article 83(2)(1) as well as (4) and (5) GDPR was replaced by \u201c shall impose fines \u201d. For more information on this debate, see Bergt , in K\u00fchling, Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 83 GDPR, margin numbers 30 to 32f (C.H.

Beck 2019, 1st edition); Nemitz , in Ehmann, Selmayr, Datenschutz-Grundverordnung, Article 83 GDPR, margin number 14 (C.H. Beck 2018, 2nd edition). \u2191 Recital 148 sentence 2 GDPR, mentions two examples in which the imposition of a fine is to be waived (\" minor infringement \"; \" disproportionate burden to a natural person \"). \u2191 The EDPB recommends in its Guidelines a 5-step procedure for the determination of the administrative fine.\n\nIdentification of processing operations. This first stage involves the identification of sanctionable conduct(s) and infringment(s). For a detailed analysis we refer to paragraph (1).\n\nDetermination of the starting point of calculation. Three main elements shall be taken into account: a) the categorisation of each infringement under either Article 83(4) or Article 83(5)/(6); b) assessment of the seriousness of the infringement pursuant to Article 83(2)(a), (b) and (g). The EDPB stressed that there is no mathematical formula, but three possible outputs are possible, namely low, medium or high level of seriousness; c) determination of the turnover of the undertaking.\n\nApplication of potential aggravating or mitigating factors in light of the criteria provided by Article 83(2), with the exception of letters (a), (b) and (g), which have to be used the previous stage.\n\nIdentification of the legal maximum. As a matter of fact, the EDPB mentions here again Article 83(4)-(6), which also provides criteria for the determination of the starting point.\n\nAssessment of effectiveness, dissuasiveness and proportionality of the measure, with the possibility to increase or decrease the fine accordingly. Concerning this point, we refer to the section \"Further requirements of the fine\" in paragraph (1). \u2191 Tambou , in Spiecker gen.

Kotschy , in Kuner et al., The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Article 83 GDPR, p. 1184 (Oxford University Press 2020). \u2191 The competent body for issuing administrative fines is always the SA. This can be derived from Article 83(1) GDPR (\u201c Each SA shall ensure [...]\u201d). Such power is also confirmed by Article 58(2)(i) GDPR: \u201c Each SA \u201d shall be empowered to impose a fine. Another confirmation in this sense is brought by Recital 150 sentence 1 GDPR. It states that \u201c each SA should have the power to impose administrative fines \u201d in order \u201c to strengthen and harmonise \u201d the application of the GDPR. In order to make this possible at all, each SA must have the power to impose fines. Member States that do not provide for administrative fines are therefore obliged to implement a modified, comparably effective application of Article 83 GDPR. The competence of the SA is determined in accordance with Articles 55 et seq. GDPR. \u2191 Article 55(3) GDPR clarifies that SAs are not considered by the GDPR to belong to the judiciary. \u2191 Holl\u00e4nder , in BeckOK DatenschutzR, Article 83 GDPR, margin number 41 (C.H.

Member States shall lay down the rules on other penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation in particular for infringements which are not subject to administrative fines pursuant to Article 83, and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. Such penalties shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. 2.   Each Member State shall notify to the Commission the provisions of its law which it adopts pursuant to paragraph 1, by 25 May 2018 and, without delay, any subsequent amendment affecting them. Article 84 requires Member States to adopt by national law specific provisions for breaches of the GDPR not subject to the discipline of Article 83 GDPR. Such provisions must also be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Pursuant to Article 84(2) GDPR, Member States are required to communicate such legislative measures to the European Commission. Certain violations of the GDPR are not listed in the catalogue of penalties in Article 83 GDPR. National legislators may add provisions to fill these gaps. Under Recital 152 GDPR, these provisions may either be civil or criminal in nature. For example, \u00a7 62 of the Austrian Data Protection Act (Datenschutzgesetz - DSG) sets a penalty of \u20ac50,000 for, inter alia , (1) intentionally obtaining illegal access to personal data (2) refusing an inspection by the Austrian supervisory authority, (3) operating a CCTV system in violation of the specific rules set out in the Act. In the Netherlands, additional penalty provisions include Article 21a of the Act implementing the GDPR (' Uitvoeringswet Algemene verordening gegevensbescherming '), which permits the supervisory authority to impose an administrative fine of up to \u20ac20 million (or 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover), where the requirements on access by payment service providers to the personal data of their users, established in Article 3.17(7) of the Financial Supervision Act (\u2018 Wet op het financieel toezicht '), are violated. The GDPR can in this way be viewed as an \u201c atypical hybrid of regulation and directive .\u201d [ 1 ] Whilst it establishes an EU-wide penalty regime for violations under Article 83 GDPR, Article 84(1) GDPR dispenses with complete harmonisation. It does, however, provide that any sanctions chosen must be \u2018effective, proportionate, and dissuasive,\u2019 which limits national procedural autonomy to some extent. [ 2 ] Accordingly, rules on sanctions may not make it impossible in practice to exercise rights conferred by EU law, [ 3 ] and must be sufficiently preventative, meaning use is made of the possibility of imposing them across Europe. [ 4 ] The extent to which conduct under Article 83 GDPR should be excluded from penalties issued under Article 84 GDPR is debated. Whilst the wording of the GDPR is simply unclear in this regard, [ 5 ] some scholars suggest the existence of a penalty for conduct under Article 83 GDPR should not be seen to preclude a further penalty under Article 84 GDPR.\u00a0 For example, in cases where Member States lay down criminal provisions under Article 84 GDPR, de Hert and Boulet argue that, this \u201c[ allows ] an approach where the criminal is only used when the administrative fails. \u201d [ 6 ] Others note that the words \u201c in particular\u201d in Article 84(1) GDPR (\u201c Member States shall lay down other penalties [\u2026] in particular for infringements which are not subject to administrative fines pursuant to Article 83 \u201d) support such a view. [ 7 ] In contrast, Mountain highlights the phrase \u201c other penalties \u201d (\u201c Member States shall lay down the rules on other penalties \u201d), which would exclude all sanctions mentioned in Chapter VIII GDPR, i.e. the damages under Article 82 GDPR and fines under Article 83 GDPR. [ 8 ] In any case, should fines for conduct falling under the two articles overlap, the principle of ne bis in idem , further discussed in the section below, must be taken into account. Many illegal processing activities under the GDPR may give rise to violations of national criminal laws that are specific to data processing or have broader application (e.g. laws on cybersecurity, fraud and alike). For example, under \u00a7 63 of the Austrian Data Protection Act, individuals who, with the intention of enriching themselves or a third party, deliberately use personal data that have been entrusted to them due to their professional occupation, or which they have illegally acquired, to financially benefit themselves or a third party, may be punished with imprisonment of up to one year. According to Recital 149 GDPR, the imposition of criminal penalties for infringements of national rules on criminal penalties under Article 84 GDPR should not lead to a breach of the principle of ne bis idem , as interpreted by the CJEU. This principle, derived from Article 50 CFR, establishes the right to not be tried and punished twice in criminal proceedings for the same criminal offence. As Lynskey notes, the administrative fines under Article 83 GDPR can likely be classified as criminal in nature. Thus, compliance with Article 50 CFR may be threatened where a criminal sanction is issued under Article 84 for the same conduct. [ 9 ] Eurojust has noted the potential that the ne bis in idem principle may also be engaged at a transnational level, and Member States should consider criminal sanctions issued in other Member States. [ 10 ] Each Member State shall notify to the Commission the provisions of its law which it adopts pursuant to Article 84(1) GDPR, by 25 May 2018 and, without delay, any subsequent amendment affecting them. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 84 GDPR \u2191 K\u00fchling , Martini , Die Datenschutz-Grundverordnung: Revolution oder Evolution im europ\u00e4ischen un deutschen Datenschutzrecht?, Article 84 GDPR, margin numbers 448-449 (C.H.

Member States shall by law reconcile the right to the protection of personal data pursuant to this Regulation with the right to freedom of expression and information, including processing for journalistic purposes and the purposes of academic, artistic or literary expression. 2.   For processing carried out for journalistic purposes or the purpose of academic artistic or literary expression, Member States shall provide for exemptions or derogations from CHAPTER II (principles), CHAPTER III (rights of the data subject), CHAPTER IV (controller and processor), CHAPTER V (transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations), CHAPTER VI (independent supervisory authorities), CHAPTER VII (cooperation and consistency) and CHAPTER IX (specific data processing situations) if they are necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with the freedom of expression and information. 3.   Each Member State shall notify to the Commission the provisions of its law which it has adopted pursuant to paragraph 2 and, without delay, any subsequent amendment law or amendment affecting them. The GDPR provides for stringent requirements when personal data is processed. It is required, among other things, to have a legal basis for each processing operation (Article 6, 9 or 10 GDPR), answer requests from data subjects, including erasure requests (Article 17 GDPR) and to delete personal data when they are longer necessary, in accordance with the storage limitation principle (Article 5(1)(e) GDPR). In other words, the processing of personal data is not an activity which can be taken lightly. This, in turn, may have a negative impact on the circulation of information, and therefore on freedom of expression. For some actors having limited resources indeed, such as artists, independent journalists, or simple citizens, complying with the GDPR may become too challenging, and therefore deter them from expressing themselves. In other instances, the stringent obligations imposed by the GDPR, such as the obligation to inform data subjects (Article 12 to 14 GDPR), may defeat the very purpose of the processing, such as when a whistle-blower intends to disclose classified information, or when a journalist investigates fraudulent actions. Article 85 provides guidance to Member States on how to reconcile the different interests at stake in order to ensure that freedom of expression is not unduly restricted following the application of data protection rules. From the point of legislative history, Article 85 GDPR is a development of Article 9 of the 95/46 directive of the European Union. Article 9 obliged Member States to provide derogations from the directive for the processing of personal data carried out solely for journalistic purposes or the purpose of artistic and literary expression, and only if they are necessary to reconcile the right to privacy with the rights governing freedom of expression. Article 85 GDPR goes beyond this provision by removing the \u2018solely\u2019. One of the first landmark cases before the CJEU which highlighted potential conflicts between data protection law and freedom of expression was Lindqvist . [ 1 ] Mrs Lindqvist was an active member of Alseda, a small community in Sweden. At the end of 1998, she set up internet pages on her personal computer to disseminate information on the local activities. These pages also contained personal information on Mrs Lindqvist as well as other people in the community, including their first and sometimes full names. Mrs Lindqvist also described the work done by some of her colleagues and their hobbies, their family circumstances or their telephone number. She also mentioned that one of her colleagues had injured her foot and was working part-time. Following a complaint against Mrs Lindqvist at the national level, the latter was fined SEK 4000 (approximately EUR 450) by the Swedish DPA for not complying with the applicable data protection legislation. Mrs Lindqvist appealed that decision, and in the context of these proceedings, the national court referred several questions to the CJEU. One of these questions directly addressed the need to achieve a balance between the exercise of Mrs Lindqvist\u2019s freedom of expression and the right to privacy and data protection of the others. In this respect, the CJEU considered that the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive (the GDPR\u2019s predecessor) do not necessarily bring a restriction which conflicts with the general principles of freedom of expression, but it is up to the national courts to ensure a fair balance between the rights and interests in question. [ 2 ] In the specific case, Mrs. Lindqvist's freedom of expression in her work to contribute to the local religious life had to be weighed against the protection of individual rights. To balance these two, the court emphasised on the importance of respecting the principle of proportionality that means taking into account all the circumstances of the case before it before making a decision. [ 3 ] In line with this case law, Article 85 GDPR requires Member States to adopt exemptions at the national level to achieve a balance between data protection on the one side, and freedom of expression and information on the other side, including processing for journalistic purposes and the purposes of academic, artistic or literary expression. These exemptions should allow journalists, academics, artists and writers to fulfil their respective social function without being unduly burdened by data protection rules. Article 85(1) GDPR sets out a legal framework to reconcile the data subject\u2019s right to data protection with the performance of the equally crucial interest of providing society with free, informed and impartial information (regardless of whether it refers to journalistic, scientific, artistic or literary expression). What this \u201c reconciliation \u201d consists of is mostly a matter of necessity, as specified in Article 85(2) GDPR, discussed below. In general, Article 85(1) should be interpreted as a regulatory mandate for member states to to reconcile the rights to data protection with the rights to freedom of expression and information. [ 4 ] Article 85(2) sets out the implementation requirements for 85(1) to be fulfilled. While not outlined, the academic commentary agrees that Article 85(1) should not be read as requiring member states to reconcile data protection with freedom of expression and information in areas which are not linked to the purposes outlined in Article 85(2). [ 5 ] Under Article 85(2) GDPR, when processing is carried out for journalistic purposes or the purpose of academic, artistic or literary expression, Member States shall provide for exemptions or derogations from Chapter II (principles), Chapter III (rights of the data subject), Chapter IV (controller and processor), Chapter V (transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations), Chapter VI (independent supervisory authorities), Chapter VII (cooperation and consistency) and Chapter IX (specific data processing situations) where necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with the freedom of expression and information [ 6 ] The extent of what is \"necessary\" for this purpose is necessarily a matter of interpretation by the national and European courts. In Google Spain , the CJEU clarified the relationship between data protection and freedom of information. According to this judgment, national courts must balance the sensitivity of the information with the public interest in knowing it. [ 7 ] Equally relevant to this issue is the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) on the interpretation of the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights (the Convention). [ 8 ] The ECtHR's case-law has consistently recognised the role of the press for the proper functioning of a democratic society. In this sense, the media not only serve as \u201c public watchdog \u201d but also contribute to the production and circulation of information and ideas in the public interest. The ECtHR has notably stated that \u201c[f] reedom of the press gives politicians the opportunity to reflect and comment on the preoccupations of public opinion; it thus enables everyone to participate in the free political debate which is at the very core of the concept of a democratic society \u201d. Furthermore, the ECtHR has consistently made clear that the right to privacy and the right to freedom of expression \u201c are equal rights that states must balance, based on the criteria the Court has identified in its case law \u201d. [ 9 ] Further, in Von Hannover v. Germany , the ECtHR found that two photographs depicting a royal family on holiday and publishing their reportage in two German newspapers violated the right to privacy pursuant to Article 8 of the Convention because they did not reflect any matter of public interest detailed in the accompanying text. However, a third photograph depicted \u201c a Prince in poor health, and since the health of the Prince was a matter of public concern, the ECtHR found that the publication of such information did not violate Article 8 of the Convention \u201d. In reaching its decision, the ECtHR set out the criteria which domestic courts should follow when balancing the right to privacy against the right to freedom of expression: \u201c firstly, whether the information contributes to a debate of general interest; secondly, how well known the person concerned and the subject matter of the report is; thirdly, the prior conduct of the person concerned; fourthly, content, the form and consequences of the publication; and fifth, the circumstances in which the photos were taken \u201d. [ 10 ] As mentioned above, the GDPR recognises the need to protect freedom of expression (whatever the form) and authorises Member States to adopt, where necessary, statutory derogations to a large part of the GDPR itself, including data processing principles, data subject's rights, rules on international transfers, and even the subjection to the scrutiny of the supervisory authorities. Much (if not everything) seems to be abstractly possible in order to protect freedom of expression. On this point, we note that this favourable treatment does not extend to the protection of national security, defence, or other important objectives of general public interest listed in Article 23 GDPR (to which we refer for a complete analysis of the relevant discipline). National security, for example, can in some instances be invoked as a ground to derogate from the GDPR, but only with respect to the data subject's rights, and only on the condition that such a restriction \"respects the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms\" and is \"necessary and proportionate [...] in a democratic society\" . Conversely, when freedom of expression (including artistic, literary or academic expression) is taken into account, the GDPR envisages much broader exemptions to its own rules. Thus, it seems that the GDPR restrictions justified by overriding interests such as national security, defence, and crime prevention ( Article 23(1)(a-j) GDPR ) allow for far fewer GDPR restrictions than those granted by freedom of expression. Article 85(2) GDPR poses one condition for exemptions on the basis of freedom of expression to be valid: they must be \" necessary to reconcile \" the right to the protection of personal data with the freedom of expression and information. Member States may thus restrict the scope of a data protection principle, limit the exercise of a right by a data subject, or reduce the obligations of controllers, only if this is necessary to achieve a reconciliation between the GDPR and the freedoms of expression and information, including academic, artistic or literary expression. Some commentators rightfully note that the exemption must in any case be justified by a communication purpose. For example, a proportionate exemption will rightfully apply to an artistic photo meant for an exhibition, but not to the data of buyers that the art gallery holds for its economic activity. [ 11 ] Indeed, in the latter case the exemption is not necessary to safeguard the artist\u2019s freedom of artistic expression, but only to allow the art gallery to maintain an economic advantage. Beyond this, Article 85(2) GDPR seems to leave full discretion to Member States to determine in which circumstances a reconciliation is necessary, and how it can be achieved. The approach adopted at the national level therefore varies from one Member State to another. Some have provided some details on the scope of these exemptions in their national data protection law (as in the Belgian data protection law). [ 12 ] This concept is also reflected in Article 52 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Article 52(1) states; \u201cAny limitation on the exercise of the rights and freedoms recognised by this Charter must be provided for by law and respect the essence of those rights and freedoms. Subject to the principle of proportionality, limitations may be made only if they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d Thus, both Article 52 of the Charter alongside Article 85 of the GDPR sets limits on how member states may reconcile the right to freedom of expression and information. Since freedom of expression (Article 11 and 13) and data privacy (Article 8) are both in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, it would run counter to the equal ranking of the fundamental rights to data protection, freedom of expression and information if Member States would provide unnecessary derogations. [ 13 ] This necessity principle can therefore be seen as a way to ensure that the rights are actively balanced. Blanket exemptions from the GDPR in the fields of journalism, academia, arts and literature are not in line with Union Law. [ 14 ] The first question on journalistic expression concerns the scope of the concept of 'expression'. [ 15 ] In general, there seems to be a sort of overlap between the notion of 'expression' and that of 'journalism'. Thus, theoretically the privilege stemming from (the national implementation of) Article 85 GDPR would therefore only be granted to those who qualify as journalists. In theory, this approach may pose considerable problems for those who are not professional journalists. In practice, however, the problem loses part of its relevance. Recital clarifies that the privilege does not only apply to the classic professional press, [ 16 ] but also to the audio-visual sector, i.e. television and radio, as well as for news and press archives. In addition, people without journalistic training also benefit from the exemption insofar as they carry out investigative research activities. [ 17 ] In fact, according to Recital 153 GDPR the term 'journalism' is to be interpreted broadly. Journalistic purposes are not limited to data processing by media corporations but rather any person engaging in journalistic purposes. Processing for journalistic purposes includes data processing which is in connection with the expression of an opinion or aimed at creating one within the public. According to AG Kokott information is in the public interest if it either related to a current public debate, public hearings before a tribunal, transparency of public life or information on the ideas and attitudes, as well as conduct, of prominent politicians. [ 18 ] However, data processing carried out for purposes that are not primarily aimed at informing the public is not privileged. For example, the handling of suppliers or employee data for technical or administrative reasons is not covered by Article 85 GDPR. [ 19 ] Similarly, in line with the Lindqvist case-law discussed above, an individual sharing personal data on social media will still be subject to the provisions of the GDPR, except if the sharing of such information participates to a public debate and is covered by freedom of expression, or if it is shared in the course of a purely personal or household activity (for example, in a closed message group). [ 20 ] There does seem to be a minimum standard to journalistic purposes as at least some journalistic, academic, artistic editing or treatment of the data is necessary to qualify. The mere provision of lists of addresses, address books and, telephone or classified directories does not justify an exemption or derogation. [ 21 ] From a systematic point of view, artistic, literary or academic expression seem to be equated with journalistic expression (as seen above). For this reason, in the absence of more specific indications from both the CJEU and ECtHR, it seems reasonable to apply the same conclusions and principles to these sectors. In this vein, the exemption would be valid for a photo, book or article containing personal data, but only if it is intended to be published, for example, in an art gallery, library or scientific journal. Conversely, data processing carried out by the photographer, writer or academic which is not intended for public discussion (e.g. the record of the gallery's customers) will not fall within the scope of the exception. This nonetheless obviously depends on the national implementation of Article 85 GDPR. At present, not all Member States have specific legislation on artistic, literary or academic expression. [ 22 ] This contributes in no small measure to the uncertainties surrounding the processing of personal data in these areas. This concept is also echoed in Article 13 Charter of Fundamental Rights. In fact, \u201c[the] right is deduced primarily from the right to freedom of thought and expression.\u201d [ 23 ] Each Member State has the obligation to notify the Commission of the provisions of national law which were adopted pursuant to Article 85(2) GDPR and, without delay, any subsequent amendment(s) affecting them. The actual national transposition of these exemptions must immediately be notified to the Commission. Indeed, there is a need for monitoring the exemption measures adopted by each Member States to ensure that the latter have complied with the principle set out in Article 85 GDPR. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 85 GDPR \u2191 CJEU, Case C-101/01 Lindqvist , 6 November 2003 (available here ). \u2191 CJEU, Case C-101/01 Lindqvist , 6 November 2003, margin number 90. \u2191 CJEU, Case C-101/01 Lindqvist , 6 November 2003, margin number 99. \u2191 Spiecker et al., GDPR Article-by-Article Commentary (2023), p 1075. \u2191 Spiecker et al., GDPR Article-by-Article Commentary (2023), p 1074. For example, a proposal by the European Parliament to impose a duty on Member States to balance data protection and freedom of expression and information independent of any specific purposes of processing was not adopted. \u2191 \u201c The exemption under the Directive was narrower, as it provided exemptions for processing \u201csolely\u201d for \u201cjournalistic purposes or the purpose of artistic or literary expression,\u201d if they were necessary from a free speech perspective. Article 85 of the GDPR omits the \u201csolely\u201d requirement and provides exemptions for the purpose of reconciling free speech with data protection. Article 85 refers to journalism, academia, art, and literature as examples of circumstances in which such exemptions would be necessary, resulting in a broader scope for exemption from GDPR rules \u201d.

disclosed 3.2 Official documents 3.3 Disclosed by the authority or body 3.4 The GDPR remains applicable 3.1 Personal data may be disclosed 3.2 Official documents 3.3 Disclosed by the authority or body 3.4 The GDPR remains applicable 4 Decisions 5 References Personal data in official documents held by a public authority or a public body or a private body for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest may be disclosed by the authority or body in accordance with Union or Member State law to which the public authority or body is subject in order to reconcile public access to official documents with the right to the protection of personal data pursuant to this Regulation. Transparency is essential to ensure the accountability of EU and national public institutions. Access to official documents is therefore recognised as a fundamental right under Article 42 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, as well as in the constitutions of many Member States. However, this right is not absolute. Under Article 86, it can be limited, inter alia , to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of other individuals, including the right to privacy and data protection of individuals whose personal data would be contained in such documents. Article 86 GDPR states that official documents \" may be disclosed \" for the sake of transparency even if the GDPR remains applicable, which is the case when those documents contain personal data. By doing so, Article 86 GDPR seems to indicate that EU data protection law should not systematically prevent their disclosure. The provision further points out that a potential conflict may arise between transparency and data protection, and stresses the need to reconcile those two conflicting rights, albeit without providing any indications as to how this should be accomplished. For example, it does not refer to the possibility of exempting controllers or processors from complying with certain obligations under the GDPR in order to facilitate access to documents as it happens, for example, in Article 85(1) GDPR , which notably assigns Member States the task of reconciling freedom of expression and information with data protection rules, and specifically lists which parts of the GDPR can be derogated from in that context in Article 85(2). By contrast, Article 86 GDPR does not provide any specific instructions on how to ensure compliance with the GDPR while ensuring sufficient transparency. This confusion is also reflected in the case law. In C-28/08 Bavarian Lager, the General Court held that transparency overrode data protection. However, on appeal, the CJEU ruled the other way and stated that the original decision to withhold the documents was correct. There is some suggestion that if the personal data is particularly sensitive, privacy should trump transparency. In C-439/19 B v Latvijas Republikas Saeima the CJEU held that \u2018in light [of] \u2026 the sensitivity of data relating to penalty points imposed for road traffic offences and of the seriousness of the interference with fundamental rights \u2026 which is caused by the disclosure of such data, it must be held that those rights prevail\u2019. [ 1 ] The interest of reconciling data protection and transparency is acknowledged, \u201c but the provision does not allow for exemptions and derogations from the rules contained in the GDPR nor does it set any further conditions \u201d. Thus, some argue, that \u201c[w] hen examining Article 86 GDPR one can wonder what normative value it actually has \u201d. [ 2 ] The term \u2018official documents\u2019 is not defined in the GDPR. Whichever interpretation the term is given will affect the scope of Article 86. Two possible interpretations include 1) documents generated by an authority in its official capacity and 2) all documents held by an authority. Recital 154 seems to lean towards the second as it states \u2018personal data in documents held by a public authority or a public body\u2019. A decision about its scope will have to be determined by member states or eventually the CJEU. Article 86 deals with disclosure by authorities and bodies covered by member state or union access laws. Since they are already covered by access regimes, a question arises as to why Article 86 as a provision exists. One idea is that it exists to prevent a situation where the GDPR is used by member states to create an obstacle against access laws. [ 3 ] The acknowledgement of a need for \u2018reconciliation\u2019 and acknowledgement of the importance of access to information in Article 86, supports this interpretation and makes room for pro-transparency arguments at a national level. [ 4 ] The task of balancing the right of access and right to privacy is left to each member state to decide in their national laws. This could result in fractured harmonisation as each member state has the competence to balance them differently. However, it can be concluded that the GDPR remains fully applicable in the context of the exercise of the right to access to official documents, with the need to respect, inter alia , the principle of lawful and fair processing ( Article 5 GDPR ) or the obligation to have a valid legal basis (Article 6 GDPR),[On this point, some authors have argued that \u201c the Union or Member State law referred to in Article 86 on which disclosure can be based is no different from a Union or Member State law referred to in Article 6 GDPR . Recital 154 also seems to go in this direction as it states that public access to official documents may be considered to be in \u201c the public interest \u201d. See, Kranenborg , in Kuner et al., The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Article 86 GDPR, p. 1217 (Oxford University Press 2020).] and with the possibility for DPAs to scrutinise such processing. This interpretation was also confirmed by Bavarian Lager , where the CJEU ruled that EU institutions have to apply EU data protection law in the context of access to official documents containing personal data. [ 5 ] In many Member States, the right of the public to transparency in the administration has often been conferred by provisions of national law requiring authorities to actively publish official documents, or to communicate a copy of them upon request. However, the GDPR remains applicable when those documents contain personal data, and the concerned authorities must therefore consider on which legal basis under Articles 6, 9 or 10 GDPR such processing of personal data may take place. . In fact, national DPA\u2019s (see UK, Germany, Estonia, Hungary etc.) are often tasked with balancing these two rights (such as freedom of information) and data privacy. [ 6 ] On the EU level, these enforcement powers are separated. The EU Ombudsman takes care of access while EDPS acts as an independent supervisor of privacy of the EU Institutions. Having said this, the two signed a Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation as early as 2006. [ 7 ] A fortiori , when the documents do not contain any sensitive personal data, such disclosures could be lawful on the basis of Article 6(1)(c) GDPR (i.e. processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject) or Article 6(1)(e) GDPR (i.e. processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller). When the disclosure of official documents is based on the necessity to comply with a legal obligation, the conditions laid down in the underlying national law must be fully considered, including any exceptions or potential grounds for refusal. Often, one of these conditions is the respect of the right of privacy and data protection of individuals, which would require the concerned authority to balance the interest of the requesting party to access the documents with the legitimate interest and right to privacy of the data subjects whose personal data appear in such documents. This analysis must be made on a case-by-case basis, in light of all the relevant circumstances, including the nature of the document, its value for the public, and the consequences of its disclosure. [ 8 ] For instance, the ECtHR in Magyar Helsinki Bizotts\u00e1g v. Hungary examined the refusal of the Hungarian authorities to provide an NGO with information relating to the names and work of ex officio defence counsel on the ground that such information constituted personal data. [ 9 ] The ECtHR considered this refusal contrary to the Convention, because (among others) the request for these names, \" although they constituted personal data, related predominantly to the conduct of professional activities in the context of public proceedings \", and that those activities \" cannot be considered to be a private matter \". A somewhat similar approach was adopted by the CJEU in a case where a Dutch journalist filed an access request concerning the functioning of an additional pension scheme for MEPs. The Parliament had first rejected the request in order to protect the privacy of parliamentarians. The CJEU, however, then annulled this decision because disclosure would not prejudice the legitimate interests of the MEPs. In particular, the CJEU held that \u201c in weighing up the interests engaged, the legitimate interests of the MEPs who are members of the additional pension scheme, which fall into the public sphere of those MEPs, must be subject to a lesser degree of protection than that which, following the logic of Regulation No 45/2001, would be enjoyed by the interests falling into their private sphere \u201d. [ 10 ] In conclusion, as Kranenborg correctly states, the case law of the ECtHR as well as the case law of the CJEU show that there are at least two criteria to assess whether disclosure of data is justified: \u201c the distinction between private and professional matters and the 'public nature' of the data \u201d.

States may further determine the specific conditions for the processing of a national identification number or any other identifier of general application. In that case the national identification number or any other identifier of general application shall be used only under appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject pursuant to this Regulation. National identification numbers (NIN) or identifiers of general application as understood in Article 87 GDPR are numbers used by public authorities for identifying a particular person, so that public services might be provided to that person while also respecting their right to privacy. [ 1 ] Member States have either adopted a system organised around a unique identifier, or around multiple identifiers for each citizen. Among the various identifiers of general application which may exist, one may for example refer to national registration numbers, national tax identifiers, ID or passport numbers, as well as social security numbers. NIN and other identifiers of general application provide many advantages. For example, they may facilitate the processing of personal data for the public administration. Although they are most commonly used by public actors, such as social security institutions or tax authorities, they can also in some instances be used by private actors, such as insurance companies, banks, or private employers, either to provide services or to prevent fraud (e.g. money laundering). The risks pertaining to the use of these identifiers can nevertheless be significant. If processed in an unsecured manner, they can notably lead to identity theft. [ 2 ] The complexity and sensitivity of the issue, which is linked to that of state sovereignty, has led the EU legislator not to fully harmonise these rules under the GDPR. Since there are no specific rules in this respect at the EU level, it is up to each Member State to determine the conditions under which these identifiers can be processed, beyond the general rules and principles set out in the GDPR. NIN or other identifiers of general application are not ipso facto characterised as a special category of data in the sense of Article 9 GDPR . However, each Member State has the possibility at the national level to characterise such identifiers as sensitive personal data, and to impose additional conditions on controllers or processors that process them. This was already the case under Article 8(7) of the DPD, the precursor of Article 87 GDPR. In many Member States, the processing of NIN and other identifiers of general application is therefore more strictly regulated, as well as usually limited to specific categories of actors for specific purposes. [ 3 ] Article 87 GDPR further provides that if a Member State decides to adopt specific measures regarding the processing of identifiers, it also has to implement appropriate safeguards to ensure the protection of the rights and freedoms of citizens. Article 87 GDPR nonetheless does not specify which additional safeguards should be implemented, once again leaving Member States with a broad margin of discretion in this respect. In line with this provision, Member States around the EU have adopted different approaches regarding the processing of NIN and other identifiers of general application. For instance, Belgium adopted a specific law in this respect decades ago, [ 4 ] and it has been amended and completed over time by several royal decrees. Similar laws have been adopted in Austria, Finland, France, the Netherlands, or Portugal (to name a few). Such provisions establish which actors can process national registration numbers, as well as the conditions for such processing to take place. \u2191 van Eecke, Simkus , in Kuner et al., The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Article 87 GDPR, p. 1226 (Oxford University Press 2020). \u2191 EU Commission, Survey on Scams and Fraud Experienced by Consumers, January 2020 (available here ). \u2191 Van Eecke and Simkus , in Kuner et al., The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Article 87 GDPR, p. 1225 (Oxford University Press 2020). \u2191 Loi du 8 aout 1983 organisant un registre national des personnes physiques",

Notification to the Commission 4 Decisions 5 References 1.   Member States may, by law or by collective agreements, provide for more specific rules to ensure the protection of the rights and freedoms in respect of the processing of employees' personal data in the employment context, in particular for the purposes of the recruitment, the performance of the contract of employment, including discharge of obligations laid down by law or by collective agreements, management, planning and organisation of work, equality and diversity in the workplace, health and safety at work, protection of employer's or customer's property and for the purposes of the exercise and enjoyment, on an individual or collective basis, of rights and benefits related to employment, and for the purpose of the termination of the employment relationship. 2.   Those rules shall include suitable and specific measures to safeguard the data subject's human dignity, legitimate interests and fundamental rights, with particular regard to the transparency of processing, the transfer of personal data within a group of undertakings, or a group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity and monitoring systems at the work place. 3.   Each Member State shall notify to the Commission those provisions of its law which it adopts pursuant to paragraph 1, by 25 May 2018 and, without delay, any subsequent amendment affecting them. Article 88 GDPR allows Member States to further regulate the processing of personal data in the context of an employment relationship. The provision gives Member States the chance to regulate this specific area further without the member states being obliged to do so. If a Member state chooses to use this opening clause it has to consider the specific requirements set by Article 88(2) GDPR for such national data protection rules. This means that - given the wide disparities between Member States\u2019 labour laws - the GDPR prescribes only a minimum harmonisation in the context of employment and the level of data protection can be further  increased by each Member State. [ 1 ] It should be noted that any processing activity governed by a specific rule under Article 88 GDPR is also subject to the requirements of other provisions of the GDPR (e.g. Article 5 , 6 and 9 GDPR). [ 2 ] Article 88(1) GDPR acts as an opening clause, permitting Member States to provide further rules for the protection of personal data in the context of employment, while Article 88(2) GDPR sets conditions to the use of the opening clause, establishing a minimum threshold from which Member States cannot derogate from. In other words, if a Member State chooses to use the opening clause under Article 88(1) GDPR, any rules introduced must meet the criteria imposed by Article 88(2) GDPR. Lastly, Article 88(3) GDPR imposes an obligation on Member States to notify the Commission of any laws which it adopts pursuant to Article 88(1) GDPR. The first paragraph of Article 88 GDPR provides that Member States may, by law or by collective agreements, provide for more specific rules regulating the processing of employees\u2019 personal data in the employment context. In doing so, Article 88(1) GDPR provides an opening clause, widening the capacity for Member States to regulate the protection of personal data in the employment context. It further specifies the two regulatory instruments through which Member States may rely on in the adoption of rules under Article 88(1) GDPR, the first of which is national law , and the second is collective agreement. The GDPR is a regulation and thus has direct effect. [ 3 ] Therefore, notwithstanding a data subject\u2019s employment status or of any measures adopted under domestic law, they enjoy all the rights and protections afforded by the GDPR regardless of whether their Member State adopts legislation under Article 88(1) GDPR. Rather, the purpose of Article 88 GDPR is to permit Member States to further regulate on data processing in the employment context in a manner that \u2018 would best suit the needs of their own particular legal system, while at the same time keeping in line with the rules set by the GDPR.\u2019 [ 4 ] Therefore, Article 88 GDPR acts as a \u2018 reinforcement \u2019 clause, as Member States are free to adopt more protective rules or maintain the minimum standards required by the GDPR. [ 5 ] \"Article 88(1) and (2) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, even where Member States rely on that article in order to introduce, into their respective national legal systems, \u2018more specific rules\u2019, by law or by collective agreements, the requirements arising from the other provisions that are specifically referred to in the present question, namely Article 5, Article 6(1) and Article 9(1) and (2) of that regulation, must also be satisfied. That applies, in particular, to compliance with the criterion of the necessity of processing laid down in those provisions\" CJEU_-_C-65/23_-_MK_v_K_GmbH , margin number 43. The existence of for this opening clause can be explained by the specific features of such processing, namely, the existence of a relationship of subordination between employees and their employer. [ 6 ] Article 88(1) GDPR\u2019s use of the discretionary verb \u2018 may \u2019 establishes that Member States are not obliged to further regulate the protection of employees' personal data in the employment context. The Article simply grants Member States regulatory leeway, which they can, but do not have to use. [ 7 ] Article 88(1) GDPR, provides a non-exhaustive list of matters which Member States may decide to provide more specific rules for. This list includes processing of individuals\u2019 personal data for the purposes of recruitment, performance of employment contracts, management, planning and organisation of work, equality and diversity in the workplace, health and safety at work, protection of employer's or customer's property and for the purposes of the exercise and enjoyment of social benefits in the course of employment or after the termination of the employment relationship. Essentially, this list is suggestive and if Member States choose to further regulate the matter, they are not bound to the content outlined in Article 88(1) GDPR. Article 88(1) GDPR provides that Member States may establish more specific rules for the protection of employees\u2019 personal data by law. The concept of \u2018law\u2019 encompasses all legal norms enacted by a Member State, including statutory instruments and legal provisions that rank below secondary legislation. [ 8 ] The second means through which Member States may establish more specific rules for the protection of employees\u2019 personal data is by collective agreement. [ 9 ] The GDPR does not define these terms. Consequently, the meaning of collective agreement is to be interpreted autonomously from Union law, and not from Member States\u2019 definition in national legislation. [ 10 ] Union law does not have a single definition of collective agreement. Nonetheless, on a basic level, collective agreements can be defined as \u2018 agreements concluded between single employers or their organisations, on the one hand, and organisations of workers such as trade unions, on the other. These agreements establish the content of individual contracts of employment and regulate relationships between the parties .\u2019 [ 11 ] According to Recital 155 the term collective agreements include works agreements. [ 12 ] Member States\u2019 labour laws determine whether and on what level collective agreements on this matter may be concluded. [ 13 ] It should be noted that a collective agreement itself - just as a regulation by national law -  can only be a legal basis for a processing activity if it gives rise to a legal obligation within the meaning of Article 6(1)(c) GDPR . [ 14 ] For example, non-binding collective agreements (such as those under English law) that do not give rise to a legal obligation, cannot be invoked as a legal basis by an employer. [ 15 ] While Member States are afforded discretion of whether to provide for more specific rules in the context of employment, when they choose to do so, these rules are subject to certain requirements. Article 88(1) GDPR acts as an opening clause, creating space for Member States to further regulate the relationship between the GDPR and domestic labour laws. [ 16 ] However, Article 88(2) GDPR determines the scope of that regulatory freedom and establishes conditions to its use. There is a significant overlap between the first and second paragraphs of Article 88 GDPR, therefore neither provision can be interpreted without reference to the other. The opening clause should be read as containing two different functions, a permissive function (Article 88(1) GDPR) and a conditional function (Article 88(2) GDPR). [ 17 ] While Article 88(2) GDPR establishes specific requirements for the utilisation of the opening clause, Article 88(1) GDPR establishes two objectives pursued by the opening clause. It provides that (i) rules must be more specific, and (ii) they must pursue the aim of ensuring the protection of the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Consequently, any interpretation of Article 88(2) GDPR must take into account these objectives. [ 18 ] The first objective pursued by the opening clause under Article 88(1) GDPR, is to allow Member States to regulate for \u2018 more specific \u2019 rules. Generally, this objective seeks to ensure that any rules introduced by Member States have a normative content related to data protection in the employment context, but are distinct from the general rules laid down by the GDPR. Therefore, any regulatory activity by a Member State under Article 88 GDPR should address the specialities of processing activities in the  employment context, e.g. the relationship of authority between an employee and its employer. [ 19 ] For example: Italy has introduced Law 104/2022 (Decreto Transperanza), [ 20 ] which imposes more obligations upon employers than those under the GDPR. For instance, Article 4 of Law 104/2022 obliges employers to undertake a data protection impact assessment where employees are subject to automated decision-making, surveillance and monitoring activities. More targeted rules are necessary in the employment context, because data processed in the course of an employment relationship gives rise to power dynamics that are more unbalanced than in the traditional controller\u2013data subject relationship. [ 21 ] This disparity arises because the employment relationship is characterised by the subordination of the employee to the employer. The objective of Article 88(1) GDPR of permitting Member States to introduce more specific rules must be read in line with Article 88(2) GDPR, which imposes conditions to the utilisation of Article 88(1) GDPR. Therefore, for a comprehensive interpretation of the term \u2018 more specific\u2019 , please also refer to the section on Article 88(2) GDPR below. Article 88(1) GDPR establishes that Member States may introduce more specific rules \u2018 to ensure the protection of the rights and freedoms in respect of the processing of employees\u2019 personal data in the employment context \u2019. The use of the word \u2018 to\u2019 requires that any norms introduced by Member States must pursue the aim of protecting the rights and freedoms of data subjects in the employment context. Article 88(2) GDPR further clarifies that those norms \u2018 shall include suitable and specific measures to safeguard the data subject\u2019s human dignity, legitimate interests and fundamental rights\u2019 . Therefore, when Article 88(2) GDPR is read in conjunction with the objectives laid down in Article 88(1) GDPR, it is evident that the aim of ensuring the protection of the rights and freedoms referred to under Article 88(1) GDPR must be done with a view specifically to safeguarding the data subject\u2019s human dignity, legitimate interests and fundamental rights. \"[T]he rules adopted by a Member State on the basis of Article 88 must have the objective of protecting the rights and freedoms of employees with respect to the processing of their personal data.\" CJEU - C-65/23 - MK v K GmbH , margin number 41. Article 88\u2019s scope of application is determined by the meaning of 'employee' in this context, as the wording of the provision clearly establishes that Member States may provide for more specific rules \u2018 in respect of the processing of employees\u2019 personal data in the employment context \u2019. Nonetheless, the terms \u2018 employment \u2019 or \u2018 employee \u2019 are not defined in the GDPR. As a result, the term \u2018 employee \u2019 should adopt an autonomous interpretation in accordance with principles of Union law and should not be defined from Member States\u2019 national law. [ 22 ] Reference can be made to CJEU case law recognising the essential feature of an employment relationship in the fact that \"for a certain period of time a person performs services for and under the direction of another person in return for which he or she receives remuneration\". [ 23 ] Consequently, the scope of Article 88 GDPR is relatively broad, and only appears to exclude self-employed workers. Employment relationships in the public sector are covered by Article 88 GDPR. [ 24 ] CJEU case law has followed this broad reading: In Hauptpersonalrat der Lehrerinnen und Lehrer , the Court acknowledged that as the GDPR does not define the terms \u2018 employees \u2019 and \u2018 employment \u2019, and does not delegate their interpretation to the law of Member States, the meaning and scope of both terms must take on an autonomous and uniform interpretation throughout the Union. [ 25 ] \"The term \u2018employee\u2019 in its usual meaning refers to a person who performs his or her work in the context of a relationship of subordination with his or her employer and therefore under the latter\u2019s control [...] Likewise, the essential feature of an \u2018employment relationship\u2019 is that for a certain period of time a person performs services for and under the direction of another person in return for which he or she receives remuneration [...]\" CJEU - C-34/21 - Hauptpersonalrat der Lehrerinnen und Lehrer , margin number 42 et seq. The second paragraph of Article 88 GDPR provides conditionals for any national specific measure regulating the protection of data in the employment context. The provision places substantive limits on Member States\u2019 regulatory powers by establishing material requirements that any national rules must follow if they are to be compatible with Article 88 GDPR. [ 26 ] These requirements provide that national rules must include \u2018 suitable and specific \u2019 measures in order to safeguard data subject\u2019s: human dignity , legitimate interests and fundamental rights . Particular, this regards: the transparency of processing , the transfer of personal data within a group of undertakings, or a group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity and monitoring systems at the workplace . Therefore, Article 88(2) GDPR sets out conditions that any rule adopted on the basis of the opening clause in Article 88(1) GDPR must meet and thus circumscribes the discretion of any Member State adopting any data protection regulation in the employment context. [ 27 ] Therefore, Article 88(2) GDPR sets out conditions that any rule adopted on the basis of the opening clause in Article 88(1) GDPR must meet and thus circumscribes the discretion of any Member State adopting any data protection regulation in the employment context. [ 27 ] \"[T]hose rules cannot be limited to reiterating the provisions of that regulation and must seek to protect employees\u2019 rights and freedoms in respect of the processing of their personal data in the employment context and include suitable and specific measures to protect the data subjects\u2019 human dignity, legitimate interests and fundamental rights.\" CJEU - C-34/21 - Hauptpersonalrat der Lehrerinnen und Lehrer , margin number 65. In essence, these requirements mean that for Article 88(2) GDPR, any rules introduced by Member States under Article 88(1) GDPR must contextually relate to data protection in the employment context, but must be more specific than the general rules laid down by the GDPR. Also, any national provision (a 'more specific rule') must seek to protect employees\u2019 rights and freedoms in respect of the processing of their personal data in the employment context and include suitable and specific measures to protect the data subjects\u2019 human dignity, legitimate interests and fundamental rights. Particular regarding the transparency of processing, the transfer of personal data within a group of undertakings, or a group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, and monitoring systems at the work place. [ 28 ] It should be noted that - in addition to the requirement stipulated in Article 88(2) GDPR - also other provisions of the GDPR (e.g. Article 5 , 6(1) , 9(1) GDPR) must also be satisfied. [ 29 ] According to Article 88(3) GDPR, Member States must notify the Commission about any laws they adopt pursuant to this Article. For an overview of the current national implementation laws see the list provided by the European Commission. [ 30 ] According to the provision's wording, this requirement applies only to national laws and not to collective agreements. [ 31 ] \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 88 GDPR \u2191 During the GDPR\u2019s Trilogue proceedings, European legislators were unable to reach a consensus on standards for the protection of employee personal data. As a result, Article 88 GDPR is a \u2018compromise regulation\u2019, which leaves any further regulation to the discretion of Member States.

Processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, shall be subject to appropriate safeguards, in accordance with this Regulation, for the rights and freedoms of the data subject. Those safeguards shall ensure that technical and organisational measures are in place in particular in order to ensure respect for the principle of data minimisation. Those measures may include pseudonymisation provided that those purposes can be fulfilled in that manner. Where those purposes can be fulfilled by further processing which does not permit or no longer permits the identification of data subjects, those purposes shall be fulfilled in that manner. 2.   Where personal data are processed for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, Union or Member State law may provide for derogations from the rights referred to in Articles 15, 16, 18 and 21 subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article in so far as such rights are likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the specific purposes, and such derogations are necessary for the fulfilment of those purposes. 3.   Where personal data are processed for archiving purposes in the public interest, Union or Member State law may provide for derogations from the rights referred to in Articles 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 and 21 subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article in so far as such rights are likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the specific purposes, and such derogations are necessary for the fulfilment of those purposes. 4.   Where processing referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 serves at the same time another purpose, the derogations shall apply only to processing for the purposes referred to in those paragraphs. Article 89 GDPR regulates the processing of personal data for four distinct purposes: (i) archiving in the public interest, (ii) scientific research, (iii) historical research and (iv) statistical purposes. In many instances, collecting large quantities of personal data is a key component, if not a prerequisite, for achieving such purposes. For example, clinical trials or political polls are both based on the large-scale collection and analysis of sensitive personal data. Because of the broad scope of such processing operations, as well as the risks they entail, the EU legislator has introduced specific safeguards in Article 89(1) GDPR to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects. At the same time, overburdening controllers with legal obligations may ultimately impede research, or even defeat the very purpose of the processing. This, in turn, may become detrimental for society, as many societal advances are based on archiving systems, scientific and historical research, or statistical studies. Hence, Article 89(2) and (3) GDPR also allow for specific derogation to the GDPR for these purposes, as further detailed below. Article 89(1) GDPR provides that when processing operations take place for (i) archiving in the public interest, (ii) scientific or historical research or (iii) statistical purposes, appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject must be implemented. After defining each of these purposes, the safeguards that controllers must be in place will be discussed. According to Recital 158 GDPR, processing for archiving purposes in the public interest can be defined as any operation \u201c to acquire, preserve, appraise, arrange, describe, communicate, promote, disseminate and provide access to records of enduring value for general public interest \u201d. This means that personal or family archives, or company records will generally not be covered by Article 89 GDPR, unless they also fulfil the criteria of being kept in the \u201c public interest \u201d. [ 1 ] Recital 159 GDPR states that \u201c the processing of personal data for scientific research purposes should be interpreted in a broad manner including for example technological development and demonstration, fundamental research, applied research and privately funded research \u201d. Recital 157 GDPR makes it clear that scientific research also includes processing generating \u201c new knowledge of great value with regard to widespread medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and depression . [\u2026] Within social science, research on the basis of registries enables researchers to obtain essential knowledge about the long-term correlation of a number of social conditions such as unemployment and education with other life conditions \u201d. The GDPR as a whole, and Article 89 GDPR in particular, do not distinguish between scientific research pursuing public interests and that pursuing private or purely commercial ones. It follows that, if the applicable requirements are met, \" purely private or commercial interests can be pursued through the processing of personal data for scientific research purposes \u201d. [ 2 ] Clinical trials conducted by pharmaceutical companies, for example, would therefore fall within the scope of Article 89 GDPR. Similarly, scientific research conducted by a university or a public institution would also fall within the scope of Article 89 GDPR. Under Recital 160 \u201c[w] here personal data are processed for historical research purposes, this Regulation should also apply to that processing. This should also include historical research and research for genealogical purposes, bearing in mind that this Regulation should not apply to deceased persons \u201d. In ruling out data relating to deceased persons, this Recital confirms Recital 27 GDPR, according to which the GDPR \u201c does not apply to the personal data of deceased persons \u201d. However, it should be noted that genealogy research may relate to living relatives as well, in which case the GDPR would still apply to protect the rights and freedoms of those individuals. [ 3 ] According to Recital 162 GDPR, \u201c statistical purposes \u201d include \u201c any operation of collection and the processing of personal data necessary for statistical surveys or for the production of statistical results \u201d. Recital 162 GDPR specifies that \u201c the result of processing for statistical purposes is not personal data, but aggregate data\", and that \"this result or the personal data are not used in support of measures or decisions regarding any particular natural person \u201d. This sentence seems to suggest that aggregated data are never, by definition, personal data, with the concomitant non-application of the GDPR. From a logical point of view, this conclusion seems to be correct. However, the main assumption must be true: in particular, that aggregated data are actually anonymous and therefore not referable to any data subject. In practice however, given the high threshold required by the WP29 to achieve true anonymisation, it seems rather unlikely that all aggregated data would systematically fall outside of the scope of the GDPR. [ 4 ] The risk of re-identification is indeed inherent to the processing of large amounts of data. [ 5 ] For these reasons, scholars have convincingly argued that \u201c a better reading of recital 162 is that it is only intended to make clear that data processed for statistical purposes remain personal data (subject to the GDPR) until they are anonymised through aggregation (i.e. until the 'result' of the statistical processing operation is achieved) \u201d. [ 6 ] According to Article 89(1) GDPR, controllers and processors must implement appropriate safeguards to protect the rights and freedom of data subjects whose personal data are collected and further processed for the aforementioned purposes. More specifically, technical and organisational measures must be implemented to ensure, in particular, respect for the principle of data minimisation, as set in Article 5(1)(c) GDPR . This means that the collection of personal data should from the outset be limited to what is appropriate, relevant and necessary for the purpose pursued. The far-reaching derogations granted under Article 89(2) and (3) GDPR can only be justified under this strictly applicable premise. [ 7 ] Among the organisational and technical measures that controllers or processors should put in place, Article 89(1) GDPR specifically mentions pseudonymisation and anonymisation. [ 8 ] This list is of course non-exhaustive, and there may well be other suitable measures that adequately reduce the risks associated with the processing of personal data in those areas. [ 9 ] Under Article 4(5) GDPR, pseudonymisation means the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately. Pseudonymised data are thus personal data, since the individuals to whom they relate remain identifiable (Recital 26 GDPR). Through pseudonymisation, controllers are therefore not exempted from complying with the GDPR, but are simply reducing the overall risks linked to the processing of personal data. According to Recital 26 GDPR, anonymisation is the process of rendering personal data anonymous, in the sense that the data subject is no longer identified or identifiable. The anonymisation process must be robust enough to prevent any risk of reidentification. Hence, the technical requirements of anonymisation may vary from one case to another depending on the data available, and may become increasingly difficult to achieve as re-identification techniques evolve in parallel. [ 10 ] While Article 89(1) GDPR states that pseudonymisation \" may \" be used as a technical measure, anonymisation becomes mandatory when it does not prevent or defeat the purpose of the processing. For example, if a public authority orders a statistical survey on water consumption to improve water management in a specific city, the study should be based on anonymised data if identifying the respondents is not necessary to reach valid findings. By contrast, conducting a clinical trial may require the collection and monitoring of personal data of identified patients. In that case, anonymisation would therefore neither be possible, nor required under Article 89(1) GDPR. All in all, it can be concluded that anonymisation only becomes a mandatory technical measure if the research purpose allows for it. [ 11 ] As previously said, anonymisation and pseudonymisation are only two examples of technical measures that can be put in place by the controllers or processors when conducting research for scientific, historical or statistical purpose. Other measures and safeguards should also be considered. At the national level, Member States have sometimes established more specific obligations in that respect. In Luxembourg, for example, Article 65 of the Act of 1st October 2018 on the processing of personal data specifically requires controllers to put in place twelve organisational or technical measures, including anonymisation and pseudonymisation, when processing personal data for scientific or historical research, archiving purposes or statistical purposes. Among the other measures listed in that article, one may for example find the appointment of a Data Protection Officer (DPO) to supervise the processing of the personal data, the obligation to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), the encryption of the personal data with state-of-the-art key management, restrictions on data access within the organisation of the controller, or raising the awareness of the staff with respect to professional secrecy and personal data protection. The same article further specifies that the controller must document and justify for each project the exclusion, where applicable, of one or more of the measures listed in that article. Other Member States have adopted similar provisions. Thus, besides the minimum requirements set in Article 89(1) GDPR, controllers involved in the processing of personal data for scientific or historical research, archiving purposes or statistical purposes should also pay due attention to possible additional requirements under national legislation. Under Article 89(2) GDPR, where personal data are processed for statistical purposes, Union or Member State law may provide for derogations from the rights referred to in Articles 15 (right of access by the data subject), 16 (right to rectification), 18 (right to restriction of processing) and 21 GDPR (right to object). Such derogations nonetheless remain subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in Article 89(1) GDPR. Furthermore, two other requirements have to be simultaneously met in order for these derogations to apply: first, the exercise of the data subjects\u2019 rights would render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the specific purposes; second, such derogations must be necessary for the fulfilment of those purposes. It therefore follows that derogations only apply when strictly necessary for achieving the purpose of the processing. Under Article 89(3) GDPR, where personal data are processed for archiving purposes in the public interest, Union or Member State law may provide for derogations from the rights referred to in Articles 15 (right of access by the data subject), 16 (right to rectification), 18 (right to restriction of processing), 19 (notification obligation regarding rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing), 20 (right to data portability) and 21 (right to object) GDPR. The same conditions as provided under Article 89(2) GDPR also applies to these derogations. In other words, these derogations are only allowed when necessary for achieving the archiving purpose at stake, and when the exercise of the data subject's rights would render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of that purpose. Article 89(4) GDPR makes it clear that the derogations to the GDPR are only available for processing specified in Article 89 GDPR, and not for any other purposes that may be pursued at the same time on the same dataset. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 89 GDPR \u2191 See, Wiese Svanberg, in Kuner et al., The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Article 89 GDPR, p. 1242 and ss. (Oxford University Press 2020) who also points out that the requirement that archiving \" must take place 'in the public interest' should be regarded as satisfied as long as any individual archiving activity is set out-even broadly in Member State law. Thus, the GDPR does not limit the extent to which Member States can delimit what materials are of sufficient historical interest to warrant subjecting them to archiving rules \u201d. \u2191 See, Wiese Svanberg, in Kuner et al., The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Article 89 GDPR, p. 1242 and ss. (Oxford University Press 2020) who also specifies that any other relevant legislation (such as legislation on clinical trials in the case of medical or scientific research) may also apply. \u2191 Eichler , in BeckOK DatenschutzR, Article 89 GDPR, margin number 6a (C.H.

See also Recital 156 which states that \u201c The further processing of personal data for archiving purposes [\u2026] is to be carried out when the controller has assessed the feasibility to fulfil those purposes by processing data which do not permit or no longer permit the identification of data subjects, provided that appropriate safeguards exist \u201d.",

3.3 (3) National contract law 4 Decisions 5 References 1.   Where point (a) of Article 6(1) applies, in relation to the offer of information society services directly to a child, the processing of the personal data of a child shall be lawful where the child is at least 16 years old. Where the child is below the age of 16 years, such processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child. Member States may provide by law for a lower age for those purposes provided that such lower age is not below 13 years. 2.   The controller shall make reasonable efforts to verify in such cases that consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child, taking into consideration available technology. 3.   Paragraph 1 shall not affect the general contract law of Member States such as the rules on the validity, formation or effect of a contract in relation to a child. According to Recital 38, children benefit from specific protections by reason of their reduced understanding of the risks, consequences and rights related to the processing of personal data. This is particularly the case when children\u2019s data are used for marketing and profiling activities as well as when a service involving the collection and use of such data is offered directly to children. As such, Article 8 GDPR stipulates additional requirements for consent by children. Article 8 GDPR applies only if the processing of data (i) relies on consent as a legal basis and (ii) if the internet society service is being offered \"directly\" to a child. Under the GDPR, the default age at which a child can express their consent is 16. In principle, age verification should not lead to excessive data processing. In other words, it may be appropriate to simply require a new subscriber to disclose their year of birth or to fill out a form stating that they are (not) a minor in some low-risk situations. However, if processing involves higher risks or if doubts arise concerning the truthfulness of the user's statement, the controller should review their age verification mechanisms and consider introducing alternative checks. [ 1 ] The 16-year age limit is not absolute. Under Article 8(1) GDPR, Member States can adjust this age requirement to anywhere between 13 and 16 years. Thus, controllers must identify the legal age of consent in the jurisdictions that they operate in by taking into account its target demographic. In particular, it should be noted that \" a controller providing a cross-border service cannot always rely on complying with only the law of the Member State in which it has its main establishment but may need to comply with the respective national laws of each Member State in which it offers the information society service(s). \" [ 2 ] According to Article 4(25) GDPR , which in turn refers to Article 1(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/1535, an \"information society service\" (ISS) is any service normally provided for remuneration, at a distance, by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of services. For the purposes of this definition: (i) \u2018at a distance\u2019 means that the service is provided without the parties being physically present; (ii) \u2018by electronic means\u2019 means that the service is both sent and received at its destination through electronic equipment which processes and stores data, as well as entirely transmitted, conveyed and received by wire, by radio, by optical means or by other electromagnetic means; (iii) \u2018at the individual request of a recipient of services\u2019 means that the service is provided through the transmission of data on individual request. It follows that, if a service does not meet the aforementioned requirements, Article 8 GDPR (and its safeguards) will not apply. Take services which are not offered \"at a distance\" (for example, electronic games in an arcade room), or are not provided \"electronically\" (medical advice by telephone), or concern the exchange of goods and not services (the purchase and sale of mobile phones via corresponding digital sales platforms). [ 3 ] Further, in accordance with the accountability principle, the EDPB has stressed that it is up to the controller to determine what measures are appropriate in a specific case. As a general rule, controllers should avoid verification solutions which themselves involve the excessive collection of personal data. The use of the wording \u2018offered directly to a child\u2019 shows that only some ISSs fall within the scope of Article 8 GDPR. In other words, if an information society service provider makes it clear to potential users that \" it is only offering its service to persons aged 18 or over, and this is not undermined by other evidence (such as the content of the site or marketing plans) then the service will not be considered to be \u2018offered directly to a child\u2019 and Article 8 will not apply \". [ 4 ] Where the child is below the age of 16 years (or the lower age set forth by national law), such processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that consent is given by their legal guardian. Article 8(2) GDPR requires the controller to take \"reasonable efforts\" to verify that the child was authorised by a guardian to use the information society service. According to the EDPB, what is reasonable once again depends upon \" the risks inherent in the processing as well as the available technology. In low-risk cases, verification of parental responsibility via email may be sufficient. Conversely, in high-risk cases, it may be appropriate to ask for more proof, so that the controller is able to verify and retain the information pursuant to Article 7(1) GDPR \". [ 5 ] In practice, this can be done in different ways. For example, the EDPB has suggested that a parent or guardian could be asked to make a payment of \u20ac0,01 to the controller via a bank transaction, and include a brief confirmation in the description line of the transaction that the bank account holder is the user\u2019s legal guardian. Another option could be the use of trusted third party verification services. [ 6 ] Article 8(3) GDPR makes it clear that Article 8(1) GDPR only refers to consent, not to the object of the legal transaction between the data subject and the controller, typically the contract. This means that consent can be given without the legal transaction taking place and that the legal transaction can be effective even if the consent is not. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 8 GDPR \u2191 EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 05/2020 on consent under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 4 May 2020 (Version 1.1), p. 28 (available here ). \u2191 EDPB, \u2018Guidelines 05/2020 on consent under Regulation 2016/679\u2019, 4 May 2020 (Version 1.1), p. 27 (available here ). \u2191 K\u00fchling, Buchner , in K\u00fchling, Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 8 GDPR, margin number 13 (C.H.

Member States may adopt specific rules to set out the powers of the supervisory authorities laid down in points (e) and (f) of Article 58(1) in relation to controllers or processors that are subject, under Union or Member State law or rules established by national competent bodies, to an obligation of professional secrecy or other equivalent obligations of secrecy where this is necessary and proportionate to reconcile the right of the protection of personal data with the obligation of secrecy. Those rules shall apply only with regard to personal data which the controller or processor has received as a result of or has obtained in an activity covered by that obligation of secrecy. 2.   Each Member State shall notify to the Commission the rules adopted pursuant to paragraph 1, by 25 May 2018 and, without delay, any subsequent amendment affecting them. While privacy and data protection are closely related to the right to informational self-determination, i.e. the right for an individual to exercise control over the flow of information concerning them, professional secrecy is a concept that protects the community's interest in being able to trust and rely professionals in whom secrets are confided in the performance of their duties. Professional secrecy as a moral principle or rule can already be traced back to the Hippocratic Oath, which was drafted circa AD 275. According to this oath, physicians must refrain from divulging information on their patients and should consider such information as \" holy secrets \". [ 1 ] Today, professional secrecy is still considered as an essential part of the organisation of modern life, as it guarantees the confidentiality of the communications between a person and a professional to whom sensitive information are being disclosed, such as a doctor, a lawyer or an accountant. [ 2 ] Because information subject to professional secrecy may contain personal data, the GDPR could also apply to it. This means, inter alia , that DPAs could request from a professional to disclose confidential information in the course of an investigation, in accordance with Article 58(1) GDPR . Article 90 GDPR was drafted with a view to regulate potential conflicts between the application of the GDPR on the one hand, and obligations of professional secrecy on the other. More specifically, this provision mandates Member States with the task of regulating certain DPAs investigative powers when exercised against a controller or processor bound by professional secrecy. Under Article 90 \u201c Member States may adopt specific rules to set out the powers of the supervisory authorities laid down in points (e) and (f) of Article 58(1) in relation to controllers or processors that are subject [\u2026] to an obligation of professional secrecy or other equivalent obligation \u201d. National regulation may only cover situations in which the controller or processor is subject to professional secrecy or an equivalent obligation of confidentiality under Union Law or the Member State Law, or under an obligation issued by the competent national authorities. Examples of such professional secrecy obligations are not mentioned in the GDPR. However, they presumably include the profession of attorney, doctor, notary, tax advisor and auditor. As such, professional secrecy obligations must not have been recognised by law to fall within the scope of Article 90 GDPR; the national specifications can also relate to confidentiality obligations which have been issued by \u201c national bodies \u201d. [ 3 ] Typical examples of such national bodies include public institutions controlling the financial sector, bar associations or medical orders. In line with Article 90 GDPR, such national bodies may also adopt rules on professional secrecy which are binding on their members and may limit the investigative powers of DPAs. [ 4 ] Article 90(1) GDPR provides that when a controller or a processor is subject to professional secrecy, Member States may adopt national measures limiting specific investigative powers of the competent DPA. [ 5 ] The powers in question are provided for in Article 58(e) and (f) GDPR, under which the DPA can \u201c obtain, from the controller and the processor, access to all personal data and to all information necessary for the performance of its tasks \u201d as well as \u201c access to any premises of the controller and the processor, including to any data processing equipment and means, in accordance with Union or Member State procedural law \u201d. [ 6 ] It seems clear that the two powers in question can create conflicts where the controller is subject to a professional or other secrecy obligation. In such circumstances, the EU legislator allows Member States to introduce specific rules for the exercise of the investigative powers. For example, an attorney could resist the handing over of information subject to professional secrecy upon request of a DPA, if national law allows for such a derogation. The only condition is that the national measures adopted by the Member State are both \u201c necessary and proportionate to reconcile the right of the protection of personal data with the obligation of secrecy \u201d. In the absence of precise indications in the text of the law, European case-law on necessity and proportionality may provide guidance on how to balance these conflicting interests. [ 7 ] Under Article 90(2) GDPR, each Member State has the obligation to notify to the Commission the rules adopted pursuant to paragraph 1, by the 25 th May 2018 and, without delay, any subsequent amendment affecting them. Such notifications were made by most Member States and are accessible on the website of the Commission.

4 Decisions 5 References 1.   Where in a Member State, churches and religious associations or communities apply, at the time of entry into force of this Regulation, comprehensive rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to processing, such rules may continue to apply, provided that they are brought into line with this Regulation. 2.   Churches and religious associations which apply comprehensive rules in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article shall be subject to the supervision of an independent supervisory authority, which may be specific, provided that it fulfils the conditions laid down in Chapter VI of this Regulation. Religious organisations usually process large quantities of personal data relating to their members, for example religious or philosophical beliefs, which are considered \u00a0special categories of personal data pursuant to Article 9 GDPR . As a consequence, ensuring that they comply with data protection law is essential to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects who are (or were) members of such organisations. For historical reasons, however, specific religious organisations may benefit from a particular status in some Member States, which allows them to apply and adopt their own set of binding rules, distinct from national law. For example, as far as the Roman Catholic Church is concerned, some Member States allow for canon law to apply instead of national law for matters falling within the competences of the church. Article 91 GDPR takes this reality into account by allowing, under certain circumstances, churches and religious associations or communities to be subject to their own set of data protection rules, distinct from the GDPR. This derogation is however subject to stringent conditions, as further detailed below. By implication, churches and religious associations or communities that do not meet these conditions remain bound by the GDPR in its entirety. [ 1 ] For the derogation of Article 91 GDPR to become relevant, the following conditions must be fulfilled: (i) first, the controller or processor must qualify as a church, a religious association or a religious community\u00a0; (ii) second, the controller must have adopted and applied, before the entry into force of the GDPR, its own set of data protection rules; and (iii) third, this set of data protection rules must be comprehensive enough and in line with the GDPR (or must otherwise be brought in line with the GDPR). The controller must fall within a specific category of actors, namely \u201c churches and religious associations or communities \u201d. The GDPR does not define these concepts. However, the EU legislator seems to have embraced a broad definition of the notion of religion in general. For instance, under Article 10(1)(b) of Directive 2011/95/EU, \u201c [t]he concept of religion shall in particular include the holding of theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, the participation in, or abstention from, formal worship in private or in public, either alone or in community with others, other religious acts or expressions of view, or forms of personal or communal conduct based on or mandated by any religious belief and as a consequence of religious organisation \u201d. [ 2 ] Based on these specifications, typical examples of religious organisations may include the Roman Catholic Church, and all the catholic associations or communities that belong to it (parishes, monasteries, convents, etc.), the Federation of Islamic Organisations in Europe and all the organisations that operate under it (from national associations to local mosques), or the European Jewish Congress and the different communities it brings together (including national coordinating committees and local Jewish communities). Based on the EU legislator\u2019s broad definition of religion, the notion of religious associations could further include smaller religious, philosophical or non-confessional organisations. [ 3 ] In the Jehovan todistajat case for example, the CJEU seems to have recognized the Jehovah's Witnesses community as a religious association. In theory, the same considerations could also apply to other minority religious or philosophical groups, such as the Freemasons, the Church of Scientology or Buddhist communities. [ 4 ] The second condition for the derogation prescribed in Article 91 GDPR to apply is that the religious organisations must have already adopted and applied their own set of data protection rules prior to the entry into force of the GDPR (i.e. prior to 25 May 2016). In practice, this presupposes that the religious organisations (i) must have been allowed to adopt such rules in the first place under national law (cf. special regime); and (ii) must have made use of that possibility before 25 May 2016. Although the logic behind this second condition is understandable (i.e. allowing for the continuous separation between religious organisations and the state in the EU countries where such organisations already operated under a special regime), it also restricts future beneficiaries of Article 91 GDPR\u2019s derogation. New religious groups, for example, cannot fulfil that condition because of the temporal limitation that it contains. As a result, it can be argued that Article 91 GDPR unduly discriminates between pre-established religious organisations and more recent or new religious groups. Because of the stringent character of that second condition, only a handful of religious organisations benefit in practice from the derogation contained in Article 91 GDPR. For example, the Jehovah Witnesses community of Finland did not have its own specific set of data protection rules in place prior to the entry into force of the GDPR. Hence, in case C-25/17 (mentioned above), the CJEU considered that the processing of personal data in the context of its door-to-door preaching activities was subject to EU data protection law. [ 5 ] As far as the Roman Catholic Church is concerned, the derogation of Article 91 GDPR would only apply in Poland and in Italy - two Member States where the Catholic Church took advantage of its special status to adopt their own specific set of binding data protection rules in 1997 [ 6 ] and 1999 [ 7 ] respectively, i.e. prior to the entry into force of the GDPR. By contrast, in other Member States, the Catholic Church did not adopt such rules and is thus subject to the GDPR. [ 8 ] As an illustration of this, in June 2020, an administrative court in Slovenia upheld a decision from the Slovenian DPA regarding the processing of personal data by a small parish of the Roman Catholic Church. [ 9 ] The case was initiated by an individual who had requested his personal data to be erased from the Baptismal Register, because he was no longer a member of the church. The parish claimed however that it was required to keep these data on the basis of the Protection of Documents and Archives and Archival Institutions Act, [ 10 ] which classifies the registry as archival material of outstanding national importance. The Slovenian DPA concluded that the parish did not violate data protection law by rejecting the request for erasure of the individual in question, because its archiving obligation prohibited such deletion. This decision was upheld by the administrative court in second instance. Even if the complaint of the individual was ultimately dismissed, this case shows that the parish in question was subject to the GDPR because, in Slovenia, the Roman Catholic Church did not adopt its own rules on data protection prior to 25 May 2016. Even in a situation when a religious organisation would have adopted its own set of data protection rules prior to 25 May 2016, Tosoni correctly argues that such special rules would in any case only operate \u201c as a lex specialis where such organisations process data for strictly religious purposes \u201d. [ 11 ] In other words, the processing operations that fall outside of the religious activities of the concerned organisations would remain subject to the GDPR. The third and final condition for the derogation of Article 91 GDPR to apply is that the lex specialis of the religious organisation must be \u201c comprehensive \u201d and \" brought in line with the GDPR\" . Thus, if it is found that the lex specialis of a religious association does not reach this level of completeness or was not brought in line with the GDPR, the latter will apply instead. To meet this condition, the Roman Catholic Church of Poland and Italy amended their existing data protection rules to bring them in line with the GDPR in 2018. [ 12 ] The applicable decrees provide, inter alia, that the Church must keep a record of processing activities, appoint a DPO and report data breaches when they occur. [ 13 ] The GDPR does not provide any clear indications as to the level of comprehensiveness and equivalence which must exist between the GDPR and the lex specialis . It can be assumed however that the general principles of data protection law as enshrined in Article 5 GDPR must be complied with, and that the rights of the data subjects as found in the GDPR must also be available under the lex specialis . In other words, there must exist a basic level of equivalence between the lex specialis and the GDPR. However, there may still be minor divergences from the GDPR when necessary to achieve the ultimate aim of the provision, which is to protect the independence of churches and religious associations or communities. Religious organisations that fulfil the requirements listed in Paragraph 1 and therefore continue to apply their special rules must be subject to the supervision of an independent supervisory authority. It can either be a specific authority established by a religious organisation itself, or the general DPA responsible for monitoring the application of the GDPR at the regional or national level. In both cases, all the conditions specified in Chapter VI GDPR relating to supervisory authorities must be met. For example, the authority must be sufficiently independent in line with Article 52 GDPR. In Poland, the Roman Catholic Church has made use of that possibility by establishing a specific supervisory authority in charge of monitoring the processing activities of the country\u2019s Church, referred to as the Church Data Protection Inspector ( Ko\u015bcielny Inspektor Ochrony Danych ). [ 14 ] Whether this authority meets all the requirements set in Chapter VI GDPR remains to be assessed. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 91 GDPR \u2191 Giovanni Buttarelli (EDPS), Personal Data Protection in churches and religious organisation: Speech to a Conference organised by the Polish Inspector for Personal Data Protection, Cardinal Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski University of Warsaw, Opole University and the University of Szczecin , Warsaw, 25 February 2016 (available here ) (accessed 14 March 2022). \u2191 In this sense Tosoni, who adds how \u201c in principle, the concepts of' churches and religious associations or communities should also be interpreted broadly. For instance, in the Jehovah, Witnesses case, the CJEU seems to (implicitly) recognise that the Jehovas Witnesses community should be considered a religious association or community for the purposes of Article 17 TFEU and the DPD, and the Advocate General's Opinion in the same case suggests that this may be true also under Article 91 GDPR \u201d.

That period shall be extended by three months at the initiative of the European Parliament or of the Council. This provision outlines the limits to the Commission's power to adopt delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\" TFEU \"), within the scope of the GDPR. [ 1 ] The function of Article 92 GDPR is to lay down conditions for the delegation of power as necessitated by Article\u00a0290\u00a0TFEU, such as its duration (Article 290(1) TFEU), its revocability (Article 290(2)(a) TFEU), and the dependence of the entry of force of individual delegated acts on the absence of objections by the Parliament and the Council (Article 290(2)(b) TFEU). Delegated acts are distinguishable from other types of acts which the Commission may adopt in relation to the GDPR, in particular the implementing acts found in Article 93 GDPR . [ 2 ] Under Article 290(1) TFEU, an EU legislative act may delegate the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of the legislative act to the Commission. Article 290(1) TFEU provides that \u201c the objectives, content, scope and duration of the delegation of power \u201d must be explicitly defined within the legislative act, which Article\u00a092 GDPR does through Articles\u00a012(8) and 43(8) GDPR. Nonetheless, the Article 290(1) TFEU restricts the delegation of power to 'non-essential' areas of the legislative provision in question. The \u201c essential elements of an area \u201d shall be reserved for the legislative act, and cannot be delegated to the Commission. In regard to the GDPR, the 'essential' legislative areas are the regulation and enforcement of data protection. The Commission may not legislate in these core areas, but is permitted to legislate for periphery matters which fall outside of the scope of areas considered 'essential.' In accordance with the framework established through Article 290 TFEU, Article 92 GDPR provides that the commission may make use of its delegated powers solely through Articles\u00a012(8) and 43(8) GDPR. The first delegation is provided for in Article 12(8) GDPR . This provision permits the Commission to adopts delegated acts in accordance with Article 92 for the purpose of determining the procedures for providing standardised icons and to determine the information to be displayed by icons. The second delegation is provided for through Article 43(8) GDPR , which empowers the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 92 for the purpose of specifying the requirements to be taken into account for the data protection certification mechanisms referred to in Article 42(1). Any delegated acts made under these provisions are inherently subject to the general principles governing delegated acts under Article\u00a092 GDPR, as well as to the principles of the Articles under which any delegated act is made. A delegated act may not contradict the GDPR's fundamental principles and objectives. The delegation of power provided for by Article 92(2) GDPR is for an 'indeterminate' period of time. Nonetheless, the wording of Article 290(1) TFEU requires that the 'duration' of the delegation must be provided for in the legislative act which confers the delegation of power. At first glance, Article 92 GDPR's wording seems to be in conflict with Article 290(1) TFEU, but in actuality it is not. Article 92(2) GDPR must be read in line with Article 92(3) GDPR, which provides that the Parliament and the Council may revoke the conferral of power at any time. This provision ensures that there can be no unlimited conferral. [ 3 ] In the instance that a revocation is made, it shall take effect the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union or at a later date specified therein. Should it be used to revoke the delegations granted in Articles 12(8) and 43(8) GDPR, the revocation will not affect the validity of any of the delegated acts that the Commission may have already adopted and which are in force up to that point. This, of course, does not preclude the possibility that the legislators (once the power has been resumed following revocation) may remove or amend the act issued by the Commission by an ordinary legislative act. As soon as it adopts a delegated act, the Commission shall notify it simultaneously to the European Parliament and to the Council. This notification triggers the start of the three-month period in which  Parliament and the Council may raise objections pursuant to Article 92(5) GDPR. [ 4 ] Article 92(5) GDPR imposes a further condition for the delegation of power, in line with Article\u00a0290(2)(b) TFEU. A delegated act only enters into force, if no objection has been expressed by either the European Parliament or the Council within the three-month notification period. The period may be extended by a further three months at the request of Parliament or the Council. If no objection has been expressed within this time frame, the delegated act enters into force following the expiry of the three-month period. (a) In the instance that the Parliament and Council inform the Commission of their intention not to object to the delegated act, the delegated act may be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and enters into force before the end of the three-month period. (b) In the instance that the Parliament and Council express the same objection, the original act is void and the Commission may seek to amend the proposed act. (c) In the instance that either the Parliament or the Council express an objection while the other remains silent, the Commission may choose to amend the act (if requested) and await a reaction from the other legislator. If there is no reaction within three months, the act is published in the Official Journal and enters into force. (d) In the instance that the Parliament and Council express separate objections or different positions on the same issue, this can be resolved either by the Commission renouncing the power of delegation, or via a dialogue between the two legislators. (e) In the instance that the Parliament and Council do not express any objections within the three-month notification period, the act enters into force. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 92 GDPR \u2191 Herbst in K\u00fchling, Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 92 GDPR, margin number 1 (C.H.

The Commission shall be assisted by a committee. That committee shall be a committee within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. 2.   Where reference is made to this paragraph, Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 shall apply. 3.   Where reference is made to this paragraph, Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, in conjunction with Article 5 thereof, shall apply. The GDPR provides for the Commission to adopt implementing acts within the meaning of Article 291(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\" TFEU \"). Implementing acts for the objectives of Article 291 TFEU serve the purpose of ensuring the uniform implementation of binding legal acts of the Union, in this instance, the GDPR. In principle, binding acts of the Union are implemented by each individual Member State in accordance with their national law (Article 291(1) TFEU). However, these implementing powers may be conferred upon the Commission in the absence of uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts (Article 291(2) TFEU). The purpose of Article 93 GDPR is to regulate this conferral. [ 1 ] In the instance where implementing acts are delegated to the Commission pursuant to Article\u00a0291\u00a0TFEU, Article 93(1) GDPR provides that the Commission shall be assisted by a committee. [ 2 ] This provision imposes a positive obligation upon the Commission to involve a committee in this process. According to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EU) No. 182/2011, the committee shall be composed of representatives of the Member States. [ 3 ] Implementing acts, functionally, take on a similar role as delegated acts (see Article 92 GDPR ) as non-legislative acts. Nonetheless, there are significant procedural differences in regard to their adoption. In the case of implementing acts, the Parliament and Council have no decisive power, unlike delegated acts made under Article 92 GDPR. [ 4 ] Article 93(2) GDPR explicitly provides for the application of Article 5 of Regulation\u00a0(EU)\u00a0No\u00a0182/2011, which establishes the procedure for the adoption of implementing acts. Notably, Article 93(2) exclusively refers to the \"examination procedure\" provided for in Article\u00a05 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. This procedure is generally foreseen for (a) implementing acts of general scope and (b) other implementing acts relating to programmes with substantial implications, including the intervention of a committee composed of representatives of each Member State. Recital 168 GDPR exhaustively lists the circumstances in which the Commission may adopt implementing acts. The Commission may adopt an implementing act pursuant to Article 28(7) GDPR (standard contractual clauses between controllers and processors and between processors); Article 40(9) GDPR (codes of conduct); Article 43(9) GDPR (technical standards and mechanisms for certification); Article 45(3) GDPR (the adequate level of protection afforded by a third country, a territory or a specified sector within that third country, or an international organisation), Article\u00a045(5)\u00a0GDPR (revocation, change of such determinations); Articles 46(2)(c) and (d) GDPR (standard protection clauses); Article 47(3) GDPR (formats and procedures for the exchange of information by electronic means between controllers, processors and supervisory authorities for binding corporate rules); Article 61(9) GDPR (mutual assistance); and lastly Article 67 GDPR (arrangements for the exchange of information by electronic means between supervisory authorities, and between supervisory authorities and the Board). The committee procedure is offset by a proposal made by the Commission regarding the measures to be taken. Follwing the Commission's proposal, the committee gives its opinion by a qualified majority vote (55% of the Member States representing at least 65% of the population). If the majority indicated in favour of the draft act (favourable opinion), the Commission adopts the implementing act. If not (negative opinion), the President of the Commission may submit an amended version to the Committee. If neither a favourable nor an unfavourable opinion is reached, the Commission may decide to adopt the implementing act regardless. By way of derogation from Articles 4 and 5, under Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No. 182/2011 a basic act may provide that the Commission adopts an implementing act which shall apply immediately, without prior submission to a committee, only on \"duly justified imperative grounds of urgency.\" An implementing act made pursuant to the urgency procedure will remain in force for a maximum period of 6 months, unless the basic act provides otherwise. At the latest, 14 days after its adoption, the chair shall submit the urgent act to the relevant committee in order to obtain its opinion. Recital 159 of the GDPR provides for the only case of \u201cimperative urgency\u201d. In particular, it notes that \u201c [t] he Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where available evidence reveals that a third country, a territory or a specified sector within that third country, or an international organisation does not ensure an adequate level of protection, and imperative grounds of urgency so require.\u201d \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 93 GDPR \u2191 Herbst in K\u00fchling, Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 93 GDPR, margin number 1 (C.H.

The heading of Chapter X (\u201c Delegated Acts and Implementing Acts \u201d), which consists only of Articles 92 and 93, may at first suggest that the provision is also related to delegated acts, but is misleading in this respect. \u2191 For further discussion on this point, see Herbst in K\u00fchling, Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 93 GDPR, margin numbers 2-3 (C.H.

1.   Directive 95/46/EC is repealed with effect from 25 May 2018. 2.   References to the repealed Directive shall be construed as references to this Regulation. References to the Working Party on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data established by Article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC shall be construed as references to the European Data Protection Board established by this Regulation. Article 94 GDPR repeals Directive\u00a095/46/EC and brings into effect the GDPR on the same date - 25 May 2018. Consequently, any data processing that took place from 25 May 2018 is no longer regulated by Directive\u00a095/46/EC, but by the GDPR. This provision is to be differentiated from Article 99(1) GDPR , which entered the Regulation into force on 25 May 2016, generating a two-year transition period between the Regulation's entry into force and date of effect under Article 94 GDPR. [ 1 ] In order to ensure a sense of continuity within the regulatory framework, Article 94(2) GDPR provides that any reference to Directive\u00a095/46/EC shall be replaced by a reference to the GDPR. The same approach is adopted for references to Working Party 29, which from the date of effect are to be understood as references to the European Data Protection Board ( EDPB). Nonetheless, questions arise in relation to data processed before the Regulation's date of effect (25 May 2018). Recital 171 seeks to address such issues of transition. It establishes that processing operations which have been in place prior to the Regulation's date of effect must ensure that processing is compliant with the GDPR. In particular, Recital 171 notes that processing reliant on consent as a legal basis under Directive\u00a095/46/EC may continue to rely on the same consent given prior to the GDPR's date of effect. In practice, this provision establishes that it is not necessary for the data subject to give their consent once again following the Regulation's date of effect, so long as the conditions under which consent was originally given were compliant with the conditions outlined under the GDPR. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 94 GDPR \u2191 K\u00fchling, Raab , in K\u00fchling, Buchner, GVO BDSG, Article 94 GDPR, margin numbers 2-4 (C.

Article 95 GDPR regulates the relationship between the GDPR and Directive 2002/58/EC (the \u2018e-Privacy Directive\u2019 or \u2018EPD\u2019), which contains rules on the privacy and confidentiality of electronic communications. According to this provision, the GDPR should not impose additional obligations on natural or legal persons - in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communication services in public communication networks - who are already subject to specific obligations with the same objective under the EPD. There was no equivalent to Article 95 GDPR in its predecessor, Directive 95/46/EC (the Data Protection Directive, 'DPD'). Nonetheless, the regulation of the relationship between the GDPR and the EPD is to be found in Recital 10 and Article 1(2) EPD. [ 1 ] Article 1(2) EPD provides that the EPD's provisions serve to \"particularise and complement Directive 95/46/EC.\" This provision must be read in-line with Recital 10, which establishes that Directive 95/46/EC applies to matters not covered by the provisions of the EPD. Given that Article\u00a094\u00a0GDPR repeals Directive 95/46/EC and replaces it with the Regulation, the aforementioned provisions of the EPD are to be relied upon in addition to Article 95 GDPR, when determing questions concerning the relationship between the GDPR and the EPD. Article 95 follows the lex specialis rule of interpretation, whereby a specific law overrides a more general law when regulating the same set of facts. On one hand, the application of this principle to both laws is simple: the EPD specifically governs electronic communications, and therefore supersedes the GDPR, which contains more general provisions on data processing. [ 2 ] On the other hand, it should be noted that in some ways the EPD is not more specific than the GDPR. For example, whilst the GDPR only protects natural persons in relation to the processing of their personal data, the EPD also protects the legitimate interests of legal persons. [ 3 ] Moreover, whilst the GDPR specifically protects personal data in accordance with Article 8 of the Charter, the EPD more broadly protects the privacy and confidentiality of electronic communications in line with Article 7 of the Charter. In this way, as K\u00fchling and Raab note, \u201cthe challenge in each case is to check whether the special provisions of [the] Directive [if any, n.e.] actually supersede the general rules of the GDPR.\u201d [ 4 ] Article 95 GDPR specifies that additional obligations must not be placed on natural or legal persons. This reflects the scope of the EPD, which in turn stems from Article 7 of the Charter. In particular, the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (\" CJEU \") has established that professional persons\u2019 legal activities should not be excluded from the protection afforded by Article 7 of the Charter. [ 5 ] The processing subject to Article 95 GDPR must be connected to the provision of a \u2018publicly available electronic communications service.\u2019 The CJEU had previously ruled that a service may only be classified as an electronic communication service where it is responsible for the transmission of the signal over the communication network to the user. [ 6 ] Whilst this will be the case for classic telecommunications services, it will not for those which operate on the open internet. However, under the the European Electronic Communications Code (\" EECC \"), this is no longer a requirement. The EECC creates a distinct category of electronic communication services known as \u2018interpersonal communication services.\u2019 According to Kuhling and Raab , this category is \u201c clearly tailored to internet communication services\u201d such as Whatsapp and Skype. Notably, under Article 2(5) EECC, a service will not qualify as an electronic communication service where the communication function is merely ancillary. [ 7 ] The electronic communication service must also be provided through a \u2018public communications network\u2019. Neither the EPD nor the GDPR provide for a definition of a \u2018public communications network.\u2019 The EECC outlines that an electronic communications network is public, where it is \u201cwholly or mainly used to provide publicly accessible electronic communication services that enable the transmission of information between network termination points.\u201d Therefore, a public communications network would not cover a closed company communications network, whereby employees only interact with each other. [ 8 ] In such a situation, Article 95 GDPR will not be relevant, and the GDPR applies as normal. Notably, Recital 173 GDPR, which relates to Article 95 GDPR, omits reference to \u2018publicly accessible electronic communication services in public communication networks\u2019, stating that the GDPR should only apply to matters which are not subject to specific obligations with the same objectives under the EPD. Article 95 GDPR\u2019s explicit reference to \u2018publicly accessible electronic communication services in public communication networks\u2019 in this context can cause problems of interpretation. Namely, the question arises as to what data protection obligations do not involve the provision of publicly accessible electronic services in public communications networks. [ 9 ] A key example is Article 5(3) EPD, which regulates the placement of cookies and other similar tracking technologies. Rather than applying only to publicly accessible electronic communications services, Article 5(3) EPD applies to any entity that places cookies or other code on a user\u2019s device. Services may therefore be subject to additional obligations under the GDPR in this instance. [ 10 ] In order not to be subject to additional obligations under the GDPR, processing must be related to matters which are subject to specific obligations with the same objective set out in the EPD. For example, Article 4(1)(a) EPD requires service providers to put in place measures to ensure the protection of personal data, and Article 4(3) GDPR requires service providers to notify the relevant authority where a data breach occurs. In line with Article 95 GDPR, since these objectives are mirrored in the GDPR, it will therefore not impose additional obligations on service providers. [ 11 ] In contrast, where the EPD does not contain comparative provisions, additional obligations under the GDPR will apply. For example, the EPD contains no provisions with regard to data subject rights (Chapter III GDPR), nor consent (Article 7 GDPR). [ 12 ] Under Recital 173 GDPR, once the GDPR is adopted, the EPD should be reviewed in order to ensure consistency with it. The Commission adopted such a proposal for the EPD on 19 January 2017.

International agreements involving the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations which were concluded by Member States prior to 24 May 2016, and which comply with Union law as applicable prior to that date, shall remain in force until amended, replaced or revoked. Article 96 GDPR acts as a transitionary clause for international agreements involving the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations which were concluded by Member States prior to 24 May 2016, and which comply with Union law as applicable prior to that date. It provides that these shall remain in force until amended, replaced or revoked. [ 1 ] In order to benefit from this special legal \"protection\", the international agreement must \" comply with Union law as applicable prior to that date \" (24 May 2016). In other words, the parameter of legitimacy is not the GDPR but the law applicable in the European Union before its adoption. This includes primary legislation such as Article 16 Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\" TFEU \"), Articles 7, 8 and 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union  (\" CFR \"), as well as Directive 95/46/EC. In the event that such verification is successful, the agreement will remain in force \"notwithstanding any potential incompatibility with other provisions of the GDPR \u201d.  The above is true \u201c until \" the international agreement is \" amended, replaced or revoked .\u201d It follows that where an agreement is replaced or revoked, it will then no longer be protected by Article 96 GDPR if it is found to be incompatible with other GDPR provisions. [ 2 ] \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 96 GDPR \u2191 It follows that any international agreement concluded after that date does not fall within the scope of this provision.

1.   By 25 May 2020 and every four years thereafter, the Commission shall submit a report on the evaluation and review of this Regulation to the European Parliament and to the Council. The reports shall be made public. 2.   In the context of the evaluations and reviews referred to in paragraph 1, the Commission shall examine, in particular, the application and functioning of: 3.   For the purpose of paragraph 1, the Commission may request information from Member States and supervisory authorities. 4.   In carrying out the evaluations and reviews referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Commission shall take into account the positions and findings of the European Parliament, of the Council, and of other relevant bodies or sources. 5.   The Commission shall, if necessary, submit appropriate proposals to amend this Regulation, in particular taking into account of developments in information technology and in the light of the state of progress in the information society. There are no relevant recitals for Article 97 GDPR. Article 97 GDPR imposes a \"comprehensive reporting obligation\" upon the Commission. [ 1 ] The first paragraph of Article 97 GDPR sets out the time-frame for the Commission's reporting obligations to the European Parliament and the Council, which is to be fulfilled every four years, as well as imposing a formal publication obligation upon the Commission. The second paragraph sets out the content of the Commission's reports made under Article 97 GDPR, which is to examine the application and functioning of Chapters V and VII of the Regulation. Under Article 97(2)(a) GDPR, the Commission's report must look to the functioning of existing adequacy decisions (Article 45(3) GDPR), regardless of whether they were adopted under the previous regulatory framework (Article 25(6) Directive 95/46/EC or 'DPD'). [ 2 ] The next provision of Article 97(2) GDPR, paragraph (b), establishes Chapter VII of the Regulation as another area which the Commission must report upon. Chapter VII relates to the cooperation and consistency mechanisms. The inclusion of Chapter V on the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations was raised in Trilogue proceedings following the annulment of the Safe Harbour Agreement by the Court of Justice of the European Union (\" CJEU \"). [ 3 ] Zedrick notes that as a direct result of the Schrems I case, [ 4 ] European legislators sought to implement a system whereby each adequacy decision would be subject to a mechanism of periodic review, every four years as per Article 45(3)\u00a0GDPR, and subject to regular reporting, which Article\u00a097(2)\u00a0GDPR provides for. [ 5 ] The third paragraph of Article 97 GDPR, obliges the Commission to take into account the opinions of Member States and Supervisory Authorites in the fulfillment of its reporting obligations. While the fourth paragraph of the provision obliges the Commission to also take into account the opinions of \"relevant bodies or sources,\" in particular, explicitly listed are the European Parliament and the Council. Lastly, paragraph five of Article 97 GDPR encompasses the overall aim of the Article - to allow for the Regulation to keep pace with rapid technological advancements. Article\u00a097(5)\u00a0GDPR establishes that once the Commission has carried out its assessment and reporting obligations, it may propose amendments to the GDPR, if it considers them to be necessary to align the existing legislation with developments in information technology and information society (Article 17(2) of the Treaty on European Union).

The Commission shall, if appropriate, submit legislative proposals with a view to amending other Union legal acts on the protection of personal data, in order to ensure uniform and consistent protection of natural persons with regard to processing. This shall in particular concern the rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to processing by Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data. The aim of Article\u00a098\u00a0GDPR is to ensure the adaptation of Union Acts relating to data protection in a manner which corresponds with the GDPR's regulatory framework. [ 1 ] Given that data protection affects several different sectors, each of which have their own characteristics, questions arise when considering which legal Union Acts this provision extends to. In this regard, the GDPR refers to certain legal instruments that also have to be taken into consideration under Article\u00a098\u00a0GDPR. [ 2 ] However, beyond Acts explicitly referred to in the GDPR's text, there remains a degree of discrepancy regarding whether other Acts relating to data protection fall within the scope of Article\u00a098\u00a0GDPR. Commentators have argued in favour of a broad reading of the provision, suggesting that the Commission should review all EU legislation which addresses data protection, including more specific acts, such as the Anti-Money Laundering Directive and the Europol Regulation. [ 3 ] Noting that a broader reading of Article\u00a098\u00a0GDPR is supported by the wording of Article\u00a02(3)\u00a0GDPR, which provides that: ' For the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 applies. Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and other Union legal acts applicable to such processing of personal data shall be adapted to the principles and rules of this Regulation in accordance with Article 98 '. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 98 GDPR The CJEU has yet to rule on Article 98 GDPR. Nonetheless, the opinion of Attorney General Bobek in Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration paysanne and Others , has suggested that there exists a wider constitutional duty for Union legislation to be 'technically and socially responsive, and, provided that it is necessary in view of later evolution, to be updated'. [ 4 ] The CJEU has not yet explicitly confirmed the existence of this duty; however, it has been alluded to in Agrarproduktion Staebelow . [ 5 ] \u2191 K\u00fchling, Raab , in K\u00fchling, Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 98 GDPR, margin number 2 (Beck 2020, 3rd edition). \u2191 Some examples are: the ePrivacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EG), which formulates more specific rules for the processing personal data occurring in the context of electronic communications, which supersede the GDPR(see Article 95 GDPR); the e-Commerce Directive (Directive 2000/31/EG), especially in the context of liability and responsibility of hosting, caching and content providers (see Article 2(4) GDPR); the Directive on the Re-use of Public Sector Information (Directive 2003/98/EC amended by Directive 2013/37/EU) regarding documents that are not or only partially accessible for reasons of data protection (see Recital 154 GDPR); the Regulation on Community Statistics on Public Health and Safety at Work (Regulation (EC) No 1338/2008), especially regarding its relevant definitions as well as the interpretation of \u201cpublic health\u201d for the GDPR (see Recital 54 sentence 3 GDPR); the Directive on Patients' Rights in Cross-Border Healthcare (Directive 2011/24/EU), regarding personal data processed within healthcare services and patients\u2019 access rights to their files (see Recital 35 sentence 2 GDPR); the Regulation on Clinical Trials on Medicinal Products for Human Use (Regulation (EU) No 536/2014), which includes special provisions in cases of consent to participation in clinical trials (see Recital 161 GDPR); and lastly, the Regulation on European Statistics (Regulation (EC) No 223/2009), which provides special rules regarding confidential information which is, at the same time, personal data as well (see Recital 163 GDPR). \u2191 Tosoni in Kuner et al., The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Article 98 GDPR, p. 1315 (Oxford University Press 2020). \u2191 Case C- 528/ 16, Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration paysanne (AG Opinion), para 139. \u2191 Case C-504/ 04, para 40.

1.   This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. 2.   It shall apply from 25 May 2018. There is no relevant recital for Article 99 GDPR. Article 99 GDPR sets out the dates of the Regulation's entry into force and application. The first paragraph of the provision notes that the GDPR will enter into force on the 20th day after its publication in the Official Journal of the EU (following the basic rule provided for in Article 297(1) Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\" TFEU \")). As it was published in the Official Gazette on 4 May 2016, the Regulation entered into force on 24\u00a0May\u00a02016. The second paragraph establishes that the Regulation shall apply from 25 May 2018. The Regulation's date of application was deliberately made to be later than its entry into force, for the purpose of creating a two-year transition period, which allowed for Member States to adapt their national laws to the new requirements, as well as allowing for other addressees of the Regulation (such as controllers and processors) to bring their operations into compliance with the GDPR. [ 1 ] Notably though, for churches and religious associations or communities, rules issued up to 24\u00a0May\u00a02016 could continue to apply, provided they were adapted to the requirements of the GDPR (for greater analysis on this point, see Article 91 GDPR ). In addition, the Commission was able to issue delegated acts in accordance with Article 92 GDPR during this period. \u2192 You can find all related decisions in Category:Article 99 GDPR \u2191 K\u00fchling, Raab , in K\u00fchling, Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, Article 99 GDPR, margin number 4 (Beck 2020, 3rd edition).",

Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation shall be prohibited. 2.   Paragraph 1 shall not apply if one of the following applies: 3.   Personal data referred to in paragraph 1 may be processed for the purposes referred to in point (h) of paragraph 2 when those data are processed by or under the responsibility of a professional subject to the obligation of professional secrecy under Union or Member State law or rules established by national competent bodies or by another person also subject to an obligation of secrecy under Union or Member State law or rules established by national competent bodies. 4.   Member States may maintain or introduce further conditions, including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic data, biometric data or data concerning health. Article 9(1) GDPR contains a general prohibition for the processing of special categories of data; that is, data that the legislator has considered to be particularly sensitive for different reasons. Under Article 9(2) GDPR such general prohibition is excluded when certain requirements are met. Article 9(3) GDPR lays down specific indications for processing carried out in the context of professional or institutional activities. Finally, Article 9(4) GDPR allows Member States to maintain or introduce further conditions, including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic data, biometric data or data concerning health. Article 9(1) GDPR provides a list of special categories of personal data whose processing is generally prohibited unless any of the exceptions under Article 9(2) GDPR applies. The list is exhaustive [ 1 ] and includes data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation. In general terms, the prohibition of processing shall apply to all data revealing sensitive aspects. These categories are meant to be interpreted broadly [ 2 ] and, according to some authors, not only cover data directly containing sensitive information (i.e. a trade union's badge, or a clinical record) but also data from which sensitive information can be inferred. Take, for instance, the online support given to a political demonstration, or a video footage showing the person accessing a certain hospital department. In both cases, it is argued, the information reveals something sensitive about the individual (either their political views, or a health condition) and should be treated accordingly. [ 3 ] \"[T]he purpose of Article 9(1) [GDPR] is to ensure enhanced protection as regards processing which, because of the particular sensitivity of the data processed, is liable to constitute a particularly serious interference with the fundamental rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data, guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter [...]. Such enhanced protection necessarily calls for a broad definition of such \u2018sensitive data\u2019. Thus, the Court has held that Article 9(1) of the GDPR applies to processing not only of inherently sensitive data to which that provision relates, but also of data revealing information of that nature indirectly, following an intellectual operation involving deduction or cross-referencing[...].\" CJEU - C-492/23 - Russmedia , margin number 51 et seq. with further references.. This category recognises and expresses the intention to protect the principle of non-discrimination and cultural diversity typical of any modern society. While the characteristic of \"racial origin\" is based on biological ancestry and hereditary characteristics, \"ethnic origin\" focuses more on the cultural aspects that characterise a group of people. These include language, history, tradition, shared values and a sense of togetherness. [ 4 ] However, the use of the term \u201cracial\u201d in no way means that the GDPR or the European Union accepts a definition, or even worse the existence of, any \u201crace\u201d . This assumption has already been made clear by the WP29, [ 5 ] and subsequently confirmed by Recital 51 GDPR: \u201c the use of the term \u2018racial origin\u2019 in this Regulation does not imply an acceptance by the Union of theories which attempt to determine the existence of separate human races \u201d. Rather, the special protection is intended to counteract such theories. [ 6 ] The GDPR does not provide a definition of the expression \"political opinion\". It seems clear, however, that any type of clear, unambiguous statement, support or, as the case may be, rejection [ 7 ] of a political party or of an ideological organization, any subscription to a politically oriented magazine, or participation in offline and online petitions, meetings or demonstrations, most likely amount to \"political opinion\" . [ 8 ] Conversely, opinions that focus on purely commercial facts or exclusively express a private interest, without reference to a public debate or the functioning of a democratic and pluralistic society, are excluded from the definition. [ 9 ] In cases of doubt, a broad understanding of the term \"political opinion\" is appropriate in order not to jeopardize the foundations of political opinion-forming. [ 10 ] For these reasons, a fairly large number of activities are covered by the processing ban with regard to political opinions. They range, for example, from subscriber lists of political party magazines and lists of participants at political events or demonstrations, to expressions of interest or approval for political groups in social networks (such as the \"Like\" on Facebook) as long as they reflect a reliable conclusion on a political opinion. [ 11 ] The protection of religious beliefs aims to protect not only \"traditional\" religious affiliations but also other secular views (e.g. pacifism, socialism). Followers of natural religions or sects, atheists, anthroposophists, or members of ideological organizations, as well as Christians, Muslims and Buddhists all have a right to legal protection which guarantees that information about their convictions may only be processed under special conditions. Expression of Article 28 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, this category reflects the importance of trade unions' role in protecting workers' dignity and labour conditions. By restricting the processing of this type of data, this provision reduces the risk of employer retaliations based on trade union membership. [ 12 ] This category refers to membership as well as activities activities that reveal a close connection to a trade union. These include, among others, status as a union representative, documents showing a certain union membership, participation in the foundation of a union, as well as daily handling of union affairs. Depending on the individual case\u2019s circumstances, the subscription to a trade union publication, the distribution of trade union documents (publications, advertising material) or even the expression of interest in the activities of a trade union (e.g. reading the notices, talking to a union member at the trade union stand), [ 13 ] may also benefit from this special protection under Article 9(1) GDPR. A definition of genetic data can be found in Article 4(13) GDPR . It includes any personal data relating to the inherited or acquired genetic characteristics of a natural person which give unique information about the physiology or the health of that natural person, and which result, in particular, from an analysis of a biological sample from the natural person in question. A definition of biometric data can be found in Article 4(14)GDPR . It refers to personal data resulting from specific technical processing relating to the physical, physiological or behavioural characteristics of a natural person, which allow or confirm the unique identification of that natural person, such as facial images or dactyloscopic data. With regard to biometric data , it should be noted that Article 9(1) only prohibits their processing \"for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person\". Therefore, the processing of biometric data for other purposes does not fall under the general prohibition of processing. According to Petri, the exact meaning of \" uniquely identifying \" is to be based on the processing method and the respective state of the art, but above all on the individual case\u2019s circumstances , and in particular, the nature of the data processed. [ 14 ] Article 4(15) GDPR defines health data as any personal data related to the physical or mental health of a natural person, including the provision of health care services, which reveal information about his or her health status. In this way, for example, the Austrian DPA has held that negative PCR (SARS_CoV-2) tests should be classified as health data. [ 15 ] This category may also include data on special needs of students which qualify as health data too. [ 16 ] EDPB Guidelines: on this provision there are EDPB Guidelines 03/2020 on the processing of data concerning health for the purpose of scientific research in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak \"[S]pecial categories of personal data, listed in [...] Article 9(1) of the GDPR, include data concerning health. Those data cover, in accordance with Article 4(15) of that regulation, read in conjunction with recital 35 of that regulation, all personal data which reveal information relating to the past, present or future health status of a natural person, including data relating to the provision of healthcare services to that person. [...] Consequently, the information which customers of an operator of a pharmacy enter when ordering online pharmacy-only medicinal products the sale of which does not require a prescription constitutes data concerning health, within the meaning of [...] Article 9(1) of the GDPR, even where it is only with a certain degree of probability, and not with absolute certainty, that those medicinal products are intended for those customers.\" CJEU - C\u201121/23 - Lindenapotheke , margin number 76 and 90.. The special protection afforded to personal data concerning sex life and sexual orientation essentially reflects the EU\u2019s interest in fighting any sort of discrimination based on these factors as established in Article 21 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. This includes information relating to heterosexuality, bisexuality, homosexuality and transsexuality, such as information about an intended gender change, one that has already taken place, living in a registered civil partnership or in a same-sex marriage. It also protects information related to sexual practices, as well as other acts that may reveal sexual orientation. Even the abstention from sexual practices may be considered sensitive data. [ 17 ] In accordance to Recital 51 GDPR, when processing data pursuant to Article 9 GDPR, not only do the conditions within this article apply, but so do the general principles and other rules of the GDPR as well. This means that not only do the principles in Article 5 GDPR apply, but that the conditions for lawful processing also apply. Therefore, the processing of special categories of personal data must not only be based on one of the exceptions and requirements from Article 9(2) and Article 9 (3) GDPR, but will also require an additional concomitant legal basis contained in Article 6(1) GDPR . [ 18 ] However, four exceptions for processing special categories of data established in Article 9(2)(a) GDPR, Article 9(2)(c) GDPR, Article 9(2)(g) GDPR and Article 9(2)(i) GDPR directly correlate with a specific legal basis laid out in Article 6(1) GDPR, while offering an even stricter and better protection. Therefore, it can be interpreted that these exceptions in Article 9(2) GDPR related to explicit consent, vital interests of a person physically or legally unable to give consent, and public interest, subsume the corresponding legal basis contained in Article 6(1)(a) GDPR, 6(1)(d) GDPR and 6(1)(e) GDPR respectively, and would require no additional correlation. The other six exceptions listed in Article 9(2) GDPR would require an additional legal basis pursuant to Article 6(1) GDPR. In accordance with Article 9(2) GDPR, special categories of data can only be processed when meeting one of the exceptions listed. These exceptions are independent of each other and must therefore be assessed independently. If the conditions for  one of the exceptions are not met, a controller can therefore rely on another exception listed in Article 9(2). [ 19 ] The CJEU has emphasized the application of the doctrine singularia non sunt extendenda to these exceptions, urging a strict interpretation. [ 20 ] The first exception, under letter (a), is obtaining the explicit consent of the data subject. As opposed to the simple consent established as a legal basis in Article 6(1)(a) GDPR , the explicit consent in Article 9(2)(a) GDPR is a qualified type that requires a higher level of precision and will from the data subject. Explicit consent will need a clearly affirmative action separate from other transactions. [ 21 ] Additionally, the data subject must give an express statement of consent. [ 22 ] Consent will also need to meet all the other requirements in Article 7 GDPR . Although they are not equivalent, as we have mentioned before, there is a definite correlation between the consent established in Article 6(1)(a) GDPR and the explicit consent in Article 9(2)(a). For example, in a recent decision, the Norwegian DPA has held that it is not possible to rely on this exception when consent is not valid under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR . [ 23 ] The second exception, under letter (b), is related to processing by employers that is necessary for the purposes of carrying out obligations and exercising specific rights of the controller or of the data subject in the field of employment and social security and social protection law. These obligations and rights must be provided by law or by a collective agreement, and include appropriate safeguards. Biometric and health data play an important role in this exception, and the necessity principle is key to avoid overuse. [ 24 ] For example, the Dutch DPA has held that the processing of special categories of data \u2013 health data in this particular case \u2013 must be strictly necessary to achieve what is stated in the law; when the processing of certain categories of health data is not really necessary to comply with the legal obligation, the controller cannot rely on this exception for those categories. [ 25 ] Thirdly, and similarly to the legal basis from Article 6(d) GDPR , Article 9(2) GDPR provides, under letter (c), an exception to the processing of special categories of data when the processing is necessary for the protection of the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent. As specified by Recital 46 GDPR, the processing of personal data based on the vital interest of another natural person shall take place only where the processing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis. The fourth exception, under letter (d), is for the processing carried out in the course of its legitimate activities with appropriate safeguards by a foundation, association or any other not-for-profit body with a political, philosophical, religious or trade union aim. Such bodies shall only carry out the processing internally, and the processing shall relate to members or former members. The rationale behind this exception is that often such bodies are intrinsically related with personal data that fall under the categories of Article 9 GDPR. The fifth exception, under letter (e), makes reference to data that is manifestly made public. The word \u201cmanifestly\u201d implies that the data subject must affirmatively make the data public, and must be aware of the result of such publicity. The mere presence of the data in a public space does not necessarily imply that it has been manifestly made public in this sense. [ 26 ] \"It follows that, for the purposes of the application of the exception laid down in Article 9(2)(e) of the GDPR, it is important to ascertain whether the data subject had intended, explicitly and by a clear affirmative action, to make the personal data in question accessible to the general public [...]\" CJEU - C-446/21 - Schrems v Facebook Ireland (2021) , margin number 77.. The Norwegian DPA has considered, for example, that making use of a LGTBQ dating app does not amount to manifestly making public data about sexual orientation, since the data is mainly only visible to other members of the LGTBQ community, as it is necessary to have an account too in order to access that data. Additionally, the app gives you the option of using an anonymous profile, and the app does not provide a clear warning stating the public nature of any information on the data subject\u2019s profile. [ 27 ] Contrary, the CJEU couldn't rule out that a data subject's statement about their sexual orientation during a panel discussion which was subsequently published on YouTube could constitute an act by which the data subject manifestly made his sexual orientation public. [ 28 ] The exception for information manifestly made public has another important limitation. The fact that a data subject manifestly makes public specific information in accordance with Article 9(2) GDPR does not mean that other personal data relating to the special category of data also lose the special protection stipulated in Article 9(1) GDPR. This would be contrary to the restrictive interpretation of the exceptions listed in Article 9(2) GDPR. [ 29 ] Neither can the fact that a data subject published personal data covered by Article 9(1) GDPR be interpreted as a consent within the meaning of Article 9(2)(a) GDPR for the processing of other data relating to special categories of data. [ 30 ] The sixth exception, under letter (f), relates to legal claims and judicial activities, that in many cases require the processing of certainly sensitive data. While the concept of legal claims and judicial activities is to be interpreted broadly in order to include every type of legal claim, since the term is not further specified. The exception itself, however, should be interpreted restrictively, meaning that it will only be applicable to legal claims or activities, as well as to immediate preparatory acts. [ 31 ] The seventh exception, under letter (g), allows for the processing of special categories of data when there is a substantial public interest involved. The processing shall be carried out on the basis of Union or Member State law, and shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject. The right must be itself enshrined in the law, which satisfy the principle of certainty, and define the necessary safeguards. [ 32 ] Recital 46 GDPR provides, as an example, \" processing that is necessary for humanitarian purposes, including for monitoring epidemics and their spread or in situations of humanitarian emergencies, in particular in situations of natural and man-made disasters .\" The eighth exception, under letter (h), includes the processing of data that is necessary for medicinal purposes and for the provision of health services. Medicinal purposes entail preventive or occupational medicine, the assessment of the working capacity of the employee, or medical diagnosis. The management of health systems and services includes the provision of health or social care or treatment. The processing must be carried out on the basis of Union or Member State law or pursuant to a contract with a health professional. Additionally, Article 9(3) GDPR establishes a supplementary condition: the data shall be processed by or under the responsibility of a professional subject to the obligation of professional secrecy. The ninth exception, under letter (i), includes data processed for the public interest in the area of the public health. An example of such public interest can be processing of personal data with the aim of protecting against serious cross-border threats to health or ensuring high standards of quality and safety of health care and of medicinal products or medical devices. This must be done on the basis of Union or Member State law which provides for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject, in particular professional secrecy. These measures must be effective and must be provided by law. For example, the French Highest Administrative Court declared that a decree was unlawful due to the absence of sufficient guarantees to ensure that access to the processed health data did not exceed that which is strictly necessary for the exercise of the mission recognised by law. [ 33 ] The last exception, under letter (j), includes processing that is necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes. This shall be based on Union or Member State law and shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject. For example, the Austrian DPA has held that labelling a person as \" extreme right-wing \" in a blog for the purpose of scientific research on the history of fascism and National Socialism, political manifestations of right-wing extremism and the resistance to the latter movements, including also the purpose of documentation and archiving (especially when such person has taken a basic political stance and repeatedly expressed this publicly), falls under this exception. [ 34 ] Data processed necessarily for medicinal purposes or for the management of health systems and services under the exception from Article 9(2)(h) GDPR, shall be processed by or under the responsibility of a professional subject to the obligation of professional secrecy. The obligation of professional secrecy must be provided by national law and must be statutory. For example, the Swedish DPA has established that a confidentially contract cannot replace statutory professional secrecy on the grounds that confidentially obligations are not strict enough. [ 35 ] According to Article 9(4) GDPR Member States may maintain or introduce further conditions, including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic data, biometric data or data concerning health. Member States are not allowed to introduce additional legal bases or lower the level of protection for special categories of personal data. For example, Germany has introduced rules regarding consent in a genetic examination or analysis, [ 36 ] protection for biometric data in passports and identity cards, that must be secured against unauthorized modification, deletion and readout, [ 37 ] the processing of personal data of organ donors, [ 38 ] and on data protection in the public health insurance and related associations.
