The data subject objected to this policy, arguing that forcing card payments unnecessarily involves the processing of personal data and infringes his right to privacy. He therefore filed a complaint with the DPA.\nThe DPA rejected the complaint following investigation, concluding that no likely violation of the GDPR occurred. It considered that card payments were used to ensure employee safety and to enable the performance of the contract with customers. The court of first instance upheld this view. The data subject then appealed to the Council of State, arguing that the DPA had failed to properly assess whether the processing was necessary and justified, and that less intrusive alternatives, such as allowing cash payments, were available.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe court held that the DPA’s decision was insufficiently reasoned and therefore unlawful. The court clarified that compliance with the GDPR generally implies compliance with Articles 7 and 8 of the EU Charter and Article 8 ECHR, so no separate human-rights analysis was required.\nWhile the court accepted that “(social) safety” can in principle constitute a legitimate and well-defined purpose for processing personal data under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, it emphasised that such a purpose must be substantiated in the specific circumstances of the case. In this instance, the data subject had credibly argued that staff safety was not actually at risk, and the DPA had failed to demonstrate that abolishing cash payments materially improved employee safety. The mere fact that cash can be stolen was not sufficient to establish a concrete and justified purpose.\nBecause the existence of a legitimate purpose had not been adequately established, the DPA could not properly assess whether the processing was necessary for the performance of the contract or whether it was proportionate. As a result, the court annulled the DPA’s decision and ordered it to adopt a new decision that properly assesses the legitimacy of the purpose relied upon."

However, Wolt failed to inform the complainant how he could verify his identity and failed to issue a timely refusal.\nDespite finding an infringement, the DPA did not issue a corrective order, considering that the failure resulted from human error, that Wolt had internal procedures in place, and that it had subsequently contacted the complainant to enable access.

Where third parties, such as landlords or banks, merely take a score into account alongside other factors, the necessary causal link is missing. Referring to the CJEU’s judgment in C-634/21 (SCHUFA), the court stressed that Article 22 GDPR applies only where the automated result plays a decisive role in the final decision, which must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\nBecause the data subject failed to show that any automated score had directly caused a concrete adverse decision, all related claims, including injunctive relief, damages under Article 82 GDPR, and expanded access rights, were dismissed.\nIt must be pointed out that this judgement is not binding yet."

        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nThe data subjects purchased a package trip for three adults and two children through the website of the controller, a travel agency. During the booking process and subsequent correspondence, errors arose concerning the children’s dates of birth, which were reflected in the contract and later in the travel documents. Although some corrections were made by hand in the contract and passport copies were eventually provided, the inaccurate data were not rectified in time, and the trip ultimately did not take place.\nFollowing this, the data subjects lodged a complaint with the DPA. They argued that the company had sent post-trip feedback emails without valid consent or an opt-out option, unlawfully processed and retained copies of travelers’ passports without demonstrating necessity or proportionality, failed to ensure the accuracy of personal data despite having access to corrected information, and acted without sufficient transparency by sending a third party’s privacy policy without explanation and by allegedly mishandling information about the recording of a telephone call. In addition, one data subject claimed that the response to an access request under Article 15 GDPR was incomplete and misleading, while another data subject alleged that their access request had not been answered at all.\nThe company argued that customers were contractually responsible for the accuracy of the data they provided, that passport copies were necessary to verify document validity for the trip, and that feedback emails were lawfully sent to existing customers under national electronic communications law. It also argued that the access request had been answered within the statutory time limit.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe DPA upheld the complaint for the most part. \nIt first concluded that the feedback emails sent to the data subjects constituted direct marketing under Lithuanian law. While such messages may be sent to existing customers, the company had failed to provide a clear and easily exercisable option to object at the time of data collection or in the emails themselves. \nWith regard to passport copies, the DPA found that the company had not demonstrated that collecting and continuing to process full copies of identity documents was necessary and proportionate for the performance of the travel contract. Although verification of document validity could in principle serve a legitimate purpose, the company’s own explanations undermined the claimed necessity, leading to a breach of the data minimisation principle under Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.\nThe DPA further held that the company failed to comply with the accuracy principle in Article 5(1)(d) GDPR. Despite receiving corrected information and some passport copies in advance, inaccurate birth dates remained in the travel documents. While the DPA acknowledged the partial fault of data subject by not correcting all errors in the signed contract, it emphasised that the controller had not taken all reasonable steps to ensure that the personal data it processed were accurate and up to date.\nThe DPA also found violations of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. Sending a third party’s privacy policy without clearly explaining that party’s role in the processing was considered confusing and non-transparent. In addition, the company informed an Applicant that a phone call would be recorded without providing the required information under Articles 12 and 13 GDPR and without later being able to clearly demonstrate what data processing had actually taken place.\nFinally, the DPA held that the controller had improperly fulfilled the right of access under Article 15 GDPR in relation to one data subject, as the response failed to include all personal data actually processed, such as copies of identity documents and correspondence. \nTaking into account the nature and gravity of the infringements, the DPA issued a reprimand, ordered the company to provide a complete access response, and instructed it to ensure lawful direct marketing practices."

        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nIn December 2024, the investigative television programme Report, by the national broadcaster Rai, aired a segment addressing a political controversy involving then-Minister Gennaro Sangiuliano. The controversy involved the provisional appointment of the Minister’s affair partner for a role of public relevance, then withdrawn. \nThe programme shared excerpts of a private telephone conversation between Sangiuliano and his wife requesting to withdraw the appointment, as well as references to other communications with ministry officials. The broadcast suggested that personal considerations had influenced the decision not to proceed with the appointment.\nFollowing the broadcast, the DPA initiated proceedings against Rai. In October 2025, it imposed an administrative fine of €150,000 and ordered Rai to cease further processing of the audio recording, including its storage in its archives. The DPA held that the dissemination of the private conversation exceeded what was necessary for journalistic purposes and violated data protection principles, in particular the requirement of essentiality of information.\nRai challenged the decision, arguing that the broadcast pursued a legitimate public interest and complied with the journalistic exemption under data protection law.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe court annulled the DPA’s decision, holding that the broadcast fell within the legitimate exercise of investigative journalism and respected the proper balance between privacy and freedom of information.\nFrom a privacy perspective, the court emphasised that data protection rules do not prohibit the dissemination of personal data as such, but require a contextual assessment of whether the disclosure is essential to inform the public about matters of genuine public interest. In this case, the court found that the private conversation was not used to berate the Minister’s personal life, but to demonstrate, through unmediated evidence, the concrete influence of private relationships in the institutional context. The disclosure therefore had the function of enabling the public to assess the integrity and independence of public figures.\nThe court stressed that investigative journalism in particular enjoys enhanced protection when it presents facts in their original form in order to avoid suspicion of manipulation or selective reconstruction. In circumstances where political accountability is at stake, reproducing primary material may be necessary to convey the full scope of the events. The court concluded that the excerpts broadcast by Report were strictly limited to what was indispensable, proportionate to the aim pursued, and closely connected to an issue of undeniable public relevance.\nThe judgment, additionally, briefly addressed procedural arguments, noting, without this being decisive, that the DPA’s decision had been adopted outside the applicable time limits, reinforcing the conclusion that the measure could not stand."

        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nThe applicant, Green Alliance, is an environmental association with its registered office in Bulgaria, founded in 2006. It challenged regulations under which the State Agency for National Security (the Agency) can, on the decision of its head, infiltrate “agents on cover”, civil servants who operate covertly within public authorities, private organizations, and certain professions to carry out intelligence and counterintelligence activities for national security purposes.\nThese regulations derive from the 2007 Act, which established the Agency as the successor to several national security and intelligence bodies, under government supervision, with its head appointed by the President and deputies by the government. Originally adopted in 2008, the regulations required that infiltration occur only where there was a proven operational need and, in many cases, with the consent of the target entity. They also defined the agents’ duties, prohibited the use of force or arrests, and specified employment rights.\nAmendments in 2018 expanded the scope of potential targets, removed the requirement for the target entity’s consent, and clarified that agents could operate in legal persons and civil associations, as well as in liberal professions, except private lawyers, while emphasizing that their cover must not be exposed. The Agency insisted that these agents were distinct from “agents under cover,” who may employ covert surveillance equipment, as “agents on cover” do not use technical surveillance and remain criminally liable for their acts.\nCritics, including the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee and the Supreme Bar Council, warned that these changes could violate privacy rights, professional confidentiality, and Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, given the limited judicial oversight and explicit safeguards. \nGreen Alliance argued that the regulations allowed arbitrary and disproportionate interference with its rights under Article 8 of the Convention and that the absence of effective safeguards could result in abuses. \nThe Bulgarian administrative courts held that the 2007 Act and the subsequent regulations authorizing the deployment of “agents on cover” were lawful. They found that the statutory delegation to the State Agency for National Security was valid, that the deployment of agents did not unlawfully interfere with private life or correspondence, and that sufficient oversight existed through parliamentary committees, government reporting, presidential review, and supervision by the Commission for the Protection of Personal Data. The courts concluded that the regulations struck an appropriate balance between national security needs and the protection of individual rights, and dismissed Green Alliance’s claims of violations of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\nFollowing the dismissal of its claims domestically, Green Alliance brought its application to the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe European Court of Human Rights held that the 2008 regulations on “agents on cover,” as amended in 2018, violated Article 8 of the Convention because they allowed interference with the applicant association’s rights to respect for its “home” and “correspondence” without adequate legal safeguards. The Court noted that these regulations enabled the Agency to deploy agents in private organizations and liberal professions without independent or judicial oversight, time-limits, or clear procedural requirements to ensure necessity and proportionality.\nThe regulations lacked mechanisms to supervise agents’ work effectively, and no remedies were available for entities affected by their deployment. Although agents could not use technical surveillance or claim immunity from criminal liability, they could access sensitive communications and premises, potentially interfering with the association’s Article 8 rights. Domestic remedies, including requests for personal data access or complaints to the Commission for the Protection of Personal Data, were ineffective in practice, as the Agency could refuse disclosure on national security grounds, and legal persons could not independently challenge the deployment of agents.\nThe Court emphasized that the degree of intrusion, rather than the technical method, determines the safeguards required, and found that the Bulgarian legal framework failed to prevent arbitrariness or abuse. While no evidence showed actual deployment against the applicant, the clandestine nature of “agents on cover” meant that the lack of evidence could not negate the violation. Consequently, the regulations did not meet the quality-of-law requirement under Article 8 § 2, and the Court found a breach.\nIn applying Article 41 of the Convention, the Court considered the association’s claim for just satisfaction, including €4,000 for non-pecuniary damage and €6,500 for legal proceedings. The Court underlined its discretionary power under Article 41, noting that in some cases the public vindication of a Convention breach through a binding judgment constitutes sufficient redress. Since the violation stemmed solely from the law’s existence without demonstrable harm to the association, no monetary compensation for non-pecuniary damage was necessary. \nThe Court concluded unanimously that the finding of a violation of Article 8 itself provided sufficient just satisfaction and emphasized that under Article 46, the State must take general or individual measures to remedy the violation and align domestic law with Convention standards."

(the controller) is a private company providing occupational risk prevention services. Its activities include workplace health surveillance and medical examinations for employees. The Spanish Directorate-General of Police hired the company to carry out medical examinations for members of the National Police and the Civil Guard as part of its occupational health programme. The controller conducted medical examinations at police facilities. After completing the examinations, staff transferred the paper documentation to the controller’s headquarters in Palma.\nA municipal public company in Palma informed the police that it had found a box containing medical documents abandoned on a public street. The documents related to 18 members of the National Police and Civil Guard. They contained identification data and health data. The controller had processed these data in the context of the medical examinations.\nOn 14 February 2025, the Spanish DPA (AEPD) initiated sanctioning proceedings against the controller for an alleged infringement of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR. The controller did not submit observations within the deadline. Under Article 64(2)(f) of the Spanish Law 39/2015 on the Common Administrative Procedure (Ley 39/2015 del Procedimiento Administrativo Común – LPACAP), the initiation decision therefore became a proposed decision.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe AEPD held that the controller infringed Article 5(1)(f) GDPR. Under that provision, controllers must process personal data in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorised disclosure and accidental loss.\nAEDP found that the controller had failed to ensure the confidentiality and security of the medical documentation. The exposure of health data on a public street showed that the controller had not implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures during the custody and transport of the documents. The case concerned special categories of personal data under Article 9 GDPR, which increased the seriousness of the infringement.\nWhen setting the fine, the AEPD considered the nature and gravity of the infringement, the number of affected data subjects, the negligent conduct, and the fact that the controller’s core activity involved regular processing of sensitive data. \nThe AEPD imposed an administrative fine of €100,000 under Article 83(5)(a) GDPR. In addition, they ordered the controller to implement appropriate measures within one month. The controller had to demonstrate that it ensured confidentiality and traceability in the custody, transport, delivery and storage of medical documentation processed outside its premises."

These members had jointly requested access to the association's financial statements and minutes from the past five years. The convocation notice was publicly posted on municipal notice boards and on the association's website.\nOn 16th January 2025, the DPA sent a request for information to the controller, asking it to provide details on the purposes, legal basis, and expected duration of the publications. The request was duly delivered on 22 January 2025, but the controller did not respond. As of 1st July 2025, the DPA confirmed through its own searches that the assembly minutes were still publicly available online.\nOn 4th July 2025, the DPA notified the controller of the violation of Article 157 of the Italian Data Protection Code and, regarding the underlying processing, of violations of Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(c) and 6 GDPR.\nThe controller eventually replied on 8th July 2025, arguing that the publication was necessary to ensure broad participation, particularly among elderly members without access to digital tools. It maintained that the data involved was non-sensitive and low-risk, that the members had already made their names known by signing the joint request, and that it had promptly removed the notice upon learning of the complaint.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nFirst, the DPA held that the controller publicly disclosed the names of 23 members by including them in a convocation notice posted on public notice boards and on its website. The DPA noted that this disclosure exceeded what was necessary for the purpose of convening the assembly: the controller could have referred to the existence of a joint request from a group of members (including the total number of signatories) without revealing individual identities. Since no appropriate legal basis under Article 6 GDPR was established, and the data subjects had not consented to the disclosure, the DPA found a violation of Articles 5(1)(a) and 5(1)(c) and 6 GDPR.\nSecond, the DPA found that the controller failed to respond to its request for information sent on 16th January 2025, despite it having been duly delivered. The DPA held that this constituted a violation of Article 157 of the Italian Data Protection Code, which grants the DPA the power to require controllers to provide information and documents.\nTaking into account several mitigating factors (including the absence of prior violations, the episodic nature of the breach, the fact that no special category data was involved, the non-profit and local nature of the association, and its commitment to adopting stricter measures going forward ) the DPA fined the controller €600 for the combined violations."

As a result, it opined that the data subject had already lost control over that data before the incident.\nSecond, the court found the injunction request insufficiently specific. The wording merely repeated the abstract standard of “state-of-the-art security measures” as reflected in Article 32(1) GDPR and referred to “unauthorised third parties” without concrete specification.\nThird, the court held that as the controller had responded to the access request, the claim under Article 15 GDPR had been fulfilled.\nFurthermore, the court found no substantiated non-material damage resulting from the alleged failure to appoint an EU representative or from alleged transfers outside the European Economic Area. \nFinally, the court denied compensation under Article 82(1) GDPR. It stated that a mere infringement of the GDPR did not automatically give rise to compensation. A data subject had to demonstrate actual material or non-material damage suffered. Referring to Recital 146, the court emphasised that damage must have been “suffered” and could not be purely hypothetical. It also held that the data subject had not proven a causal link between the alleged GDPR infringements and any emotional distress."

        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nOn 14 May 2025, a group of 32 members of the National Council of the Slovak Republic (the proposers) submitted a proposal to the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic challenging Act No. 109/2025 Coll. The Act, which entered into effect on 1 June 2025, required NGOs, associations, and international organisations with annual income exceeding €35,000 to submit a financial report. The report had to list all income sources and expenditures, including the country of use for funds spent outside the European Union, European Economic Area, or Switzerland. It also required identifying contributors who provided monetary or non-monetary support exceeding €5,000 per year for natural persons, and equivalent details for legal persons. The reports were to be published in the public section of the financial statements register. The law also removed previous protections guaranteeing donor anonymity under the Foundations Act and the Funds Act.\nThe proposers objected to the law on several grounds. They claimed the legislative process was unconstitutional, as debate in the National Council was limited and curtailed, preventing meaningful discussion. They argued that the law violated freedom of association by imposing detailed reporting and public disclosure obligations that could deter donors and limit NGO activities. They also contended that publishing donor names violated privacy and data protection rights under the Constitution, the Convention, and the EU Charter, and conflicted with EU rules on free movement of capital. Additionally, they requested that the Court refer a question to the Court of Justice of the European Union for a preliminary ruling.\nOn 11 August 2025, the Public Defender of Rights (the Ombudsman) also filed a motion to challenge the law. The Ombudsman emphasised that NGOs, especially those promoting human rights, perform a public watchdog function and therefore require protection from disproportionate state interference. He argued that the disclosure obligations were not necessary to prevent crime, as competent authorities already had access to relevant information. Public disclosure of donor identities and contributions could threaten personal honour, privacy, and financial autonomy, and could deter participation in civil society. The Ombudsman also highlighted that classifying NGOs as obligated entities under the Information Act blurred the distinction between private law entities and public authorities, raising concerns about the democratic and legal state.\nThe National Council justified the law as a measure to increase transparency in NGO financing, strengthen public trust, improve oversight, and prevent money laundering, corruption, and misuse of funds. It argued that disclosure obligations were limited to NGOs receiving significant funding and that existing reporting requirements were clarified rather than newly imposed. The law was also intended to align NGO reporting with obligations of public authorities and political organisations. It stressed that disclosure obligations were consistent with international standards, including OECD and MONEYVAL recommendations, and were less invasive than comparable measures in other countries.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe Court held that the Act was incompatible with Article 19(2) of the Slovak Constitution and Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. It first examined whether the law interfered with the privacy of NGO contributors, including potential impacts on personal data, reputation, and honor; then it considered the effect on NGOs’ own fundamental rights; and finally assessed the constitutional implications of extending the obligations of the Information Act—originally applicable to public entities—to NGOs.\nThe Court emphasized that privacy protects individuals from undue interference in private life, encompassing professional and social activities, autonomy, development, and relationships. Legal entities may also claim limited privacy rights, though these are narrower due to their more purposeful activities. The legislation interfered with these rights by requiring NGOs to collect and publicly disclose contributors’ names, identifying information for legal entities, and contribution amounts, depriving contributors of control over their personal information and intruding into private law relationships.\nAlthough the government cited transparency and the fight against crime, including money laundering and terrorism financing, as legitimate aims, the Court found these objectives too general to justify broad public disclosure. Transparency is primarily relevant for oversight of public power and funds, not private contributions to NGOs. There was also no evidence of a concrete or substantial risk of criminal activity necessitating disclosure, and previous law already allowed oversight with anonymization. Applying the proportionality test, the Court concluded that requiring NGOs to maintain records could be appropriate, but public disclosure was unnecessary. The legislation failed to specify the purpose, scope, or duration of data processing or to demonstrate a balance between transparency and privacy. Inconsistencies in government reasoning—asserting the need to identify contributors publicly while acknowledging many could not be identified—further rendered the law disproportionate.\nThe law similarly interfered with NGOs’ rights under Article 19(2) by restricting their informational self-determination. It imposed disclosure obligations without specific justification, making the interference disproportionate in light of the legislature’s stated objectives. Regarding freedom of association under Article 29, the Court noted that maintaining basic records does not impose an excessive burden; however, mandatory public disclosure risked deterring contributions, potentially impeding establishment, operation, or survival of associations. The law also failed to account for differences among NGOs, such as when a person holds positions in multiple organizations, creating unnecessary administrative obligations.\nThe Court assessed NGOs’ inclusion as obligated entities under the Information Act when receiving public funds. Article 26(5) of the Constitution primarily applies to public authorities or entities with public-law character; NGOs, as private-law entities, lack this character, and public-interest activities do not convert them into public authorities. The law imposed substantial administrative burdens, particularly on smaller NGOs, including responding to unfounded or partially denied requests, risking interference with core activities and potential harassment by third parties. It also discriminated against NGOs by imposing obligations not applied to other private entities receiving public funds. Public authorities already have access to such information, making the extension to NGOs unnecessary and undermining their autonomy, effectively treating them as public-law entities in violation of Article 29(4).\nThe Court further considered whether requiring NGOs to keep and publish contributor records—including donors from other EU Member States or third countries—interfered with the free movement of capital under EU law. Donations, loans, and credits fall within capital movements, and national measures restricting them, even if non-discriminatory, may constitute obstacles. Although transparency in association financing is a legitimate objective under EU law, it does not automatically justify restrictions on capital flows or interference with fundamental rights under the Charter, including privacy (Articles 7–8) and freedom of association (Article 12). As the legislation already violated the Constitution and Convention, further assessment under the Charter or referral to the Court of Justice was unnecessary, rendering EU law concerns moot.\nFinally, the Court emphasized that constitutional review ensures adherence to constitutional principles, not appeal of procedural choices. Only gross procedural violations affecting constitutional rights, particularly of parliamentary minorities, can render a law unconstitutional. Here, opposition MPs had ample opportunities to provide oral and written comments, substantial criticism was recorded, and there was no evidence of obstruction justifying shortened debate. While hasty and politically strategic, the legislative process did not violate constitutional procedural rights.\nConsequently, Act No. 109/2025 Coll. and related provisions cease to be effective."

They asserted that this publication revealed sensitive personal data, in particular political opinions, which they claimed should be protected under Article 9 GDPR.\nThe data subject maintained that despite a national legal transparency requirement (§ 6 PartG), the extent of data published went beyond what was proportionate and necessary.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe DPA processed the complaint and suspended proceedings pending a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on the applicability of the GDPR to certain parliamentary bodies (Case: C-33/22). \nFirst, the authority found that the controller had a lawful basis in national political party financing law to publish the donation information. Publication served the legitimate public interest in transparency of party financing and was not disproportionate, which falls under Article 9(2)(g) GDPR.\nSecond, the DPA considered that even if the published data could be characterised as revealing political opinions, the specific legal obligation to disclose such information justified the processing and did not infringe Article 9(1) GDPR. The controller’s statutory duty to publish detailed financial information outweighed the data subject’s confidentiality interest.\nThe DPA rejected the complaint as it held that the controller’s publication of the political donation did not constitute unlawful processing of sensitive personal data under Article 9 GDPR."

On 14 November 2022 the controller answered by again requiring the data subject to fill in the form on the website. According to the data subject, the form requested information such as their personal identification number. The controller argued that this is necessary in order to identify the data subject.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe DPA found that the controller violated Article 15(1) and Article 15(3) GDPR by failing to implement the data subject’s right of access.

Hence, the personal identity number constituted unnecessary additional information and its request violated Article 12(6) GDPR. The DPA further held that the controller infringed the data minimisation principle under Article 5(1)(c). By requiring the personal identification number as part of a routine identification practice, although it did not previously process that data and could identify the data subject based on the information already provided, the controller requested more personal data than necessary for identification.\nThe DPA found the data subject's access request by email valid and thus the controller failed to provide access to the data subject's personal data in violation of Article 15(1) and Article 15(3). The DPA issued a warning to the controller for failure to exercise the rights of the data subject and ordered the controller to comply with the data subject’s request pursuant to Article 15 GDPR."
