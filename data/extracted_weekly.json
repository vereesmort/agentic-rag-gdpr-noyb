        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nAn assistant professor (the data subject) requested access to the content of evaluation reports by independent reviewers and letters of recommendation prepared during the academic promotion procedure from the University of Cyprus (the controller).\nThe controller refused access during the ongoing promotion process, relying on their internal regulations and long-standing academic practice requiring confidentiality and anonymity of external reviewers to protect objectivity and impartiality. They indicated, however, that access could be granted after completion of the procedure, with the reviewers’ identities redacted.\nThe data subject filed a complaint with the Commissioner, the Cypriot DPA. \nThe DPA held that the controller had violated the right of access to personal data under Article 12 of Cypriot data protection law and issued a formal decision ordering the controller to ensure access, suggesting anonymization of reviewers’ names. \nThe controller then appealed that decision before the Administrative Court.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe Administrative Court annulled the DPA’s decision. It held that the DPA had failed to properly balance the data subject’s right of access under Article 15 GDPR against the legitimate interests of the controller in preserving confidentiality and procedural integrity during an ongoing promotion process. The Court emphasized that the timing of the access request was crucial and that temporary restrictions could be justified where disclosure might affect the fairness and objectivity of a complex administrative procedure.\nThe Court further found that the DPA had focused too narrowly on anonymization and had not adequately considered whether deferring access until the conclusion of the promotion process would constitute a proportionate limitation of the right of access. The controller’s position was not to deny access permanently, rather, it indicated that access could be provided after the final decision, with reviewers’ names redacted."

He then sent 41 emails containing 848 documents that included the insurance policies and personal data (names, addresses, personal identification numbers, birth dates, and phone numbers) of at least 334 clients. He first sent the data to his official work email and then forwarded it to his private email. \nThe prosecution alleged that this conduct violated the GDPR, the Croatian GDPR Implementation Act, and internal company access rules and this this constituted unauthorized use of personal data and unauthorized access to computer systems under Croatian criminal law.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe court held that the defendant committed a criminal offense against privacy. Because the defendant intentionally accessed and used personal data without permission and without a valid legal basis under Article 6(1) GDPR, the court held that he committed the criminal offense of violation of privacy under Article 146(1) of the Croatian Criminal Code. The court sentenced HIM to a prison term of three months.\nAdditionally, the court found that the defendant knowingly accessed the employer’s computer systems without authorisation. The court held that this conduct constituted a criminal offense against computer systems, programs, and data under Article 266(1) of the Croatian Criminal Code because it involved intentional interference with computer systems which the defendant had no lawful access. For this the court sentenced the defendant to a prison term of four months.\nThe court combined the sentences into a single six-month prison term. It then imposed a suspended sentence, so the prison term would not be executed if the defendant did not commit another crime within a one-year probation period. The court explained that it could revoke the suspended sentence if the defendant committed another offense that resulted in imprisonment. The court also ordered him to pay €30 in procedural costs. It held that this sanction was sufficient to prevent future violations and to fulfill the aims of punishment under Croatian law."

The complainant then appealed to the Federal Administrative Court.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe Court dismissed the appeal, holding that there was no violation of the GDPR because the data subject had not submitted a formal request for rectification. Article 16 GDPR requires a clear and specific request for correction, and vague or indirect statements, such as tweets or general demands for a change of the controller’s practice, do not satisfy this requirement.\nDuring the proceedings, it became clear that the data subject’s statements, primarily concerned the implementation of a future change of the controller’s practice to allow a gender-neutral option for all users, rather than a concrete request to correct their own personal data. In addition, some corrections had already been made to the data subject’s profile and invoices, while oral misgendering in trains and via loudspeaker announcements was found to fall outside the scope of the GDPR, as such statements were not stored in any personal data filing system.\nFinally, the Court noted that the minutes of the Equal Treatment Commission hearing could not be relied upon as full proof, as the hearing had been recorded only in audio form and not documented in accordance with the requirements of Austrian administrative procedure law (AVG). Statements made during the Equal Treatment Commission proceedings therefore did not constitute a formal exercise of the right to rectification under Article 16 GDPR."

This software enabled users (data subjects) to upload their files and track their progress via an online portal. \nOn 2 November and 10 November 2022, data subjects using the portal reported to the controller that they had access to files relating to other data subjects.  \nOn 22 November 2022, the controller notified the data breach to the DPA. The breach was found to be due to a configuration mistake, made by the processor. \nAfter an on-site inspection, the DPA opened an investigation.  \n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe dispute related to the processor’s responsibility for implementing adequate security measures, under Article 32 GDPR. \nOn the fairness of the procedure: \nAt first, the DPA rejected the argument based on a violation of Article 6 ECHR. The DPA pointed out that the right not to incriminate oneself is not incompatible with the sharing of the complainant’s internal reports, even under coercive measures. What’s more, the disclosed reports are evidence on which the DPA can base its argument. \nAbout responsibilities: \nThe DPA jointly appreciated article 4(8) GDPR, article 28 (3)(a) GDPR and article 32 GDPR. The DPA noted that the contract binding the processor and the controller, as well as the processor’s expertise as a software consulting company, show that the processor was responsible for ensuring data security.\nAs a result, the processor was also responsible for its sub-processors compliance to GDPR, especially when they introduced a block of computer code on the software’s code.\nOn the violation of article 32 GDPR: \nThe DPA recalled that the definition of security measures must take into account the state of art, the cost of such measures, but also the risks of the processing and the category of personal data processed. The rapporteur noted that the personal data processed were sensitive data, and that the security measures must be adapted to such circumstances. \nTo evaluate the measures taken, the DPA referred to a principle of the National Agency for Information Systems Security (French ANSSI). The principle is that the security of an information system must be based on a coherent whole, rather than on specific security points, so that, in theory, the whole does not depend on a few security points. With this principle, the information system is supposed to balance the failure of one of its security points. \nHere, the DPA highlighted that the software was processing a large amount of personal data, even sensitive data, with a high risk for data subjects in case of a violation, due to the aggregation of extremely precise and various data (health related, national identifier, financial status, identification data). \nThe processor was aware of critical and significant vulnerabilities, thanks to reports he commissioned. In addition, an internal report had identified the weakness of the information system security, particularly the use of an obsolete encryption system. \nHowever, the processor has not taken any measures to remedy the situation before a breach occurred. \nThe DPA considered that the processor had not taken sufficient measures to ensure the security of the personal data processed, and so violated article 32 GDPR. \nA fine of €1,700,000 is imposed to the processor."

However, it failed to do so, arguing that the data subject had not specified their relationship with the company (former or prospective client), which allegedly prevented timely handling of the requests.\nThe controller further claimed that it had a valid consent for marketing in both cases, obtained in different ways. For the former client, Verisure relied on consent provided at the time of contract signature, where the privacy policy was attached. For the prospective client, Verisure argued that consent was given during an online request for a price estimate through a form on the website, where the data subject was required to provide a phone number to receive the estimate and was informed that by clicking “yes” they accepted the linked privacy policy.\nWith regard to data retention, Verisure applied a 12-month retention period for prospective clients’ data, while for former clients no concrete retention period was defined, using only generic wording such as “as long as necessary.”\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe DPA upheld the complaints and imposed an administrative fine of €400,000.\nFirst, the DPA found that consent was not a valid legal basis for marketing communications directed at prospective clients. Because the provision of a phone number was required to obtain a price estimate, the consent was not freely given within the meaning of Article 7 GDPR. The DPA also found that the conditions for valid consent under Articles 7(2) and 7(4) GDPR were not met.\nSecond, the DPA held that Verisure had failed to provide adequate information to both former and prospective clients regarding the processing of personal data for marketing purposes, in breach of Article 13 GDPR.\nThird, the DPA identified serious deficiencies in Verisure’s data retention practices. The 12-month retention period for prospective clients was deemed excessive for the sole purpose of providing a price estimate, while the absence of any defined retention period for former clients violated the principle of storage limitation. As a result, the DPA found infringements of Article 5(1)(e) GDPR, as well as Article 13(2)(a) GDPR for failure to properly inform data subjects about retention periods.\nFinally, the DPA found that Verisure responded late to the data subjects’ requests to object to the processing and to have their data erased, in violation of Articles 12(3), 17, and 21 GDPR. The DPA emphasised that controllers must be able to handle data subject rights requests promptly and cannot shift the burden onto data subjects by requiring them to clarify their status when they have access to it in their records.\nThe cumulative infringements relating to unlawful marketing, invalid consent, excessive retention, lack of transparency, and delayed responses justified the imposition of a €400,000 fine."

The controller further contended that the data subject could have deleted the cookies from his device at any time.\nThe Court rejected these arguments and granted an injunction and awarded damages of €1,500 to the data subject.

The lawfulness of processing depends on the existence of valid prior consent, not on the data subject’s ability to mitigate the effects of unlawful processing after the fact.\nThe Court further clarified that the burden of proof for demonstrating valid consent rests with the controller. Accordingly, the controller’s argument that the data subject had failed to show that he did not consent was dismissed as irrelevant.\nWith regard to damages, the court found that the infringement did not result in a significant loss of control over personal data, as the data subject was aware of the processing and the personal data at issue (IP address and cookie ID) were not particularly sensitive. Nevertheless, the court held that the storage and processing of cookies for advertising purposes without consent gave rise to a feeling of being monitored, which amounted to non-material damage.\nGiven that the impairment suffered by the data subject was minor, the Court considered an award of €100 in non-material damages under Article 82 GDPR to be appropriate."

The data subject had maintained a user account since 2008 and had provided personal data, including a telephone number. At the relevant time, the controller’s default settings allowed user profiles to be searchable by telephone number by all other users via a contact import function.\nBy exploiting this function, unknown third parties were able to link telephone numbers to user profiles and extract large volumes of data. In 2021, data relating to approximately 533 million users worldwide, including the data subject’s telephone number linked with publicly visible profile data (such as name, gender, and user ID), was published online.\nThe data subject brought an action before the Regional Court of Braunschweig seeking non-material damages, injunctive relief, declaratory relief concerning future damages, and reimbursement of legal fees. The Regional Court dismissed the action in full. The data subject appealed.\nThe controller argued that the processing was lawful, in particular because the data were publicly visible or based on contractual necessity, and that the data subject had not suffered any compensable non-material damage. It further stated that the data subject had not demonstrated a loss of control over personal data.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe Court partially upheld the appeal and awarded the data subject €100 in non-material damages.\nThe Court held that the controller violated the GDPR by making user profiles searchable by telephone number by default. This default setting breached the principles of data minimisation and data protection by default under Articles 5(1)(c) and 25(2) GDPR. The processing was not necessary for the performance of the user contract under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, and the controller failed to demonstrate valid consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. In particular, opt-out mechanisms and inactivity by the data subject could not constitute consent, and the burden of proof for valid consent rested with the controller.\nThe Court further found that the controller could not evade responsibility by invoking a lack of knowledge about the scraping incident. As controller, it bore the accountability obligation under Article 5(2) GDPR and could not rely on ignorance resulting from inadequate documentation.\nWith regard to damages, the Court clarified that a temporary or minor loss of control over personal data may constitute non-material damage within the meaning of Article 82 GDPR, even in the absence of additional tangible negative consequences. The unauthorised linking and subsequent public dissemination of the data subject’s telephone number with other profile data resulted in a loss of control over personal data.\nHowever, the Court considered the impairment suffered by the data subject to be minor. The data concerned were not particularly sensitive, and no significant further consequences were established. Taking this into account, the Court considered an award of €100 in non-material damages to be appropriate."

The survey was aimed at the residents of a real estate cooperative and was to be compiled on a voluntary basis.\nAmong other questions, residents were asked whether they were blood donors and how they voted in both local and national elections. About ten residents (the data subjects) filled the survey. The data subjects did not provide their name even though the survey asked them to. The data subjects were not provided with a privacy notice.\nThe survey was administered via a Google Form on the researcher's personal Google account. Therefore, the data were available to her alone and were outside the control of the University.\nAn association later filed a report with the DPA, claiming that the data were collected without a legal basis and without providing sufficient information about the processing.\nAt the request of the University, the researcher later erased all the data.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nOn controllership[edit | edit source]\nThe DPA first examined the roles of the University and the researcher.\nThe researcher who created the form was the recipient of a research grant from the University of Turin and was carrying out her research under the supervision of one of the University’s professors. The University believed that the survey, and the research project as a whole, would not collect personal data. Therefore, the University did not instruct the researcher or the professor on how to process the data.\nThe DPA held that the survey processed personal data, including sensitive data. In the context of this processing, the DPA held that the University was the controller and that both the professor and researcher processed data under the controller’s authority (Article 29 GDPR).\n\nThe violations[edit | edit source]\nThe DPA found that the controller did not provide the data subjects with a privacy notice. In particular, the controller did not clarify to the data subjects which legal basis it relied upon for processing their data, and which exemption under Article 9(2) GDPR it relied upon for processing their sensitive data.\nThe DPA held that the controller violated:\n\nThe principle of lawfulness (art. 5(1)(a) GDPR), by processing personal data without a legal basis;\nArticle 9 GDPR, by processing sensitive data with no exemption under Article 9(2);\nArticles 12 and 13 GDPR, by failing to provide the data subjects with sufficient information about the processing of their data;\nIts responsibilities as a controller (Article 24 GDPR);\nThe principle of data protection by design and default (Article 25 GDPR);\nArticle 29 GDPR, by failing to instruct the researcher on how to process personal data.\nArticle 32 GDPR, by collecting the data via a platform outside of its control and by storing them within the researcher’s private account.\nThe DPA considered the incident a minor violation and issued a warning. Among other factors, the DPA considered that the violation was not voluntary and that the controller erased the data as soon as the investigation started."

As the controller has no main EU establishment, the “one-stop-shop” mechanism under Articles 56 and 60 GDPR does not apply, making the HDPA competent under Articles 2(1), 3(2), and 55(1) GDPR. \nThe HDPA also held that while not a public figure, the data subject’s professional activity places them in a role of public interest, as executives of significant companies may attract public interest."

She claimed that in 2019 her image appeared on the billboard for approximately three months without her consent. She sent three letters requesting the removal of the image and compensation. While the controller removed the image, it refused to pay compensation. \nThe data subject relied on Article 82 GDPR, Articles 23 and 24 of the Civil Code (Kodeks cywilny) and Article 81 of the Act of 4 February 1994 on Copyright and Related Rights (Ustawa o prawie autorskim i prawach pokrewnych), arguing that her personal rights were infringed and that her former employment did not constitute consent. She also stated that the image appeared on the defendant’s Facebook profile from 29 September 2017 to 23 November 2020 without her consent.\nThe controller argued that it was not liable because it had commissioned an external company to produce the advertisement. It claimed that the data subjects had given verbal consent to participate in a professional photo, and that her image appeared only as a minor background detail, which did not require consent under Article 81(2)(2) of the Act on Copyright and Related Rights. The controller also stated that the data subject could not be identified from the billboard and that any liability for infringement rested with the advertising company.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe court held that the data subject did not consent to the use of her image for advertising purposes. It established that she participated in the photoshoot under instructions from her supervisor, believing only her hands would appear, and that no explicit consent was given for the publication of her face. \nThe court argued that the controller made the decision to publish the image and is therefore fully responsible, regardless of the involvement of the external marketing agency. It further established that the image clearly identified the data subject and that its use violated her personal rights and privacy under Polish civil law and GDPR.\nThe court awarded the damages based on Polish civil law and Article 82 GDPR: The court noted that, under Article 82 GDPR, a data subject who suffers damage as a result of unlawful processing has the right to obtain compensation from the controller or processor. \nThe court concluded that the data subject suffered non-material damage and awarded her PLN30,000 (€6,500) in compensation."

        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nA data subject underwent an MRI at a hospital (the controller) on 18 November 2021. They brought several CDs containing earlier MRI scans from 2018, 2019 and 2020, so that the controller’s medical staff could compare these images with the new examination. The hospital’s internal documentation confirmed that the data subject delivered these CDs.\nOn 29 March 2022, the data subject returned to the hospital to collect the CDs. The controller informed them that the CDs could not be found. On 4 April 2022, the controller explained by email that the hospital had limited physical storage capacity and that uncollected physical material was periodically removed. The controller stated that the CDs provided by the data subject were no longer available.\nThe controller later described its internal procedures. It stated that patients had to collect physical test results within one month and that the hospital used a collection sheet to inform them about this rule. According to the controller, any uncollected physical material was sent to a central archive or destroyed after one month. \nIn January 2024, the data subject asked the hospital to return the CDs again. On 23 January 2024, the controller replied that the images had been unregistered long ago and emphasised the one-month collection rule. On 19 January 2024, the data subject submitted a complaint to the Spanish DPA (AEPD) alleging that the controller had lost the CDs.\nThe AEPD sought information from the controller and opened formal proceedings on 22 November 2024. In its opening decision, the AEPD stated that the facts could amount to infringements of Article 9 GDPR, Article 6 GDPR and Article 25 GDPR. On 16 July 2025, the AEPD issued a proposed decision suggesting fines of €100,000 for Article 9, €100,000 for Article 6 and €1,000,000 for Article 25.\nThe controller contested the proposal. It argued that the AEPD incorrectly reassessed medical criteria by suggesting that the CDs should have been added to the medical record. According to the controller, only the treating physician could decide what belonged in that record under domestic health legislation. The controller insisted that the CDs were not medical documentation produced by the hospital and therefore were not subject to retention duties under national health law. It repeated that storing the CDs beyond their immediate diagnostic use would have violated the principle of data minimisation. The controller also stated that it had appropriate internal procedures for handling external material and that the alleged infringements were unfounded or time-barred.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe AEPD held that the controller had infringed Articles 9, 6, and 25 GDPR. It found that the controller unlawfully destroyed the data subject’s health data, acted without a valid legal basis, and failed to implement data protection by design and by default.\nRegarding Article 9 GDPR, the AEPD found a violation because the controller erased the data subject’s MRI data without any applicable Article 9(2) exception and before the retention period required by health law. The CDs formed part of the patient’s clinical documentation, yet when the patient returned to collect them, the hospital had already removed or “unregistered” them.\nAdditionally, the AEPD found a breach of Article 6 GDPR because the hospital deleted the patient’s MRI data without any lawful basis. The hospital removed the CDs after one month under its own archive-cleaning practice, even though health law required longer retention, and it could not demonstrate any Article 6(1) ground permitting such deletion.\nFurthermore, the AEPD found a breach of Article 25 GDPR because the hospital lacked any procedure to manage patient-provided clinical data and had not implemented data protection by design and by default. Although it had rules for imaging and data-subject rights, it had no system governing the storage, retention, or return of physical media containing health data, which resulted in the loss of the patient’s CD. Since these safeguards should have been integrated from the outset and the hospital only created a procedure after the investigation began, the AEPD held that this structural failure constituted an infringement of Article 25 GDPR.\nMoreover, the AEPD rejected arguments that it misinterpreted data protection obligations or that patient-provided clinical documentation was exempt from retention requirements, emphasising that healthcare centres must preserve all clinical data in their possession, regardless of format.\nConsequently, the AEPD imposed fines of €100,000 for Article 9, €100,000 for Article 6, and €1,000,000 for Article 25, totalling €1,200,000."

        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nA companion of a member asked the HDPA how to object to biometric processing at a private nautical club, which triggered the HDPA’s investigation. On 6 April 2022, members were told access would henceforth be possible only via a new facial-recognition system, and the existing RFID card system would be disabled. The club asserted multiple Article 6 bases and Article 9 exceptions, circulated vendor assurances about encryption and non-reconstructability, and claimed the system did not process “sensitive” data, while also communicating that refusal could jeopardise membership. After objections, the club amended its internal rules to state that, upon withdrawal of consent, members could use a card, yet communications simultaneously suggested the card system had been discontinued and refusal could affect membership. The HDPA convened a hearing to assess alleged infringements including the lack of a DPIA and concerns over DPO independence.  The biometric system processed special category data through facial recognition for roughly 3,500 data subjects (members and companions), indicating large-scale processing with heightened risk.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe HDPA confirmed that facial-recognition data are biometric data under Article 4 (14) and thus special category data under Article 9(1), requiring strict compliance with the principles of lawfulness, necessity, proportionality, and data minimisation. The controller failed to demonstrate necessity and proportionality, as less intrusive access-control methods were reasonably available, so the processing violated Article 5(1)(a) and the assessment of Article 6 and Article 9 bases was unnecessary once unlawfulness was established.  The HDPA emphasised that consent cannot cure non-compliance with other controller obligations, and does not validate processing that breaches core principles.  Given the large-scale special category processing using innovative technology and the potential high risk, a DPIA was required but not properly conducted.  The HDPA ordered the controller to carry out a DPIA and to suspend biometric processing until completion, and imposed administrative fines totalling €56,000: €28,000 for unlawfulness under Article 5(1)(a), €14,000 for failing to conduct a DPIA (Article 35), and €14,000 for violating DPO independence (Article 38(3))."

The data subject asked the controller to provide him with a copy of the recorded conversations he had with the controller's employees, as well as to inform him of any personal data concerning him that are being processed and kept in the controller’s record. \nThe data subject claimed that the controller did not satisfy any of the requests appropriately, as he was asked to receive the copies in person from the controller’s offices, even though he had notified that he was living abroad, and the controller’s response regarding which personal data were being processed was not concrete and full. \nIn its defense, the controller claimed that it had sent a letter to the data subject’s registered postal address, stating which recorded conversations are kept in its records, and inviting him to receive them in person. Within the controller’s policy, there was an exception for those residing abroad, enabling them to obtain copies of the recorded conversations via courier or, exceptionally, via e-mail after a phone call with the controller’s representatives.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nFirst, the DPA found that the controller did not, in a timely manner, inform the data subject of all his personal data that were being processed, thereby violating Article 15(1) GDPR in conjunction with Article 12(3) GDPR. Taking into account Article 58(2)(i) and Article 82 GDPR, the DPA imposed a €1,000 fine on the controller. \nSecond, the DPA imposed an additional fine of €2,000 on the controller because it held that the latter provided copies of the recorded conversations to the data subject past due, and only after the examination procedure before the Authority, which constituted a violation of Article 15(1) GDPR, together with Article 12(2) GDPR and Article 12(3) GDPR. \nFinally, the DPA held that the controller’s current terms of access to recorded conversations violated Article 12(2) GDPR and ordered the controller to change its policy within 30 days of notification of the present decision to facilitate access to such recordings in the simplest possible way, as a rule, not an exception."
