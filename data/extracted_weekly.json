The municipalities acted as controllers, while Google Cloud EMEA Limited (Ireland) acted as the primary data processor and Google relied on a complex chain of sub-processors. \n\nBackground[edit | edit source]\nGiven the sensitivity of the processing and the complexity of the processing chain, the Danish Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet) initiated an extensive supervisory investigation known as the “Chromebook Case Complex.” This decision forms part of that investigation and concerns the use of Google software in schools, focusing on whether the data controllers adequately understood and fulfilled their responsibilities when engaging Google as a processor, including identifying the relevant sub-processors and ensuring their compliance with applicable data protection rules.\nIn July 2024, Datatilsynet informed KL (Kommunernes Landsforening), the national association of municipalities, acting as representative for the controllers, that it would seek an opinion from the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) on the obligations of data controllers when using processors and sub-processors, particularly regarding documentation of processing structures. \nThe EDPB opinion of October 2024 clarified that controllers must maintain a complete and documented overview of all processors and sub-processors, their roles, locations, and compliance with GDPR requirements, including rules on international data transfers.\n\nInformation requests and documentation submitted by KL.[edit | edit source]\nBetween January and June 2025, Datatilsynet repeatedly requested KL to submit documentation on behalf of the controllers, including lists of all processors and sub-processors, descriptions of their processing activities, their geographical locations, and evidence of the controllers’ assessments of legality and compliance. KL submitted preliminary and supplementary responses explaining that Google Cloud EMEA Limited was the main processor, that third-party sub-processors including both Google Group entities and third-party providers, located within the EU/EEA and in several third countries, including the United States, India, Mexico, Taiwan, Australia, Canada, Singapore, Brazil, Hong Kong, and Japan. KL further described technical and organisational measures such as “Data Regions EU”, limiting certain processing to the EU/EEA, and “Access Approvals”, restricting sub-processor access to personal data.\n\nFocus on sub-processors outside the EU/EEA[edit | edit source]\nAs the final step of its supervision, and following the EDPB opinion, Datatilsynet specifically focused on the use of sub-processors located outside the EU/EEA. The Authority examined whether the controllers had adequately assessed and documented the legal basis for the processing carried out by those sub-processors, including whether onward transfers ensured a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed in the EU/EEA, in light of the Schrems II judgment and the four European essential guarantees.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nDatatilsynet concluded that the controllers failed to fully comply with GDPR requirements. \nWhile the data processing agreement with Google documented the obligations of Google and its sub-processors, the controllers did not demonstrate that they had verified or would verify that sub-processors adhered to these obligations, particularly regarding onward transfers to third countries. The Datatilsynet emphasized that third-country transfers require an assessment of whether the four European essential guarantees are effectively ensured, and that contractual obligations alone do not suffice for unsafe countries such as India, Mexico, Taiwan, and others. \nDatatilsynet held that the controllers’ processing of personal data did not meet the requirements of Article 5(2) GDPR, 5(1)(a) GDPR and (f) GDPR, 24 GDPR, and 28(1) GDPR and (4) GDPR. \nOn this basis, the Datatilsynet expressed serious criticism of the 51 controllers and warned them that their practices likely violate Article 6(1) GDPR and Article 28(1) GDPR if the controllers had not configured Google’s services according to the conditional and functional requirements specified by KL, including restrictions on the transfer of personal data to sub-processors in third countries lacking an essentially equivalent level of protection."

He filed a complaint with the DPA, arguing that the controller unlawfully retained his personal data, failed to properly respond to his access request, ignored his request not to be contacted, and processed cookies on its website without providing information or obtaining consent.\nThe controller explained that the data subject had registered for a visit in 2013 but never attended, and that only his name, surname, and telephone number were stored. The reminder messages were sent by mistake due to a human error in selecting a patient with the same name. The controller deleted the data upon request and stated that long-term storage resulted from a technical limitation of the registration system. It also acknowledged deficiencies in cookie consent mechanisms on its website.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe DPA held that the reminder SMS messages were not sent for direct marketing purposes and therefore did not breach the purpose limitation principle contained in Article 5(1)(b) GDPR. The complaint concerning transparency at the time of data collection in 2013 was dismissed due to the statute of limitations.\nHowever, the DPA found that the controller violated the principle of storage limitation by retaining the data subject’s personal data for more than ten years after an uncompleted registration. It also held that the controller failed to fully comply with the data subject’s right of access by not providing information on data recipients and storage periods. Thus, the DPA has found violations of Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(e), Article 13, and Article 15 GDPR. \nIn addition, the DPA found that the controller processed non-essential cookies without valid consent and failed to provide clear and accurate information about cookie use. The controller was ordered to implement corrective measures regarding cookie consent and transparency and was issued a formal reprimand for the identified violations."

        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nThe data subject, an employee of a public hospital, lodged a complaint alleging that a technical expert report prepared in the context of ongoing litigation with his employer had been circulated internally within the workplace. The document contained personal data relating to the employment dispute as well as detailed information concerning the data subject’s health, including a list of specialist medical examinations.\nThe controller sent the document via certified email (PEC) to several internal units, including public relations, medical-legal services, and human resources, using shared email inboxes accessible to multiple employees with different roles and responsibilities. As a result, numerous staff members who were not directly involved in the litigation and did not require access to the information were able to view the document.\nThe controller argued that the internal circulation was necessary for handling the litigation, that staff members were bound by confidentiality obligations, and that there was no evidence that unauthorised employees had actually opened or read the document. Moreover, it was argued that due to understaffing and limited resources, many employees covered multiple tasks outside of their primary ones.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe DPA found that the controller had unlawfully communicated personal data, including health data, to internal recipients who were not authorised to process such information for their specific job functions.\nIt held that, even within an employment relationship and in the context of public-sector tasks, the processing and internal communication of personal data must be strictly limited to what is necessary and proportionate. The use of shared email inboxes accessible to staff with heterogeneous roles violated the principles of lawfulness, data minimisation, and data protection by design and by default under Articles 5 and 25 GDPR.\nThe DPA rejected the controller’s argument that confidentiality duties and organisational constraints justified the broad circulation of the document. It stressed that the absence of proof that unauthorised staff actually accessed the document was irrelevant, as the unlawful disclosure consisted in making the data accessible.\nThe controller was found to have infringed Articles 5(1)(a) and (c), 6, and 9(2)(b) GDPR, as well as the relevant national provisions, and was ordered to pay an administrative fine of €6,000."

        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nThe data subject was subject to a home visit by the public health authority following an external report raising concerns about her condition. After the visit, the authority created internal medical notes and administrative records documenting observations made by a physician, as well as information about the person who had reported the situation.\nThe data subject subsequently requested access under Article 15 GDPR to all records held about her, including call logs, internal reports, medical notes, and any documents containing her name. The authority provided a GDPR response and later disclosed the entire file, but redacted personal data relating to authority staff and the reporting third party.\nThe data subject brought an action seeking full, unredacted disclosure, arguing that the records did not accurately reflect what had occurred during the home visit and that she was entitled to receive the documents in their entirety under the GDPR.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe court dismissed the claim, holding that the controller had fully complied with its obligations under Article 15 GDPR. It emphasised that the right of access and the right to obtain a copy under Article 15(3) GDPR concern only the data subject’s own personal data, not the documents or files as such in which those data appear.\nRelying expressly on the CJEU’s judgment in C-487/21 (CRIF), the court recalled that the concept of a “copy” under Article 15(3) GDPR refers to a faithful reproduction of the personal data undergoing processing, not necessarily to a copy of the entire document containing them. The decisive criterion is whether the information provided enables the data subject to obtain a complete and accurate understanding of the personal data processed about them and to effectively exercise their GDPR rights, such as rectification, erasure, or restriction of processing.\nThe court further clarified, in line with the CJEU’s reasoning, that the controller is entitled to redact information in the same document that does not relate to the data subject, including personal data of third parties. Such redactions are lawful provided that they do not distort or render unintelligible the data subject’s own personal data or the context in which those data are processed. The court thus found that the redactions made by the authority were permissible and did not undermine the substance of the access right, as the disclosed records still allowed the data subject to understand the purpose, context, and use of her personal data.\nFinally, the court stressed that Article 15 GDPR does not provide a mechanism to contest the factual accuracy or substantive correctness of administrative or medical assessments. Disagreements about the content of reports must be pursued through other legal remedies and cannot be resolved through the GDPR right of access."

The controller responded that she was not registered as a “trusted person”, and the deceased had designated another trusted person, who alone had access to the medical records.\nThe data subject filed a complaint with the Austrian Data Protection Authority (DSB), alleging a violation of her right of access under Article 15 GDPR, arguing that the hospital failed to respond properly to her requests.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe DSB dismissed the complaint as unfounded. It held that the data subject’s emails did not constitute a valid access request under Article 15 GDPR, as they merely sought disclosure of a specific piece of information (the medical cause of death) rather than information about the processing of personal data. Consequently, no obligation to respond under Article 12(3) GDPR arose. \nThe DSB further found that the requested information did not relate to the data subject’s own personal data but to that of her deceased father. Since the GDPR does not apply to personal data of deceased persons under Recital 27 and the right of access is a strictly personal and non-transferable right, the complainant could not rely on Article 15 GDPR to obtain the information. The absence of a valid access request was not a procedural defect capable of being cured, and the complaint therefore had to be rejected."

        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nThe Minister of Justice lodged a complaint with the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) against Resolution No. […] of 3 December 2022 adopted by the National Council of Legal Counsels (Krajowa Rada Radców Prawnych – KRRP). The resolution introduced Regulations for the exercise of the profession of legal counsel.\nAfter receiving a negative opinion from the Minister, the KRRP amended parts of the Regulations but maintained § 5 and § 6, which remained contested.\n§ 5 of the Regulations required legal counsels to ensure that persons cooperating with them in providing legal assistance commit in writing to maintain professional secrecy. § 6 required legal counsels to keep a register of clients for the purpose of identifying conflicts of interest. The register could be shared with other legal counsels practising together.\nThe Minister argued that § 6 required the processing of client personal data without a valid legal basis under Article 6 GDPR. In particular, the Minister claimed that no statutory provision required legal counsels to keep a client register and that such processing was not necessary under Article 6(1)(b), Article 6(1)(d), or Article 6(1)(e). The Minister also argued that reliance on consent under Article 6(1)(a) would contradict the structure of the free legal aid system, which aims to protect the anonymity of beneficiaries.\nAccording to the Minister, § 6 interfered with the statutory framework of the free legal aid system established under the Act of 15 August 2015 on Free Legal Assistance, Free Civic Counselling and Legal Education. The Minister argued that the creation of a client register could undermine public trust and introduce additional formalities not provided for by statute.\nRegarding § 5, the Minister argued that the provision could be interpreted as requiring confidentiality declarations from coordinators or other persons organising free legal aid. In the Minister’s view, this would interfere with the statutory structure of the system.\nThe KRRP requested dismissal of the complaint. It argued that beneficiaries of free legal aid are clients in the same way as private clients. The relationship between a legal counsel and a client is not anonymous and is always subject to professional secrecy and conflict-of-interest rules.\nThe KRRP further argued that § 6 did not create a new obligation to process personal data. Legal counsels, acting as controllers, are already required under Article 15 of the Act of 6 July 1982 on Legal Counsels (Ustawa o radcach prawnych – u.r.p.) to avoid conflicts of interest. The client register merely provided a method for fulfilling this statutory duty. Therefore, processing was lawful under Article 6(1)(c) because it was necessary to comply with a legal obligation.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe Supreme Court dismissed the complaint and maintained the contested resolution in force.\nThe Court held that clients receiving free legal aid cannot be treated differently from privately paying clients. Legal counsels must ensure the same standards of confidentiality and conflict-of-interest protection regardless of the source of funding.\nThe central issue was whether § 6 created a new obligation to process personal data requiring an independent legal basis under Article 6 GDPR. The Court held that it did not. Article 15 u.r.p. already requires legal counsels to avoid conflicts of interest and to refuse representation where such conflicts exist. § 6 only specified the method for fulfilling that obligation.\nThe Court found that processing client personal data for the purpose of verifying conflicts of interest was lawful under Article 6(1)(c). Two conditions were fulfilled: a statutory provision imposed a legal obligation on the controller, and processing was necessary to comply with that obligation. The statutory basis was Article 15 u.r.p. The Regulation did not create a new legal ground but clarified the implementation of an existing duty.\nThe Court further held that preventing conflicts of interest serves the public interest, including the protection of the right to a fair trial and legal certainty. The introduction of a client register was proportionate to that objective.\nRegarding § 5, the Court held that coordinators of the free legal aid system do not qualify as persons cooperating in the provision of legal assistance within the meaning of the Regulation. Therefore, legal counsels were not required to obtain confidentiality declarations from them.\nFor these reasons, the Supreme Court upheld the resolution in its entirety."

The data subject lodged a complaint with the Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP) on 24 July 2021.\nFollowing the complaint, the controller removed some of the personal data, making the infringement of privacy minor. The AP concluded that there was no violation of the GDPR and emphasized that the controller had discretion under Article 5(1) of the Woo (Wet open overheid) to disclose information contained in public documents.\nThe data subject appealed the AP's decision on both procedural and substantive grounds. While the initial claim concerned the AP’s failure to decide on time, he also raised legal arguments, including that the authority had not investigated sufficiently, that the publication of address data violated the GDPR, and that the AP should have conducted an independent GDPR assessment separate from the Woo framework.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe appeal was found manifestly inadmissible, and the court issued its judgment without a hearing.\nThe court pointed out that the matter at hand had already been decided in a previous judgment (ECLI:NL:RBMNE:2023:6538). That case, decided under the Woo, had already balanced privacy interests against the public interest in transparency, concluding that disclosure of the address data was lawful.\nIn the present case, the court declined to re-examine the issue because the data subject requested the same balancing to be repeated under the GDPR, without introducing any new facts or legal grounds. As the Woo is recognised as applicable national law under Article 86 GDPR, the previous assessment sufficed. The AP was therefore entitled to rely on the prior Woo-based judgments, and no separate GDPR investigation was required.\nThe court ordered the AP to pay the €437,50 procedural costs because the AP had issued the decision too late."

The request was made through Vodafone’s internal telephone support channel for retail stores. The caller impersonated staff and provided several data elements, including the store user code, the data subject’s identification number (NIE), the mobile phone number and digits of the ICC number of the new SIM card.\nVodafone processed the request and activated the duplicate SIM card. On the same day, the data subject’s phone stopped working. Shortly afterwards, four unauthorised transactions totalling €1,996 were carried out from their bank account.\nThe data subject contacted Vodafone, their bank and the police. Vodafone confirmed that a duplicate SIM card had been issued through a physical point of sale. After the data subject presented a complaint, during the investigation, Vodafone explained that its internal policy required store staff to call a dedicated support channel and provide identifying information before a duplicate SIM could be issued. Vodafone stated that the fraudster had provided the required information and that the security protocol in force at the time had been followed. The controller also informed the AEPD that it later adopted additional measures to reinforce the security of the duplicate SIM procedure.\nOn the basis of these facts, the AEPD opened sanctioning proceedings against Vodafone for an alleged infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe AEPD found that Vodafone infringed Article 6(1) GDPR by processing the personal data of the data subject without a valid legal basis.\nThe AEPD held that the issuance and activation of a duplicate SIM card involved the processing of personal data. Vodafone carried out this processing without the knowledge or consent of the data subject and without any other legal basis under Article 6(1) GDPR. As a result, the processing was unlawful.\nThe AEPD rejected the controller’s argument that it had complied with its internal security protocols. The DPA stated that the existence of internal procedures did not remove the obligation to ensure that processing had a valid legal basis. The intervention of a criminal third party did not exempt the controller from responsibility where the unlawful processing occurred within its own systems and procedures.\nThe AEPD considered that Vodafone acted at least negligently. It took into account the nature of the infringement and the link between the processing and the controller’s core business activity. The DPA imposed an administrative fine of €150,000 on Vodafone for the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR."

On 8 February 2024, the data subject received the letter at their workplace and signed the proof of delivery. The document included the data subject’s name, national identification number and signature.\nOn 16 March 2024, VOX published an image of that proof of delivery on its Facebook page.

A notary confirmed that the publication remained online for five days.\nThe data subject stated that they had not consented to the publication of their personal data on social media.\nOn 29 April 2024, the AEPD informed VOX about the complaint and invited it to submit observations. VOX replied that the publication had been an oversight and that it deleted the post once it became aware of the issue. On 2 October 2024, the AEPD verified that the post was no longer accessible.\nOn 17 February 2025, the AEPD opened formal proceedings against VOX for a possible infringement of Article 6 GDPR. VOX argued that the publication was unintentional, that it had caused no real harm, that it had acted in good faith, and that the fine would be disproportionate.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe AEPD held that VOX had processed personal data by publishing the proof of delivery on Facebook. The authority considered that VOX acted as controller because it determined the purpose and means of the publication.\nThe AEPD found that the processing had no legal basis under Article 6 GDPR.

The authority also held that the later deletion of the post did not remove the infringement, although it could reduce the fine.\nThe AEPD concluded that VOX had infringed Article 6 GDPR. It imposed an administrative fine of €500."

        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nOn 2 May 2023, a person identifying themself under the name of the data subject lodged a complaint with the DPA against a controller, a court. This complaint alleged that the controller had not provided information as required by Article 13 and Article 14 GDPR.\nOn 24 January 2024, the data subject filed an inactivity suit against the DPA on the same matter, requesting access to the administrative file.\nIn a procedural order on 25 January 2024, the court requested the alleged data subject to provide proof of their identity within two weeks as there were doubts about whether the person acting in the case was in fact the data subject.\nOn 6 February 2024, a submission arrived under the data subject’s name with a declaration of personal and economic circumstances and other documents, noting the data subject was unable to attend due to illness. \nA follow-up order on 9 February 2024 reminded the data subject of the identity requirement and sought justification for why access to the file should be transmitted in print or electronic form. No further response was received and no evidence of identity was provided.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nFirst, the court found that the person acting as the data subject had not demonstrated that they were the person affected by the underlying complaint procedure towards the supervisory authority. \nThe court noted numerous indicators suggesting that the person acting in the procedure might not be the data subject, including failure to respond to repeated requests to prove identity, absence from the hearing, failure to provide requested medical evidence and personal/economic declarations. The court also referenced similar earlier cases by the same person (like 29 K 8881/22) where identity doubts had arisen.\nBecause the person continued to press cases without establishing identity, the court stated it would in future simply file such claims rather than decide them.\nAs a result, the objective and subjective elements of a legal interest in pursuing the alleged claim could not be established.\nFinally, the court held that that a performance claim such as an inactivity suit generally requires that the person bringing the action is the actual holder of the alleged substantive right. Hence, the lawsuit was inadmissible because the person posing as the data subject lacked a legal interest in protection under Article 77 GDPR."

        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nA data subject filed a lawsuit against Propuls d.o.o., the controller and publisher of the news portal direktno.hr, claiming that two articles published on 11 January 2023 and 31 January 2023 disclosed her personal data without her consent:\nThe first article reported on payments related to the football club Dinamo Zagreb and included the data subject’s full name, bank account number, and payment amounts. The second article referred to the first article via a hyperlink but did not mention the data subject directly.\nThe data subject argued that the disclosure violated her right to privacy and the protection of personal and family life under Croatian law and GDPR. She claimed non-material damage and sought compensation as well as publication of the court decision in the controller's news portal.\nThe controller admitted publishing the articles but argued that the information was accurate and that publishing the data served the public interest. The controller also stated that it had issued a correction upon the data subject request and argued that journalistic activity may be exempt from certain obligations under GDPR and it's exempt from liability if the facts concerned are true according to the Croatian Media. \nThe evidence included the published articles, the correction request, witness testimony from journalists and the data subject, and financial records.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe court held that the controller violated the data subject’s right to privacy and the protection of personal and family life. It reasoned that publishing her full name, bank account number, and payment amounts was disproportionate because the details were not necessary to inform the public about the football club payments. \nFollowing the ECHR jurisprudence, the court applied a proportionality test, balancing the controller’s freedom of expression against data subject's privacy rights under the Croatian Constitution and civil law. The court emphasised that the data subject was not a public figure, had not voluntarily exposed her private life to the media, and did not participate in public debate in a way that could justify disclosing her sensitive data.\nThe court also addressed the controller’s argument regarding journalistic freedom. It recognised that journalists may publish personal data when there is an overriding public interest, such as exposing wrongdoing or contributing to an important debate. However, in this case, the disclosure of the data subject’s bank account and payment amounts was unnecessary for the story’s public interest. The court noted that general information about club payments could have been reported without identifying her.\nRegarding the harm suffered, the court found that the data subject experienced non-material damage, including emotional stress and intrusion into her private and family life. It awarded €3,000 in damages with statutory interest, while rejecting the additional claim of €3,636.14 as excessive. The court also denied the data subject’s request to publish the decision, explaining that publishing it could further disclose her personal data and undermine her privacy rights."

        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nOn 20 November 2023, the data subject (a business owner) submitted an access request under Article 15(1) GDPR limited to the controller's legal department (a municipal authority), requesting a full written response and copies in accordance with Article 15(3) GDPR.\nOn 12 December 2023, the controller asked the data subject to specify a reference date in order to process the request. On 18 December 2023, the data subject replied that no specific date was required and that the relevant date for the time limit to respond to such requests was the date of receipt.\nBy letter dated 3 January 2024, the controller informed the data subject that the legal department did not store or process any personal data relating to them.\nFollowing that, the data subject alleged that the controller had not responded within the time limit set out in Article 12(3) GDPR. They argued that the one-month deadline expired on 22 December 2023 and that the request for a reference date did not suspend or extend the deadline.\nThe controller argued that the request was excessive and made in bad faith. It submitted that the data subject had repeatedly exercised access rights between 2020 and 2024 in order to pursue unrelated damages claims. It also argued that the one-month period started only after the data subject responded to the request for a reference date.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe court first held that a controller must provide information on measures taken under Articles 15 to 22 GDPR without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. The period may only be extended by two further months where justified by the complexity or number of requests, and the controller must inform the data subject of the extension and the reasons within the initial one-month period.\nThe court explained that the triggering event for the time limit was the receipt of the request on 22 November 2023, as the Article 12 GDPR and Article 15 GDPR did not require a data subject to specify a reference date for an access request. In the absence of a specified date, an access request shall be interpreted as referring to all processing up to the date of receipt. The court emphasised that the purpose of Article 15 GDPR, read in light of Recital 63, was to enable the data subject to obtain transparency and to verify the lawfulness of processing. Requiring a reference date would undermine that objective.\nIt also rejected the argument that the request was abusive. The fact that the data subject had previously submitted access requests or pursued damages did not, in itself, constitute misuse of rights.\nFinally, the court concluded that the controller’s request for a reference date was not justified and had not provided the information within the set time limit."

        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nThe data subject had a mobile contract with the controller, a telecommunications company, starting 17 April 2019. The contract included privacy notices stating that personal data, including contract initiation, execution, and completion (“positive data”), could be sent to a credit scoring agency for credit scoring, under Article 6(1)(b) and (f) GDPR.\nThe data subject did not provide explicit consent. On 18 April 2019, the controller transmitted positive data to the credit scoring agency. On 12 October 2023, the data subject received a credit report confirming this transmission. The report showed a high credit score and contained no negative entries.\nThe data subject claimed this transmission caused immaterial harm, including loss of control over personal data, stress, and fear of economic disadvantage. They requested compensation of €5,000, a permanent injunction against future positive data transmission without consent. \nThe controller argued that the transmission served legitimate interests, namely fraud prevention and accurate risk assessment, and that the data had been deleted by the credit scoring agency between October and November 2023.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nFirst, the court confirmed that fraud prevention constituted a legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. Alternative measures, such as staff training, only offering pre-paid contracts, or sectoral data pools, were insufficient.\nSecond, the court carried out a proportionality assessment. The data subject’s interest in data protection and economic security did not outweigh the controller’s interest. The positive data were accurate, non-sensitive, and had been disclosed transparently in contract documents. The data subject’s score was high, and the data had been deleted already, eliminating the risk of further adverse effects.\nThird, the court decided the data subject did not demonstrate immaterial damage under Article 82(1) GDPR. The claimed loss of control, stress, and anxiety over future transactions were hypothetical and lacked concrete causation or impact. Mere apprehension of future misuse was insufficient.\nFinally, the court concluded that there was no violation of GDPR obligations, as processing was justified under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. Consequently, the court dismissed the data subject’s claims."
