The platform processed the personal data of over 2.1 million individuals, primarily children and young people.\nIn January 2025, the processor experienced a cyberattack that enabled the attacker to access and extract a large volume of personal data. The stolen data included names, contact details, social security numbers, association affiliation, and sensitive health data. The data were later published on the Darknet, exposing the affected data subjects to significant privacy risks.\nThe processor reported the breach to the Swedish DPA (IMY), the day after the cyberattack occurred. Then IMY initiated an investigation to assess whether the processor had implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures under Article 32 GDPR.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nIMY held that the processor violated Article 32 GDPR by failing to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data.\nIMY found that processor’s security measures were insufficient and disproportionate to the risks associated with the processing and concluded that the processor was aware of vulnerabilities and elevated risks in its systems prior to the attack, yet failed to take adequate corrective action. The processor lacked proper risk analysis, security monitoring, intrusion detection, and preventive security controls. \nIMY further determined that these deficiencies reflected passivity and inadequate security governance, and therefore the security level was not appropriate given the scale of the data processing and the sensitivity of the data, especially considering that a large portion of the data concerned children.\nAs a result, IMY held that the processor breached Article 32 GDPR and imposed an administrative sanction fee of SEK 6,000,000 (€560,000)"

Furthermore, it also obtained personal data for direct marketing purposes from a third-party provider, in which case it relied on consent under Article 22(2) UK PECR. \nThe controller further alleged that the data subjects who filed complaints with the DPA had opted in to receiving marketing communications. \nThe DPA’s inspection of a third-party website providing personal data to the controller showed that it was unclear whether individuals could consent to specific third parties for direct marketing, out of the 300 plus organisations listed.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe DPA analysed if the controller obtained valid consent for sending direct marketing, as well as if the controller was able to rely on the exception to the consent rule. \nFirstly, the DPA found that the consent was not informed, since data subjects were unable to select which companies they wished to receive marketing from, out of over 300 entities listed, on the third-party website.  \nAlternatively, the DPA explained that the exception to the consent rule for direct marketing can only be relied upon by the controller that collected the contact details of the data subject. In this case, the controller obtained the data from a third party and thus could not rely on the exception. \nTherefore, the DPA found that the controller violated Article 22 UK PECR by sending over 67 million emails using data sourced from third parties for the purposes of direct marketing without valid consent. The DPA fined the controller GBP 105,000 (approximately €120,000)."

        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nAustria implemented a public register of beneficial owners (WiEReG) in order to comply with EU anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing rules. The register contains personal data of natural persons who ultimately own or control legal entities, including sensitive information such as name, date of birth, nationality, residence, and the type and extent of their economic interest. These data are collected from multiple sources, including the company register, association register, foundation and fund register, tax authorities, Statistics Austria, other state registers, and direct reporting by the legal entities themselves. The register originally allowed public access to this information for anyone.\nThe data subject in this case was a beneficial owner of a private foundation and a member of its foundation board. He requested that the Federal Minister of Finance, acting as the register authority and controller, restrict public access to his data in the register or block it entirely. He argued that making his personal data publicly accessible violated his constitutional rights to privacy and data protection and breached GDPR rules, especially because he was not notified of access and could not control who viewed his data. The Federal Minister of Finance rejected the request on 3 August 2022, stating that the data subject’s status as a beneficial owner was already evident from other public registers, particularly the company register, so there was no reason to block access.\nThe data subject appealed to the Federal Administrative Court, which dismissed the appeal on 5 October 2022. The court held that the data subject was registered in the beneficial ownership register due to his company holdings, and that his residence was already blocked from view in the register. However, the court also emphasized that this did not change the overall public accessibility of his beneficial ownership status, because the company register is publicly accessible without any requirement of legitimate interest. The data subject then appealed to the Constitutional Court.\nDuring this time, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) issued its judgment in the “World Cup” case on 22 November 2022. The CJEU held that public access to beneficial ownership information for everyone constitutes a serious interference with the data subject’s privacy rights and is disproportionate. It stated that access should be limited to persons with a legitimate interest, such as journalists, NGOs, financial institutions, or authorities. Following this decision, Austria amended §10 WiEReG, introducing a legitimate interest requirement for access.\nOn 5 December 2023, the Constitutional Court ruled that the earlier version of §10 WiEReG was unconstitutional because it violated privacy rights, and therefore annulled the earlier Federal Administrative Court decision that had relied on that provision. The case was sent back for reconsideration under the new legal framework.\nIn the second administrative process, the Federal Administrative Court again dismissed the data subject’s request. The data subject argued that the legitimate interest requirement remained too broad and could still allow almost anyone (including journalists and NGOs) to access the register, thus undermining his privacy. The data subject also cited risks of personal harm, claiming that industrialists and their families had been targets of kidnappings and therefore his situation justified access restriction. \nThe data subject appealed again to the Constitutional Court, asserting violations of fundamental rights and requesting annulment of the administrative court’s decision, while also seeking a preliminary ruling from the CJEU.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe Austrian Constitutional Court held that the earlier version of §10 WiEReG, which granted unrestricted public access to the register of beneficial owners, violated the constitutional right to privacy and data protection under §1 DSG and Article 8 of The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union because it allowed the disclosure of sensitive personal data without a proportionate justification. The Court therefore declared this version unconstitutional.\nHowever, the Court also found that the amended version of §10 WiEReG, which limits access to those who can demonstrate a legitimate interest, is constitutional because it better balances transparency objectives with the data protection right and aligns with the requirements of the CJEU’s World Cup ruling. Consequently, the data subject’s request to block access to his data was rejected, as the revised legal framework permits access only under the legitimate-interest requirement and does not unlawfully interfere with fundamental rights, and in particular with the right regarding the protection of personal data."

On 20 July 2020, the controller dismissed him for serious misconduct, alleging a breach of confidentiality obligations in the employee selection process. The misconduct consisted, inter alia, of influencing recruitment decisions following improper pressure and coordinating obstructive behaviour during internal investigations.\nThe controller relied on messages exchanged via Amazon Chime, an internal company chat application used by employees through corporate accounts. The data subject challenged the admissibility of these messages, arguing that their use amounted to unlawful monitoring of employee communications.\nThe Court of Appeal of Turin dismissed the data subject’s challenge and upheld the dismissal. It found that Amazon Chime qualified as a work tool under Italian labour law and that the controller had provided adequate information to employees about the use of company IT systems and the possibility that communications could be monitored and used for disciplinary purposes. The Court of Appeal also held that the monitoring constituted lawful “defensive controls”, carried out after a founded suspicion of misconduct had arisen, based on reports from a colleague.\nThe data subject appealed to the Supreme Court, contesting in particular the lawfulness of the monitoring and the timing of the collection of chat data.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe Supreme Court declared the appeal inadmissible.\nThe Court held that the judgment of the Court of Appeal rested on two independent grounds, each sufficient to uphold the dismissal. First, the appellate court had classified Amazon Chime as a work tool under Article 4(2) of the Workers’ Statute, allowing the use of data obtained from it for disciplinary purposes, provided that employees were adequately informed and data protection rules were respected. Second, the court had found that the monitoring qualified as lawful defensive control, triggered by a founded suspicion of misconduct and carried out after that suspicion had arisen.\nThe Supreme Court found that the data subject had failed to challenge the first ground, namely the classification of the company chat as a work tool and the adequacy of the information provided to employees. According to settled case law, where a judgment is based on multiple autonomous grounds, an appeal is admissible only if all of them are contested. Because this requirement was not met, the appeal was inadmissible regardless of the merits of the remaining arguments.\nIn addition, the Court reiterated that defensive controls by an employer are permissible where they are aimed at investigating specific unlawful conduct, are based on a founded suspicion, and are limited to data collected after that suspicion arises. In cases of misconduct that has already occurred, accessing existing data may be the only effective means of investigation.\nAs a result, the dismissal remained valid and the data subject’s appeal was rejected on procedural grounds."

The article included information about the criminal proceedings and identified the data subject by name, while omitting his surname.\nThe data subject initiated civil proceedings against the controller, arguing that the publication unlawfully interfered with his right to privacy and data protection, in particular under Article 10 GDPR. He claimed that the disclosure of his identity and professional background made him easily identifiable and caused disproportionate reputational harm. He further argued that the offence was relatively minor and did not justify such intrusive reporting.\nThe controller argued that it had acted within its journalistic freedom and fulfilled its duty to inform the public about serious criminal offences. It maintained that sufficient care had been taken to limit identification by omitting the data subject’s surname and that the reporting was accurate, balanced, and in the public interest.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe Court rejected the data subject’s claims and held that the publication was lawful.\nThe Court carried out a balancing exercise between the data subject’s right to respect for private life under Article 8 ECHR and the controller’s freedom of expression under Article 10 ECHR, as required when applying Article 10 GDPR. It found that the balance weighed in favour of the controller.\nIn particular, the Court held that the article was based on accurate and established facts, namely a criminal conviction. The disclosure contributed to a debate of general public interest, as sexual exploitation of minors, especially in the context of online platforms, raises serious societal concerns, regardless of the data subject’s characterisation of the offence as “light”.\nThe Court further considered the data subject’s professional background and found that mentioning his profession was justified, as it had been relevant in the criminal sentencing and omitting it could have led to unwarranted suspicion of others in the same profession. The Court emphasised that the right to protection of reputation cannot be relied upon where reputational damage is a foreseeable consequence of one’s own criminal conduct.\nFinally, the Court found that the controller had acted proportionately, that sufficient steps had been taken to limit identification, and that the overall content, form, and consequences of the publication did not require rectification or compensation."

It held that documents the data subject themself authored (such as emails and letters to the controller) are in their entirety personal data and must be supplied as copies because the personal data is inherent in the document. Documents or parts of documents created by the controller (such as telephone notes, file memos, minutes, letters from the controller, or investment subscription forms) are not wholly personal data of the data subject as they may contain mixed information. \nSecond, it clarified that the controller must provide only those portions that constitute the data subject’s personal data and need not turn over entire documents if parts are unrelated to the personal data. \nFinally, the court therefore limited the data subject’s entitlement to copies of their own emails and letters held by the controller and dismissed requests for broader document disclosure."

The Microsoft Corporation operates worldwide and is headquartered in the United States. Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited is a subsidiary of the controller, however, fundamental decisions that significantly influence the direction, design, and operation of Microsoft products are taken at the controller's headquarters.\nThe data subject was a pupil attending an Austrian school that used Microsoft 365 Education for teaching purposes. She was provided with a school Microsoft account and, while logged into this account and creating a document using the browser-based version of Microsoft Word, several cookies were installed on her device. These cookies were set without her consent, and the controller made no attempt to obtain such consent. Schools had little or no possibility to influence or configure the cookie settings. \nThe data subject’s representatives lodged a complaint with the Austrian Data Protection Authority (DSB), alleging violations of Article 6 GDPR in connection with the installation of tracking cookies without a legal basis, as well as violations of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and Article 28(3) GDPR.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe Austrian Data Protection Authority (DSB) held that the Microsoft Corporation qualifies as a controller within the meaning of Article 4(7) GDPR, as it determines the purposes and means of processing in connection with Microsoft 365 Education. In assessing controllership, the DSB examined the relationship between Microsoft Corporation and Microsoft Ireland Operations in light of the CJEU’s broad interpretation of the concept of controller.\nReferring to settled CJEU case law, the DSB emphasized that data protection liability may arise where an entity issues binding guidelines, technical specifications, protocols, or contractual frameworks governing data processing, even if the actual processing is carried out by another entity. Likewise, active involvement in the development of a digital product and the specification of key parameters suffices to establish controllership, even where technical implementation is delegated to another body. \nMicrosoft Corporation’s influence extends beyond mere strategic oversight. It developed Microsoft 365 Education, continues to lead its technical development, sets binding corporate guidelines, and determines the technical and organizational parameters of data processing, including the use of cookies for its own business and analytical purposes. So, the DSB concluded that Microsoft Corporation must be regarded as a controller under Article 4(7) GDPR.\nThe DSB further found that the cookies set during the use of Microsoft 365 Education constitute personal data within the meaning of Article 4(1) GDPR, as they enable the individualization of users and may be combined with additional information. These cookies were not technically necessary, as they served analytics, tracking, and operational purposes rather than the provision of the expressly requested service.\nAs no valid consent was obtained and no other legal basis under Article 6(1) GDPR applied, the processing was unlawful and violated the principles of lawfulness and fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. In particular, reliance on legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR was excluded due to the prior breach of e-privacy consent requirements.\nConsequently, the DSB ordered the controller to cease the use of technically unnecessary cookies without valid consent within four weeks."

While the DPA found an infringement and issued a reprimand against the employer, it rejected the complaint insofar as the data subject sought further corrective measures.\nThe Data Protection Board of Appeal subsequently held that the data subject lacked a legal interest in appealing the DPA’s decision, arguing that the right to an effective remedy under Article 78 GDPR primarily protects persons on whom the decision has direct legal effects, and that national procedural law may limit who has standing to seek judicial review.\nThe Ombudsman disagreed and challenged this restrictive interpretation, relying on CJEU case law, including Schufa cases and Land Hessen. \n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe Ombudsman argued that Article 78(1) GDPR grants both data subjects and controllers the right to an effective remedy against supervisory authority decisions, including review of the authority’s choice of corrective measures under Article 58(2) GDPR. The Ombudsman also referred to Recital 141 GDPR and Article 47 of the EU Charter, emphasizing the need for full judicial review where a supervisory authority fails to intervene adequately to protect a data subject’s rights. Restricting data subjects to cases of ongoing violations, risks undermining uniform enforcement of the GDPR and lowering the level of data protection.\nThe data subject must have the right to an effective judicial remedy under Article 78(1) GDPR against all aspects of a supervisory authority’s decision, including the selection and adequacy of corrective measures. This right is not limited to situations where the decision has binding legal effects on the data subject, nor may it be excluded by national procedural rules."

At those occasions, the company collected personal data such as IP addresses, identity information, and contact details. \nThe controller collected personal data via a membership form, asking data subjects if they wanted to join the loyalty program with a push button “yes/no”. When joining the program, the data subject was invited to consent to receive “loyalty offers” via SMS and email. \nThe controller transmitted some of these data to a social media company which matched the data with the profiles of their users in order to show targeted advertising. The data sets concerned approximately 10.8 millions of clients, out of which 1.6 million received targeted advertising. \nThe DPA opened an investigation into the controller in 2023 after two inspections (online and on-site). \n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe DPA found that, since the membership form did not contain information on the transmission of members' data to the social media platform, or even on targeted advertising, the consent was not informed nor specific. Therefore, it found the processing to be unlawful, violating Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. \nFurthermore, the DPA noted that the information regarding this processing activity was hard to find for data subjects. The data subject needed to find the links to the information, which was far from the consent button, at the end of the page. Then, the data subject had to consult two documents, each one containing a part of the information. Moreover, the data retention period was not indicated and the purpose of targeted advertising was not visible on the page. Therefore, the DPA found a violation of Article 13 GDPR. \nIn addition, the DPA found a violation of Article 32 GDPR. The DPA found that the controller's password policy and the storage conditions did not meet the required security standards.  \nRegarding the obligation to conduct a privacy impact assessment, the DPA noted that the controller processed a large amount of personal data while also cross-referencing some of these data with a social media database. Therefore, the DPA found a violation of Article 35 GDPR.  \nFinally, the DPA found that the controller's website placed optional cookies on the user's terminal without consent in violation of Article 82 LIL, transposing Article 5(2) of the ePrivacy Directive 2002/58. \nTherefore, the DPA issued two fines to the controller, one of €2,500,000 for violations of Article 6(1)(a) GDPR, Article 13 GDPR, Article 32 GDPR and Article 35 GDPR, and one fine of €1,000,000 for a violation of Article 82 LIL."

(the Data Controller) entered into an agreement with a Chinese company (known as Bussiness Company N° 2) and a third party, under which the Controller would provide customer service activities for the Spanish market.\nOn 15 January 2024, employees were informed of the existence of the agreement. However, the general contractual terms were not provided until 6 February 2024, when the contract was already being performed, and were signed only by the HR representative. The notice stated that employees´ personal data would be shared with the counterparties solely for the execution of the agreement.\nDuring training sessions, employees were asked to write down their personal mobile phone numbers and dates of birth on a blank sheet of paper. This information was required to receive authentication credentials for accessing the Client’s platform. No specific privacy notice or additional information regarding the data transfer was provided.\nSome employees subsequently received SMS messages directly from the Client on their personal phones, despite having given no explicit authorization. Union representatives suggested using corporate email addresses as an alternative authentication method, but this option was rejected, as the Client required the mobile phone number as a double authentication factor.\nIn its response to the DPA, the data controller argued that the Client’s platform required two-factor authentication via mobile phone and that, due to the lack of corporate devices, employees’ personal phones were used on a temporary basis, despite the Data Protection Officer having advised against this practice.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe DPA upheld the complaint and found an infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR. The Authority clarified that the necessity for the performance of a contract must be interpreted strictly and covers only processing that is objectively necessary, not merely useful or convenient.\nThe Authority concluded that requiring employees to use their personal mobile phones as a double authentication factor in an employment relationship is unlawful, a position previously confirmed by the Spanish National Court (SAN 487/2024 ECLI:ES:AN2024:847). Employers should had been required to provide the necessary work tools and could not rely on employees’ personal devices when less intrusive alternatives exist.\nThe DPA also found that the Controller failed to properly follow the recommendations of its Data Protection Officer. The Authority considered that the damage caused could have been avoided.\nThe DPA imposed a €80,000 fine. In determining the amount of the fine, the Authority applied the criteria set out in Article 83(2) GDPR."
