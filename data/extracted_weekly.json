        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nOn 14 March 2023, a third party impersonating a data subject contacted Telefónica Móviles España, S.A.(the controller) through its customer service telephone channel and requested a change of ownership of a mobile phone line. The controller processed the request and changed the ownership of the line. On the following day, 15 March 2023, a physical store issued a duplicate SIM card for the same line to the person registered as the new owner. After these events, the data subject lost access to their mobile service and suffered unauthorised bank transactions.\nThe data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD). During the investigation, the AEPD examined the controller’s internal procedures for changes of ownership and SIM duplication. These procedures required several identity checks, including additional verification through a confirmation call or a one-time password when a request was not made from the affected line. The AEPD reviewed call recordings, system logs, and the documentation used in the store. The controller acknowledged that, in this case, its agents did not apply all required verification steps. On 5 December 2024, the AEPD opened formal sanctioning proceedings against the controller.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe AEPD held that the controller unlawfully processed personal data in two distinct processing operations: the change of ownership of the mobile line and the subsequent issuance of a duplicate SIM card. The AEPD found that the controller breached the principle of lawfulness because it failed to apply its own mandatory identity-verification measures. As a result, personal data were accessed and processed without a valid legal basis under Article 6(1). \nThe AEPD emphasised that a controller must not only define appropriate technical and organisational measures, but must also ensure their effective application in practice. Failures by employees or distributors to follow internal procedures remained attributable to the controller.\nThe AEPD rejected the controller’s argument that the processing was lawful on the basis of contract performance. It held that, due to the absence of proper identity verification, the controller could not rely on Article 6(1)(b) because it had not ensured that the request came from the data subject or with their consent.\nThe AEPD also rejected the argument that fraud by a third party excluded the controller’s responsibility, stating that the controller remained responsible for ensuring that its security measures were effectively applied by its agents and distributors.\nIn addition, the AEPD held that the absence of intent did not exclude liability, as administrative liability under the GDPR does not require deliberate misconduct where the controller failed to exercise the required level of diligence.\nFinally, the AEPD dismissed controller’s claims concerning the expiry of the proceedings and criminal prejudiciality. It found that the investigation was initiated within the applicable statutory time limits and that the administrative proceedings protected the fundamental right to data protection, which differed from the legal interests examined in any criminal proceedings against the impersonating third party. \nThe AEPD classified the infringement as serious under Article 83(5)(a) GDPR and imposed a fine of €300,000."

        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nOn 28 January 2025, the Croatian Personal Data Protection Agency (AZOP) dismissed a complaint from a data subject who alleged that an education inspector had disclosed his personal data to the principal of a music school in Rijeka. The data subject claimed that the inspector copied him on an email to the principal without his consent, revealing his identity and breaching the GDPR and the Croatian implementing act. AZOP rejected the complaint, stating that there were no legal grounds to open a procedure, without assessing whether the data subject’s rights had been violated. They argued that the data subject’s allegations were about breaches of sectoral rules governing inspections, not about GDPR violations and consequently they lacked competence. The data subject challenged this decision before the Administrative Court in Rijeka.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe Administrative Court in Rijeka annulled AZOP’s decision and sent the case back for reconsideration. The court held that AZOP could not rule on breaches of the Education Inspection Act or the inspector’s disciplinary responsibilities. However, as an independent supervisory authority under Article 51 GDPR, AZOP was competent and obliged to assess whether the data subject’s personal data had been unlawfully processed. The court found that AZOP should have examined the complaint on its merits rather than dismissing it on procedural grounds. The court required AZOP to establish the full facts, determine if unlawful processing occurred, and issue a substantive decision within 60 days. AZOP was ordered to reimburse the data subject €1,000 for legal costs while other cost claims were denied."

        "text": "Contents\n\n1 English Summary\n\n1.1 Facts\n1.2 Advocate General Opinion\n1.3 Holding\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nAB Storstockholms Lokaltrafik (the controller), the operator of public transport in Stockholm, equipped its ticket inspectors with body-worn cameras that continuously recorded video and audio during inspections. The cameras had a short circular memory, automatically overwriting footage unless inspectors saved it when issuing fines or facing threats. The stated purposes of the cameras were to prevent and document violence against inspectors and to verify the identity of fined passengers.\nFollowing a supervisory investigation, the Swedish Data Protection Authority found that the controller had infringed several provisions of the GDPR, including the obligation to provide information to data subjects. The Authority imposed an administrative fine in total SEK 16,000,000 (€1,420,670) of which SEK 4,000,000 (€355,188) was for failure to provide information to the data subjects.\nThe controller challenged the Swedish DPA’s decision before the Administrative court of first instance (Förvaltningsrätten i Stockholm), which upheld the fine. The controller then appealed to the Administrative Court of Appeal (Kammarrätten i Stockholm), which annulled the fine, holding that Article 13 GDPR was not applicable.\nThe Swedish DPA subsequently appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden (Högsta förvaltningsdomstolen). The referring court identified the key issue as whether Article 13 GDPR or Article 14 GDPR applies to personal data collected by body-worn cameras. Resolving this question was necessary to determine the content, timing, and possible exceptions of the information obligation and to assess whether the Authority was entitled to impose an administrative fine for non-compliance with Article 13 GDPR.\nThe court also noted uncertainty regarding the legal weight of the Article 29 Working Party’s Guidelines on transparency, which provide that Article 13 GDPR applies to video surveillance. In these circumstances, the Supreme Administrative Court stayed the proceedings and referred the question to the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\nAdvocate General Opinion[edit | edit source]\nThe Advocate General explained that body cameras used by ticket inspectors collect personal data directly from individuals, even if the person is unaware of being recorded. Therefore, Article 13 GDPR applies, meaning the controller must provide information to the data subjects at the time of collection. This can be done through measures such as warning signs or a layered approach, ensuring people are aware their data is being recorded and can exercise their rights. Article 14 GDPR, which applies to data obtained from other sources, is not applicable in this situation.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe Court of Justice held that, where personal data are collected by means of a body camera worn by ticket inspectors on public transport, the obligation to provide information to data subjects is governed by Article 13 GDPR, not Article 14 GDPR. The Court reasoned that body-camera recordings involve the collection of personal data directly from the data subject. The activity or passivity of the data subject is irrelevant, it is the controller’s act of collecting the data that is decisive. Article 14 applies only where personal data are obtained from a source other than the data subject.\nMoreover, the court held that this interpretation was reinforced by the GDPR’s context. Article 13 GDPR gives concrete expression to the data subject’s right to be informed at the time of collection, whereas Article 14 GDPR is designed for situations where data are collected indirectly from third parties, making immediate information impractical. Applying Article 14 GDPR to body-camera recordings would undermine the principle of transparency laid down in Article 5 GDPR and 12 GDPR. Also, applying Article 14 GDPR in such circumstances would risk enabling hidden surveillance, since data subjects would not necessarily be informed at the time their data are collected.\nFinally, the Court clarified that its earlier judgment in Ryneš did not address the distinction between Articles 13 GDPR and 14 GDPR and therefore did not support applying Article 14 GDPR in the present context."

        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nThe complainant alleged that his neighbours installed a video surveillance system at a combined residence and restaurant that monitored parts of his adjacent property and nearby public space. He reported the presence of three cameras (a rotating camera outside the restaurant, a fixed camera inside the premises, and a rotating camera on the rear residential floor) and requested the HDPA to ensure their removal. He later submitted photographs, technical specifications and video footage demonstrating the rotation of the rear camera, and requested specific recordings for use in judicial proceedings.\nThe complainant exercised his right of access by registered letters addressed to both neighbours and notified to the HDPA, seeking footage from the shop and residential cameras for periods during which he or his family members were within their field of view, as well as from any other device processing their personal data. Following information on the procedure, he reiterated his complaint, alleging that the controllers had failed to provide the requested material.\nThe controllers stated that the system was installed to address incidents of theft and vandalism, consisting of only two cameras: one monitoring the business premises and one at the rear of the residence aimed at their stable. They asserted that the cameras did not monitor public areas or third parties’ property, did not record audio, and stored footage on internal memory cards for five days only, after which it was automatically deleted. They further claimed that any older footage had been erased by the time the access request was received and that footage relating to a serious shop incident had been provided to the Prosecutor.\nThe complainant subsequently submitted photographs and video footage originating from the controllers and communicated to him by the competent Police Department, showing that the cameras were capable of controlled panning and captured images of his neighbouring property, recording the movements of his family members, contrary to the controllers’ statements.\nAccording to a technician’s report submitted by the controllers, the front camera was not operational and the rear camera had become misaligned due to weather conditions, temporarily capturing the neighbouring property; the cameras were removed for repair and re-adjustment. Nevertheless, the complainant maintained that the cameras continued to cover his property and emphasised their advanced technical capabilities, including pan control, day and night recording, image transmission, motion detection, two-way communication and audio recording.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe HDPA found the controllers were acting jointly in relation to the CCTV system that unlawfully captured the complainant’s property and public areas. They breached articles 5(1)(a,b) and 5(2) (lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, accountability) and Articles 12 and 15 GDPR.The HDPA ordered adjustments to the camera field of view, restricted pan/tilt use, and required the respondents to report compliance within one month. Administrative fines of €2,000 (Article 5) and €1,000 (Article 15) were imposed on each controller."

On 24 January 2023, the data subject received a form and instructions from the controller. They contacted the controller’s courier service as instructed and received a shipping label issued by Dynamic Express Courier S.L., a temporary processor used by the controller. On 26 January 2023, an employee of a subcontracted courier, Autoradio, collected an envelope from the data subject. The envelope contained the completed form, a copy of the data subject’s identity document, and the shipping label.\nThe controller did not receive the documentation. Between 2 and 16 February 2023, the data subject contacted the controller several times. The controller informed them that the documentation had not arrived and that inquiries with different courier companies were ongoing. Dynamic had not reported any incident during the contractual relationship, which complicated the controller’s investigation. The controller later confirmed the loss of the documentation and acknowledged that it had attempted unsuccessfully to locate the shipment through all involved providers. The controller ended its contract with Dynamic in February 2023, shortly after the incident.\nDuring the investigation, the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) reviewed the contract between the controller and its processor. The contract included a data protection clause and a list of security measures. It also set out situations in which penalties could be applied to the processor, but no penalties had been imposed because Dynamic did not report any incident. The AEPD opened proceedings on 10 January 2025 to assess whether the controller had complied with its obligations under Article 32 GDPR, particularly regarding the supervision of its processor and the security of the processing operations involving physical documents.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe AEPD held that the controller violated Article 32 GDPR because it did not ensure adequate technical and organisational measures to protect the personal data handled by its processor. The AEPD found that the controller did not exercise sufficient supervision over Dynamic and did not verify whether the processor applied the agreed security controls. The loss of the documentation, the absence of any incident report from the processor, and the controller’s inability to trace the shipment showed shortcomings in the controller’s risk management and its oversight of processors.\nThe AEPD proposed an administrative fine of €500,000 for the infringement. Before the final decision, the controller chose to make a voluntary payment under Spanish Administrative Procedure Law. This reduced the fine by 20%, resulting in a final payment of €400,000."

        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nOn 16 July 2021, a data subject and a bank (the controller) concluded a Custody Agreement for Financial Instruments. Under this agreement, the bank had to open a custody account for the data subject, safeguard and settle financial instruments, report on account activity, collect income, and keep the data subject informed about the status and changes of the custody account. On the same day, the parties also concluded a Service Agreement, which defined the rights and obligations related to that service. Article 4 of this agreement required the bank to keep all client information confidential in accordance with applicable laws and prohibited disclosure to third parties without written consent or a legal basis.\nOn 11 January 2023, the controller mistakenly sent the data subject’s monthly custodial account statement, which contained sensitive personal and financial data, to another client instead of the data subject. The controller requested that the unintended recipient delete the email and corrected the technical error. The data subject remained uncertain about the extent of the data disclosure. \nSubsequently, she initiated a lawsuit claiming that this incident caused stress, anxiety, discomfort, and a loss of trust in the controller, and requested compensation for non-material damages.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe Court held that the controller violated the data subject’s right to privacy under Croatian law and that this violation constituted non-material damage. It also referred to the violation of GDPR, without pointing out any specific article.\nThe court explained that the right to privacy is a personal non-property right that gives an individual full authority over their private life, including the ability to exclude others from accessing, collecting, or disclosing personal data without consent. Because the controller, a bank entrusted with confidential financial information, sent the data subject’s account statement to another client without consent, the court found that the disclosure amounted to an unauthorized intrusion into the data subject’s privacy.\nThe court then assessed whether monetary compensation was justified. It emphasised that the controller did not provide the misdirected email, which prevented verification of the exact content disclosed. Although the controller asserted that only a monthly custody account statement was sent and that the unintended recipient deleted the message, the court held that these claims did not eliminate uncertainty about what was actually shared or whether it was further disseminated. This uncertainty increased the seriousness of the violation because the data subject could not know the full scope of possible consequences. The court therefore accepted that the data subject experienced mental distress, fear, and ongoing concern about how their personal and financial data might have been used.\nThe court rejected the controller’s argument that no harm occurred because the data subject remained a client. It noted that the data subject terminated one of the custody accounts after the incident, reflecting a change in trust, but that the continuation of some services did not negate the harm suffered.\nWhen determining the amount of compensation, the court considered the intensity and duration of the data subject’s anxiety, including discomfort arising from knowing that another person had access to their personal and financial information and fears of potential burglary or extortion. The court also highlighted that the controller is a financial institution, which carries a heightened duty of professionalism and diligence due to the sensitive nature of the data it processes. Considering these circumstances and the purpose of non-material damages, the court found that €3,500 constituted fair compensation."

They indicated, however, that access could be granted after completion of the procedure, with the reviewers’ identities redacted.\nThe data subject filed a complaint with the Commissioner, the Cypriot DPA. \nThe DPA held that the controller had violated the right of access to personal data under Article 12 of Cypriot data protection law and issued a formal decision ordering the controller to ensure access, suggesting anonymization of reviewers’ names. \nThe controller then appealed that decision before the Administrative Court.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe Administrative Court annulled the DPA’s decision. It held that the DPA had failed to properly balance the data subject’s right of access under Article 15 GDPR against the legitimate interests of the controller in preserving confidentiality and procedural integrity during an ongoing promotion process. The Court emphasized that the timing of the access request was crucial and that temporary restrictions could be justified where disclosure might affect the fairness and objectivity of a complex administrative procedure.\nThe Court further found that the controller had focused too narrowly on anonymization and had not adequately considered whether deferring access until the conclusion of the promotion process would constitute a proportionate limitation of the right of access. The controller’s position was not to deny access permanently, rather, it indicated that access could be provided after the final decision, with reviewers’ names redacted."

        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nThe defendant, an insurance agent at Croatia Osiguranje d.d., had his access to company business applications revoked during his employment termination notice period in September 2021. Despite this restriction and without authorization from his employer or clients, he used the login credentials of another employee to repeatedly access internal sales applications. He then sent 41 emails containing 848 documents that included the insurance policies and personal data (names, addresses, personal identification numbers, birth dates, and phone numbers) of at least 334 clients. He first sent the data to his official work email and then forwarded it to his private email. \nThe prosecution alleged that this conduct violated the GDPR, the Croatian GDPR Implementation Act, and internal company access rules and this this constituted unauthorized use of personal data and unauthorized access to computer systems under Croatian criminal law.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe court held that the defendant committed a criminal offense against privacy. Because the defendant intentionally accessed and used personal data without permission and without a valid legal basis under Article 6(1) GDPR, the court held that he committed the criminal offense of violation of privacy under Article 146(1) of the Croatian Criminal Code. The court sentenced HIM to a prison term of three months.\nAdditionally, the court found that the defendant knowingly accessed the employer’s computer systems without authorisation. The court held that this conduct constituted a criminal offense against computer systems, programs, and data under Article 266(1) of the Croatian Criminal Code because it involved intentional interference with computer systems which the defendant had no lawful access. For this the court sentenced the defendant to a prison term of four months.\nThe court combined the sentences into a single six-month prison term. It then imposed a suspended sentence, so the prison term would not be executed if the defendant did not commit another crime within a one-year probation period. The court explained that it could revoke the suspended sentence if the defendant committed another offense that resulted in imprisonment. The court also ordered him to pay €30 in procedural costs. It held that this sanction was sufficient to prevent future violations and to fulfill the aims of punishment under Croatian law."

        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nA data subject wished to be addressed in a gender-neutral way and claimed they were misgendered by two companies (the data controllers) in profile settings, tickets, and train announcements.\nThey initially sent a tweet to one of the involved controllers asking whether gender-neutral options would be available and later filed a complaint with the Equal Treatment Commission and the Austrian Data Protection Authority (DSB), claiming a violation of their right under Article 16 GDPR. \nThe DPA rejected the complaint, arguing that the data subject had not submitted a formal request for data correction to the controllers. The complainant then appealed to the Federal Administrative Court.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe Court dismissed the appeal, holding that there was no violation of the GDPR because the data subject had not submitted a formal request for rectification. Article 16 GDPR requires a clear and specific request for correction, and vague or indirect statements, such as tweets or general demands for system-wide changes, do not satisfy this requirement.\nDuring the proceedings, it became clear that the data subject’s statements, primarily concerned the implementation of a future system change to allow a gender-neutral option for all users, rather than a concrete request to correct their own personal data. In addition, some corrections had already been made to the data subject’s profile and invoices, while oral misgendering in trains and via loudspeaker announcements was found to fall outside the scope of the GDPR, as such statements were not stored in any personal data filing system.\nFinally, the Court noted that the minutes of the Equal Treatment Commission hearing could not be relied upon as full proof, as the hearing had been recorded only in audio form and not documented in accordance with the requirements of Austrian administrative procedure law (AVG). Statements made during the Equal Treatment Commission proceedings therefore did not constitute a formal exercise of the right to rectification under Article 16 GDPR."

The communications and legal opinions within disciplinary proceedings include personal data of third parties, particularly the lawyer concerned, whose interests in confidentiality outweigh the data subject’s interest in disclosure.\nMoreover, Austrian disciplinary law (DSt) establishes statutory confidentiality obligations for disciplinary files, which constitute a permissible restriction under Article 23 GDPR.

        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nNextpublica, a software consulting company (the processor) provided the Maison Départementale pour les Personnes Handicapées MDPH, a public interest group (the controller), with software for processing files relating to persons with disabilities. This software enabled users (data subjects) to upload their files and track their progress via an online portal. \nOn 2 November and 10 November 2022, data subjects using the portal reported to the controller that they had access to files relating to other data subjects.  \nOn 22 November 2022, the controller notified the data breach to the DPA. The breach was found to be due to a configuration mistake, made by the processor. \nAfter an on-site inspection, the DPA opened an investigation.  \n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe dispute related to the processor’s responsibility for implementing adequate security measures, under article 32 GDPR. \nOn the fairness of the procedure: \nAt first, the DPA rejected the argument based on a violation of Article 6 ECHR. The DPA pointed out that the right not to incriminate oneself is not incompatible with the sharing of the complainant’s internal reports, even under coercive measures. What’s more, the disclosed reports are evidence on which the DPA can base its argument. \nAbout responsibilities: \nOn a second time, the DPA defined the responsibility of the processor. The DPA jointly appreciated article 4(8) GDPR, article 28 (3)(a) GDPR and article 32 GDPR. The DPA noted that the contract bounding the processor and the controller, as well as the processor’s expertise as a software consulting company, show that the processor was responsible for ensuring data security.\nAs a result, the processor was also responsible for its sub-processors compliance to GDPR, especially when they introduced a block of computer code on the software’s code.\nOn the violation of article 32 GDPR: \nThe DPA recalled that the definition of security measures must take into account the state of art, the cost of such measures, but also to the risks of the processing and the category of personal data considered. The rapporteur noted that the personal data considered were sensitive data, and that the security measures must adapted to such circumstances. \nTo evaluate the measures taken, the DPA referred to a principle of the National Agency for Information Systems Security (French ANSSI). The principle is that the security of an information system must be based on a coherent whole, rather than on specific security points, so that, in theory, the whole does not depend on a few security points. With this principle, the information system is supposed to balance the failure of one of its security points. \nHere, the DPA highlighted that the software was processing a lot of personal data, even sensitive data, with a high risk for data subjects in case of a violation, due to the aggregation of extremely precise and various data (health related, national identifier, financial status, identification data). \nThe processor was aware of critical and significant vulnerabilities, thanks to reports he commissioned. In addition, an internal report had identified the weakness of the information system security, particularly the use of an obsolete encryption system. \nHowever, the processor has not taken any measures to remedy the situation before a breach occurred. \nThe DPA considered that the processor had not taken sufficient measures to ensure the security of the personal data processed, and so violated article 32 GDPR. \nA fine of €1,700,000 is imposed to the processor."
