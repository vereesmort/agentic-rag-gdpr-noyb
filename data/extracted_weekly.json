        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nThe data subject had private health and long-term care insurance with the controller since 2010. Over the years, the controller adjusted the monthly insurance premiums several times, and informed the data subject of these adjustments through policy supplements and standardised explanatory letters, which the data subject no longer possessed.\nIn March 2023, the data subject requested that the controller provide copies of the documents relating to past premium adjustments. After the controller refused, the data subject brought an action seeking access under Article 15(1) and (3) GDPR. Specifically, the data subject requested information concerning the contribution history of the insurance contract, including the dates and amounts of old and new premiums, tariff changes, and tariff terminations for several years.\nThe court of first instance dismissed the claim. On appeal, the appellate court partially upheld the data subject’s request, holding that the requested information constituted personal data and therefore fell within the scope of Article 15 GDPR. The controller appealed to the Federal Court of Justice.\nThe controller argued that the requested information did not constitute personal data because premium adjustments and tariff information were determined on an abstract, tariff-based basis and were not linked to the individual data subject. It further argued that the data subject’s request constituted an abuse of rights, as it was intended to prepare a repayment claim rather than to exercise data protection rights.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe Court upheld the appeal, set aside the appellate judgment, and referred the case back for a new decision.\nThe Court confirmed that Article 15 GDPR applies irrespective of the data subject’s motivation and that a request for access cannot be refused merely because it serves purposes unrelated to data protection. It also rejected the controller’s argument that the request constituted an abuse of rights under Article 12(5) GDPR.\nHowever, the Court held that the appellate court had made a mistake in assuming that all of the requested information constituted personal data, as information qualifies as personal data only if it relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. The mere fact that information has an economic impact on a person is not sufficient to render it personal data.\nThe Court clarified that premium adjustments, tariff changes, and tariff terminations in private health insurance are generally based on abstract calculations applicable to groups of policyholders and do not, as such, allow identification of an individual data subject. Accordingly, information on the dates and amounts of premium adjustments and tariff changes does not automatically constitute personal data within the meaning of Article 4(1) GDPR.\nHowever, the Court reiterated that correspondence originating from the data subject constitutes personal data in its entirety, while correspondence from the controller only constitutes personal data insofar as it contains information relating to the data subject.\nAs the appellate court had applied an incorrect legal standard when assessing whether the requested contribution history information constituted personal data, the case was referred back for reconsideration."

        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nThe controller is a public hospital operating a video surveillance system with 26 cameras installed across its premises, including entrances, corridors, patient admission areas, outpatient examination rooms, and three operating rooms. Most indoor cameras also recorded audio. The stated purposes of the surveillance were to ensure the safety of staff, patients and property and, in operating rooms, to ensure the smooth organisation of work.\nFollowing a notification by a data subject, the State Data Protection Inspectorate (DPA) initiated an ex-officio investigation and carried out an on-site inspection. The inspection revealed that certain cameras partially covered patient examination areas and permanent employee workplaces. In operating rooms, cameras recorded areas close to operating tables and transmitted live video and audio to a workstation, although the controller could not clearly identify who had access to the live feed or whether recordings were stored.\nThe controller relied on legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR as the legal basis and had conducted a data protection impact assessment and a balancing test. It argued that data subjects were informed by signing hospital admission documents and that access to video and audio data was restricted. During the inspection, it was also found that video recordings were stored longer than the defined retention periods.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe DPA found that video surveillance in general areas of the hospital, such as entrances, corridors, and foyers, could in principle be based on the controller’s legitimate interest in ensuring safety, provided that camera views were appropriately limited. However, video surveillance in examination rooms, admission and emergency examination rooms, and geriatric care units was unlawful insofar as camera views covered patient examination areas or permanent employee workplaces, as this failed the balancing of interests required under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.\nThe authority further held that video surveillance in operating rooms was unlawful. The controller failed to demonstrate that such surveillance was necessary to achieve the stated purpose of organising work efficiently, as less intrusive alternatives were available. Moreover, the rights and reasonable expectations of data subjects prevailed, given the particularly sensitive nature of operating rooms, where patients may be undressed and undergo invasive procedures. As a result, the processing did not meet the necessity or balancing requirements under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.\nAdditionally, the authority found that the controller unlawfully processed special categories of personal data, including health data, as it failed to demonstrate the applicability of any exception under Article 9(2) GDPR. The same deficiencies applied to the audio recording carried out alongside video surveillance.\nAccordingly, the authority concluded that the controller infringed Articles 5(1)(a), 6(1), 9(2), and related GDPR provisions and required the controller to bring its video and audio surveillance practices into compliance with data protection law."

On 8 April 2024, the data subject initiated legal proceedings against the controller before the district court. They argued that the  controller violated Article 15(1)(c) GDPR because the controller did not give a full list of recipients of their personal data. The data subjects also wants access to who they share and will share personal data with in the future, especially recipients in third countries and international organisations. \nSecond, the data subject argued that the controller must, under Article 15(1)(g) GDPR, reveal the source of the data. The data subject also claims the controller violated Article 12(1) until 12(4) GDPR. \nThe controller argued that they have no obligation to share the identity of third parties because this is confidential business information. Therefore, the controller feels that they can partially restrict the data subject’s right of access based on Article 23 GDPR and Article 41(1)(e) of the Dutch GDPR Implementation Act (Uitvoeringswet Algemene verordening gegevensbescherming – UAVG)  The controller reacted to the second point and claims that all personal data is taken from one public source (de Kamer van Koophandel).\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nFirst, the court assessed if the controller could rely on Article 41(1)(e) UAVG and Article 23 GDPR to deny an access request.\nThe  court did not find that a list of clients could damage the controller’s financial interests based on Article 41(1)(e) UAVG. The court found that the controller did not demonstrate why their customer base is a business secret. The controller did not explain how the size of the customer base and the identity of the third parties requested by the data subject negatively influenced its financial interests. Overall, the protection of business secrets is not a fundamental right and the rights of the data subject have priority over the rights of the controller. \nFurthermore, the controller does not have an obligation to share what parties they will share personal data with in the future. The controller is only obligated to share what information they shared personal data with up until the access request.\nThe court evaluated Article 15(1(g) GDPR and decided that the controller also gave enough evidence that the Kamer van Koophandel was their only source. \nThird, the court found that the court rejected the data subject’s claim that the controller violated Article 12(1) until 12(4) GDPR because the data subject gave no arguments. \nThus, the court largely rejected the claims made by the controller. The court ordered the controller to give a complete list of third parties with which they shared the data subject’s personal data. The regional court imposed a penalty to the controller of 100,00 a day with a maximum of 2.000 euros. The controller must pay the data subject 370,00 euros for procedural costs"

However, in its decision, the HDPA identified the Fire Department Headquarters as the controller. The data subject alleged that sensitive health data relating to her medical condition, sick leave, including even the medications recommended by her doctors, and disciplinary sanctions imposed on the data subject were unlawfully disclosed and made accessible to an indeterminate number of personnel.\nSpecifically, multiple documents, were circulated as outgoing administrative documents and uploaded to an internal electronic document management system. This system was accessible to all employees, including operational staff. As a result, the data subject's health data remained accessible not only at the time of disclosure but also for an indefinite future period.\nThe data subject repeatedly contacted the controller seeking explanations regarding the processing of her personal data. Although certain entries were deleted , part of her unlawfully disclosed personal data remained present in other documents. The controller further claimed that the disclosure had occurred \"by mistake\".\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe HDPA upheld the complaint and imposed an administrative fine of €10,000 on the controller for the unlawful processing of the data subject’s personal data, in particular special categories of personal data, in violation of Articles 5 and 9 GDPR.\nFirst, the HDPA held that the controller breached the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c) GDPR, as the documents contained health data that were not strictly necessary for the administrative purposes pursued. The inclusion of such detailed medical information exceeded what was required to achieve any legitimate objective.\nSecond, the HDPA found a violation of the principle of storage limitation under Article 5(1)(e) GDPR. The data subject’s personal data remained accessible in multiple documents for an indefinite period, even after certain entries were deleted following her requests. The Authority further noted that the indefinite retention of files containing personal data, as provided for under internal legislation, is incompatible with the GDPR and must be amended accordingly.\nFinally, the HDPA determined that the controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security and confidentiality of the data, in breach of Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 GDPR. The unrestricted internal access to documents containing health data exposed the data subject to an increased risk of unauthorized access.\nThe Authority emphasized that the controller’s claim that the disclosure occurred “by mistake” did not absolve it of responsibility, as compliance with the principles of Article 5 GDPR is mandatory regardless of intent. It further noted that the infringement had a systemic character, affecting not only the complainant but potentially all employees under the supervision of the Fire Service Headquarters."

In 2024, ILIAD's turnover was around €10 billion for a net profit of €367 million.\nIn September 2024, an attacker managed to infiltrate the controller's information system and accessed personal data relating to 24 million subscriber contracts, including IBAN details, which the controller became aware in October 2024. The controller notified the DPA and informed the data subjects via email. \nFollowing a large number of complaints (more than 2,500) from individuals affected by this data breach, the DPA carried out an investigation to check the controller’s compliance with the GDPR and the French Data Protection Act.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe DPA’s investigation revealed breaches of several obligations under the GDPR.\n\nFailure to adhere to the principle of storage limitation (Article 5(1)(e) GDPR)[edit | edit source]\nThe DPA found that, at the time of the investigation, the controller had not implemented measures to separate the data of former subscribers, retain only what was required for accounting purposes, and delete the rest once it was no longer needed. \nUnder Article 5(1)(e) GDPR, personal data shall be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed. \nThe DPA reminded the controller that it must review its retained data periodically and ensure that the data is deleted at the end of its retention period. Based on the investigation and the controller’s own statements, the DPA concluded that the controller had kept millions of subscriber data without justification for an excessive period of time. \nDuring the proceedings, the controller began sorting the data in order to retain for ten years only the data necessary to comply with its accounting obligations and deleted some of the data that had been retained for an excessive period.\nThe DPA ordered the controller to complete this data-sorting and deletion process within six months from the date of notification of the decision.\n\nFailure to ensure the security of personal data (Article 32 GDPR)[edit | edit source]\nThe DPA found that, on the day of the data breach, the controller had not implemented certain basic security measures that could have made the attack more difficult.\nIn particular, it noted that the authentication procedure for connecting to the controller’s VPNs  – used in particular for remote working by the controller's employees – was not sufficiently robust. Furthermore, the measures deployed by the controller to detect abnormal behaviour on their information systems were ineffective. \nGiven the amount and nature of the data processed, the DPA considered that the security measures deployed by the controller to ensure confidentiality were inadequate. It pointed out that, although it is impossible to eliminate all risks, these measures can reduce their probability and, when necessary, limit their severity (CJEU VB v Natsionalna agentsia za prihodite, Case C-340/21).\nThe DPA also noted that the controller had taken several measures during the proceedings to strengthen their level of security. The DPA ordered the controller to complete the implementation of these new measures within three months.\n\nFailure to notify data subjects of the data breach (Article 34 GDPR)[edit | edit source]\nThe DPA found that the controller had informed the individuals affected by the data breach through two levels of communication: an information email; and a toll-free number with an internal system for managing requests to the DPO. \nUnder Article 34(1) GDPR, where a personal data breach is likely to give rise to a high risk to the rights and freedoms of a natural person, the controller shall communicate the personal data breach to the data subject as soon as possible. Article 34(2) GDPR specifies the information that shall be included in the content of that communication. The DPA recalled that under Recital 86 GDPR, the communication should describe the nature of the personal data breach as well as recommendations for the affected individuals to mitigate potential adverse effects. \nThe DPA considered that although the majority of the essential information was contained through the two levels of communication, it remained that important elements were not mentioned. The email sent did not contain any information on the remedial measures the controller had taken, or on the likely consequences of the data breach for the individuals concerned, nor the measures they could take to protect themselves from them.\nAs a result, the DPA imposed an administrative fine of €27,000,000 for the infringements by the controller of  Article 5(1)(e), Article 32 and Article 34 GDPR, taking into account in particular its financial capacities, lack of knowledge of essential security principles, the number of people affected and the highly personal nature of the data concerned, as well as the risks posed by the breach of certain data."

In order to remind students of their vaccination obligations, the school sent an email to approximately 40 students under the age of 16 who had not complied with the vaccination requirements set by the healthcare system. The email contained a list of vaccines that the recipients had not received within the prescribed time limits.\nThe email was sent in such a way that all recipients’ email addresses were visible to each other, thus allowing all addressees to identify the other students concerned. As a result, personal data relating to health were disclosed to a broader group of data subjects.\nFollowing the incident, the controller notified the personal data breach to the DPA within 24 hours, stating that the disclosure was the result of a genuine error and that there was no intent to unlawfully share personal data. The controller further argued that no actual health data had been disclosed, as the email merely contained a list of vaccines and did not explicitly state any medical conditions.\nOne of the affected data subjects subsequently lodged a complaint with the DPA.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe DPA imposed an administrative fine of €1,000 on the controller and held that the high school unlawfully disclosed students’ personal and health data by sending an email in which all recipients’ email addresses were visible to one another.\nThe DPA held that the disclosure of recipients’ email addresses constituted unlawful processing of personal data, irrespective of the content of the email. The authority emphasised that email addresses allow the identification of data subjects and should not have been disclosed to third parties without an appropriate legal basis.\nFurthermore, the DPA rejected the controller’s argument that no health data had been processed. It found that information indicating whether a person has or has not received specific vaccinations clearly constitutes health data and therefore falls within the scope of special categories of personal data under Article 9 GDPR.\nThe authority concluded that the controller lacked a valid legal basis for both the disclosure of personal data under Article 6 GDPR and the processing of health data under Article 9 GDPR. In particular, the conditions for processing special category data were not met, and the processing failed to comply with the principle of lawfulness. \nAs a result, the DPA found infringements of Articles 5(1)(a), 6(1)(c) and (e), 9(1) and 9(2)(g) GDPR and, on top of the fine, ordered the controller to ensure future compliance with data protection requirements."

        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nThe data subject is a participant in a pension fund operated by the controller. He receives pension benefits and is concerned about the accuracy of his pension accrual, particularly in light of the upcoming transition to a new pension system. Because no rights can be derived from the Uniform Pension Overview (UPO), the data subject tried obtaining more certainty regarding the correctness of his pension.\nRelying on Article 15 GDPR, the data subject requested that the controller provide (i) a complete overview of the personal data on which his pension calculation was based, (ii) a clear explanation of how those data resulted in the pension amounts shown in the UPO, and (iii) a confirmation that the data used were correct. The requested information included, inter alia, pensionable salary, part-time percentages, years of service, and value transfers.\nThe controller refused to provide the requested information. It argued that the GDPR did not provide a legal basis for the request, that the data subject had already retired before the GDPR became applicable, and that the requested information did not qualify as personal data. The controller further submitted that the GDPR was not intended to enable verification of pension calculations or pension administration and that the relevant data were already accessible through the UPO.\nThe data subject brought proceedings before the Court, seeking an order to the controller to provide the requested information, a penalty payment, and an award of costs.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe Court dismissed the request in its entirety.\nThe Court held that the scope of the right of access under Article 15 GDPR is limited to personal data as defined in Article 4(1) GDPR. While that concept is broad and may include both objective and subjective information relating to an identifiable person, it does not extend to calculations themselves.\nThe Court found that the data subject’s request was primarily aimed at obtaining the pension calculations themselves and a comprehensive explanation of how those calculations were made. Such calculations are not personal data, as they are not information that, by their content, purpose, or effect, relate to an identifiable natural person. Accordingly, they cannot be obtained by invoking the GDPR. \nTo the extent that the request concerned underlying documents on which the calculations were based, the Court held that these could not be claimed under the GDPR either. In any event, the data subject already had access to the relevant data through the UPO.\nThe Court further held that explanations of the data and confirmations of their correctness do not constitute personal data and thus fall outside the scope of Article 15 GDPR.\nThe Court concluded that the data subject’s need for certainty regarding his pension, including in the context of the transition to the new pension system, could not be addressed through a GDPR access request. Consequently, the request was rejected."

The banks informed them that they had received legally binding requests to disclose information relating to their bank accounts and that they were obliged to comply.\nThe data subjects complained of the excessively broad scope of the discretion conferred on the domestic authorities by the national legislation, and of the lack of sufficient procedural safeguards capable of protecting them against any abuse or arbitrariness, in particular the lack of ex ante and/or ex post judicial or independent review of the contested measures, arguing that any available remedies under national law, were ineffective in practice. \nMore specific, the data subjects argued that Italian law lacked any effective ex post review of the measures. Civil remedies were merely theoretical, because there were no case-law examples of this, and unable to provide urgent protection, challenges before tax courts were only possible years later and could not invalidate tax assessments even if authorization was unlawful, and the Taxpayer’s Guarantor had no power to issue binding decisions. \nThey therefore lodged an application before the European Court of Human Rights, alleging a violation of Article 8 of the Convention. \nThe data subjects also claimed compensation for the non-pecuniary damage they had suffered and asked the Court to determine the amount it deemed to be appropriate.\n\nDomestic Legislation[edit | edit source]\nUnder Italian tax law, the Tax Authority is empowered to access taxpayers’ banking data for the purposes of tax audits and assessments. Such access is authorized through an internal administrative decision, which is considered a preparatory administrative act, is not subject to prior judicial authorization, and cannot be challenged independently before the tax courts. \nTaxpayers are generally informed only after their banking data has already been obtained. While taxpayers may challenge the resulting tax assessment before the tax courts, domestic case-law consistently holds that these tax assessments are not automatically invalid even where banking data was obtained unlawfully, unless the taxpayer can demonstrate concrete harm to a constitutionally protected right. \nThe Taxpayer’s Guarantor, an independent body intended to safeguard taxpayers’ rights, may issue recommendations or invite the tax authority to reconsider its actions, but has no binding powers.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe European Court of Human Rights found that the Italian legal framework governing tax authorities’ access to taxpayers’ banking data gave rise to a violation of Article 8 ECHR. While the interference pursued a legitimate aim, namely the prevention of tax evasion and the protection of the economic well-being of the State,and was based on domestic law, the Court held that it was not in accordance with the law” within the meaning of Article 8 ECHR.\nIn particular, the Court emphasized that Italian law conferred very broad discretionary powers on the tax authorities to obtain extensive banking and financial data, without requiring prior judicial authorization or a reasoned decision. The authorization to access banking data was classified in domestic law as a purely internal, preparatory administrative act, which neither had to be justified nor could be independently challenged by the taxpayer. Moreover, taxpayers were generally informed only after their data had already been obtained and processed.\nThe Court held that the domestic framework failed to provide effective ex remedies as safeguards against abuse. Authorizations to access banking data did not need to be reasoned and could not invalidate a tax assessment even if the data were unlawfully obtained, making challenges before the tax courts ineffective, uncertain, and potentially available only years later. Although administrative guidelines required banking audits to be necessary, proportionate, and targeted, these safeguards were non-binding and lacked legal force. Moreover, civil remedies were merely theoretical, as Italy failed to demonstrate their existence and effectiveness in practice, no relevant case-law examples were provided, and such remedies were in any event incapable of offering urgent or precautionary protection. Finally, the Taxpayer’s Guarantor lacked binding powers, but rather merely supervises the activity of the tax authorities.\nThe Court found that the contested measures were not subject to effective ex post judicial or independent review and therefore rejected the Government’s objection of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies. It concluded that, although Italian law provided a general legal basis for accessing banking data, the framework failed to meet the Convention’s quality-of-law requirements, as it granted the authorities unfettered discretion and lacked sufficient procedural safeguards. Consequently, the interference could not be regarded as “in accordance with the law” under Article 8 § 2 of the Convention. \nThe data subjects also claimed that the lack of an effective judicial remedy violated their right of access to justice, Articles 6 § 1 and 13 ECHR, but the Court considered the main legal issues already addressed and did not examine these separately. \nUnder Article 46 ECHR, Italy must adopt measures to align its law and practice with the Court’s findings, as the violation of Article 8 was systemic, stemming from the domestic legal framework. The Court emphasized that the law should clearly define when and under what conditions authorities may access taxpayers’ banking data, requiring justification for such measures. Effective judicial or independent review must be available, assessing both compliance and the scope of measures, without waiting for a tax assessment notice. The framework should also consider international tax cooperation while safeguarding taxpayer rights.  \nUnder Article 41 ECHR, the Court held that the finding of a violation alone suffices to compensate the data subjects for non-pecuniary damage, dismissing the government’s objection."

        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nThe data subject has been an employee of the controller since 1 February 2015.\nIn April 2023, the controller was informed of several allegations against the data subject, claiming that the subject created a toxic work environment. To verify the claims, the controller began an internal investigation from 25 August 2023 until 11 January 2024.\nThe final investigation report contained all allegations and the personal data of witnesses and accusers. \nThe data subject claimed the investigation was biased and not objective, and that the resulting report has been used to justify disciplinary measures, rejections of part time work requests, and an attempted termination, and has been quoted in interviews with the press. \nTo understand what has been said about them and verify how truthful the investigation was and if their data was processed lawfully, the data subject requested a copy of the investigation report, if necessary with redacted personal information, based on Article 15(1) and (3) GDPR. \nThe data subject also argued that disclosure of the compliance report was not barred by the rights of the controller or third parties. They maintained that the defendant had no legitimate confidentiality interest, that economic interests were insufficient, and that the report did not qualify as a trade secret or be protected by whistleblower protections, as any third-party concerns could be addressed through redaction or anonymization. \nAlso, the data subject claimed a statutory right of access to the report as part of her personnel file based on § 83(1) BetrVG and § 26 (2) SprAuG, arguing that secret personnel files are impermissible.\nFinally, the data subject argued that immediate enforceability should be possible, as no disadvantage would result and any confidentiality interests of other individuals had already been undermined by the controller quoting the report in court proceedings.\nFollowing that, the data subject requested to either get a copy of the investigation report, or to allow them to inspect it.\nThe controller requested for both options to be denied. \nIt claimed that the data subject had no significant legitimate interest in obtaining the final report, whereas accusers and witnesses had a strong interest in confidentiality. It saw the information request as an abuse of rights, pursuing purposes unrelated to data protection. Granting broad access to internal and litigation-related documents would conflict with fundamental principles of civil procedure and the prohibition on exploratory evidence gathering.\nIn addition, the controller contended that it was legally obliged to protect the anonymity of witnesses and accusers under data protection and whistleblower protection law, with potential fines in the event of disclosure, and that despite redacting personal information, there would be enough other information to identify the parties.\nFinally, the controller argued against immediate enforceability on the ground that disclosure through enforcement would create irreversible effects, as once information was provided it could not be withdrawn.\nIn the original decision of 16 January 2025, the Labour Court Munich held that the investigation report constituted processing of the claimant’s personal data under the Article 4(1) GDPR and that the request was not an abuse of rights, as the report could contain exculpatory findings relevant to employment protection or regulatory proceedings. Whistleblower protections were found inapplicable because the investigation concerned alleged managerial misconduct rather than a statutory reportable offense. The court further held that the report did not qualify as a trade secret and was not protected by attorney–client privilege, so no exemption due to Article 15(4) GDPR in conjunction with recital 63 sentence 5 would apply.\nThe controller subsequently appealed the decision and stuck to its previous claims.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe court held that the data subject has no right under Article 15(1), (3) GDPR to receive a copy of the investigation report, but is entitled under § 26(2) SprAuG to inspect the report as part of her personnel file.\nContrary to the controller's view, the court opined that the request for a copy was not an abuse of rights and it had no right to refuse under Article 12(5)(b) GDPR. Article 15 GDPR does not require the data subject to state reasons for the request, and the rights exist irrespective of whether the motives are data-protection-related or not.\nThe court did not need to decide whether the defendant could refuse disclosure of a copy under § 29(1) BDSG or whistleblower protections, nor whether the compliance report constitutes a trade secret protected under recital 63 sentence 5 GDPR, as it held that in any event, Article 15(3) GDPR does not establish a right to receive a copy of the entire report. According to the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the term “copy” refers to the personal data contained in a document, not to the document itself, and must include all such personal data, not the entire rest of the document, such as witness statements or the investigators’ analytical assessments, comparative evaluations, and recommendations. \nThe court also stated there was no entitlement to a partially redacted copy of the report, as the data subject did not seek a version limited to their personal data, but instead aimed to review the investigators’ evaluations. This exceeded what could at most be claimed in this case under Article 15 GDPR.\nTherefore, the court held that the controller is required to grant the data subject access to her personnel file, which includes the investigation report, which the controller is responsible for anonymizing. Since a personnel file may not be kept secret, its contents cannot constitute a trade secret, and therefore no irreparable legal disadvantage arises."

        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nOn 28 September 2023, the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) received a complaint from a data subject of an energy provider (the controller). The data subject reported that they had received emails addressed to another person. These emails contained that person’s personal information, including identity details, contract information, and the existence and amount of a debt. The data subject had no connection to the individual whose data was disclosed.\nThe controller acknowledged that the incident resulted from a human error. An agent using the company’s chat system accidentally assigned the data subject’s email address to another customer’s file while handling two conversations simultaneously. The chat system allowed agents to manage multiple users at the same time. At the time of the incident, no controls were in place to prevent or detect the attribution of one customer’s information to another.\nThe data subject notified the controller of the incident on the same day as the complaint to the AEPD. The company corrected the error by unlinking the email address from the incorrect customer account on 6 November 2023. During the investigation, the controller provided documents about its procedures, training, internal manuals, and contracting structure. The company also explained the chat system and confirmed that no similar incidents had occurred.\nThe controller argued that the incident was an isolated human mistake, that it acted promptly once notified, that no harm was caused, and that the AEPD lacked evidence to treat the incident as systemic. The company also questioned procedural aspects of the case and the proportionality of the preliminary proposed €1,000,000 fine, citing corporate documents, some dated after the incident, as evidence of compliance efforts.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe AEPD found that the controller failed to implement adequate measures to ensure data protection by design and by default, as required by Article 25 GDPR. The agency concluded that handling multiple customers simultaneously in the chat system created a clear risk of data attribution errors. The controller did not have effective mechanisms to prevent, detect, or correct such errors before third-party data was disclosed.\nThe AEPD determined that the incident reflected a structural deficiency in the controller’s procedures for updating and verifying personal data, and was not merely an isolated human mistake. The agency rejected the controller’s arguments regarding lack of negligence, absence of harm, and procedural defects. It classified the infringement under Article 25 GDPR.\nConsidering the scale of the controller’s operations, the nature of the failure, and the need for a dissuasive response, the AEPD imposed a fine of €500,000. The agency also ordered the controller to implement effective technical and organisational measures to prevent similar incidents and to ensure compliance with GDPR obligations."

        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nThe Hellenic Data Protection Authority (HDPA) examined numerous complaints lodged by telephone subscribers (the data subjects) who received unsolicited marketing calls promoting products and services of ZENITH, a gas supply company acting as the controller. The calls were carried out either directly by the controller or by external call centers acting on its behalf as data processors, including One Way Private Company, Sigma & Kappa Import S.A., and Revma Plus Retail S.A.\nMany of the data subjects were registered in the opt-out registry under Article 11 of Law 3471/2006, indicating that they did not wish to receive marketing calls. Despite this, they were contacted. The processors attributed these calls to human error, manual dialing mistakes, technical or systemic failures, or the use of random digit dialing systems. In certain cases, the controller argued that calls to former customers were made for market research or customer satisfaction purposes and relied on legitimate interest as the legal basis for processing.\nThe controller claimed that it had adopted extensive compliance measures, including data processing agreements, audits of call centers, data protection impact assessments, staff training, and internal policies. Nevertheless, repeated violations were identified, particularly in relation to one processor, leading the controller to terminate its cooperation with that processor.\nThe HDPA therefore examined whether the controller and its processors complied with national law on privacy in electronic communications, as well as the relevant provisions of the GDPR.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe HDPA held that the controller violated Article 32 GDPR by failing to implement and effectively apply appropriate technical and organizational measures to supervise and control its processors. In particular, the controller failed to promptly investigate complaints, verify processors’ explanations, identify the causes of unlawful calls, and adopt timely corrective measures.\nThe HDPA further held that the controller violated Articles 5(1)(a) and 6(1) GDPR by making a call to a former customer for a customer satisfaction survey after the termination of the contractual relationship without a valid legal basis. The HDPA rejected reliance on legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, finding that the rights and reasonable expectations of the data subjects, especially their explicit opt-out, clearly prevailed. It also held that characterizing calls as “market research” or “customer satisfaction surveys” does not automatically exclude them from the scope of Article 11 of Law 3471/2006 where such calls are closely linked to promotional objectives or commercial policy.\nAs a result, the HDPA imposed an administrative fine of €10,000 on the controller for infringement of Article 32 GDPR and issued a reprimand for the infringements of Articles 5 and 6 GDPR.\nThe HDPA further held that the processors, One Way Private Company, Sigma & Kappa Import S.A., and Revma Plus Retail S.A., violated Article 32 GDPR, as the technical and organizational measures applied, particularly in relation to manual calls, were ineffective and could be bypassed. This resulted in systematic and large-scale calls to numbers registered in the Article 11 opt-out registry, which could not be attributed to isolated human error. Accordingly, the HDPA imposed administrative fines of €40,000, €10,000, and €5,000, respectively.\nFinally, the HDPA held that One Way Private Company, acting additionally as a controller, violated Articles 29, 5, 6, and 7 GDPR by engaging in unlawful processing and collecting invalid consent. The HDPA imposed a further administrative fine of €40,000, ordered the destruction of all personal data obtained without valid consent, and required the company, within six months, to implement the compliance procedures specified in the decision."

The data included her name, ID number, the name of the rehabilitation center, the duration of stay, and the reason for shortening the stay. The file was not encrypted, but the employee deleted it from the private email on the same day. \nThe  Social Insurance Institution informed the data subject about the incident, apologised, and explained the potential risks. The data subject feared that her data could be misused for financial or other purposes and took preventive steps such as blocking her bank account and requesting a new identity document. \nOn 16 November 2023, the data subject filed a lawsuit seeking PLN 4,000 (€870) in compensation for non-material harm caused by the breach under Article 82 GDPR and the Polish Civil Code. She claimed that Social Insurance Institution violated her privacy by unlawfully processing her personal data.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe Regional Court in Warsaw (Sąd Okręgowy w Warszawie) dismissed the claim in full on 7 October 2025. The court recognised that sending the Excel file breached Article 5 GDPR because the data were not securely transmitted. However, the court explained that a GDPR breach alone does not create a right to compensation. To obtain redress under Article 82 GDPR, the data subject must show that she suffered actual harm and that the harm was caused by the controller’s actions. \nThe court found that the data subject did not prove that any third party accessed her personal data. Her fear of misuse, although genuine, was not reasonable given the circumstances: the file went only to the employee’s private email and was deleted the same day. The court also found no evidence that the incident caused a deterioration of her health, as she did not submit expert medical evidence linking her hospitalisation or other health issues to the data breach. \nThe court referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruling in Case C-741/21, which clarified that a GDPR breach does not automatically create non-material damage. The court concluded that the data subject experienced only subjective anxiety and concern, which were not sufficient to award compensation. \nThe court noted that the Social Insurance Institution apologised promptly, which further mitigated any possible harm. Despite dismissing the claim, the court did not order the data subject to pay  legal costs, recognising that she sincerely believed in the legitimacy of her claim."

In January 2023, their phone stopped working. The data subject requested a duplicate SIM card and discovered that a third party had already received a duplicate SIM for their line. The third party used the SIM card to access the data subject’s bank accounts and committed financial fraud.\nThe data subject complained to the controller and later to the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD). They argued that the controller issued a duplicate SIM card without their consent and without properly verifying the identity of the requester.\nThe controller confirmed that it issued duplicate SIM cards on 17 January 2023 and 19 January 2023. The controller stated that it had identity verification procedures and that a criminal third party had deceived its staff. The controller also stated that it could not provide additional records showing how it verified the identity of the person who requested the SIM duplicate.\nThe AEPD started an administrative procedure against the controller for a possible violation of Article 6 GDPR. The controller argued that the processing was lawful because it was necessary for the performance of the contract. It also argued that the fraud was caused by a third party, that it had acted in good faith, and that the proposed fine was disproportionate.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe AEPD held that the controller unlawfully processed the data subject’s personal data. The AEPD found a violation of Article 6(1) because the controller issued a duplicate SIM card without a valid legal basis. The controller could not prove that the data subject requested the SIM card or that they consented to the processing.\nThe AEPD referred to the accountability principle in Article 5(2). The controller had to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures and had to demonstrate that these measures were effective. The controller failed to provide evidence that it verified the identity of the requester.\nThe AEPD rejected the controller’s argument that third-party fraud removed its responsibility. The authority stated that controllers must prevent foreseeable risks such as SIM-swap fraud. The controller had a high duty of care because it processed large amounts of personal data in the telecommunications sector. The AEPD considered the infringement negligent because the controller could have prevented the incident with proper identity verification measures.\nThe AEPD classified the infringement under Article 83(5). It assessed the fine based on the seriousness of the infringement, the controller’s turnover, and the need for an effective, proportionate, and dissuasive sanction. The AEPD imposed a fine of €200,000 on Telefónica."

Consequently, they cannot serve as the necessary legal basis for the intended processing, by which, therefore, the fundamental principle of lawfulness is violated.\nPursuant to paragraph 4 (a) of article 15 of Law 4624/2019, the Authority issued a warning against the activation of the ‘’Smart Policing’’ system, given that, under the existing legal framework, any operational (productive) use of the system would constitute unlawful processing of personal data and would violate the provisions of the aforementioned law."

        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nThe data subject was in a dispute with a health insurance company (the controller) about premium adjustment issues in their insurance plan, and associated missed explanation obligations. \nThe data subject repeatedly used their right to access information via Article 15 GDPR to obtain data about the contribution history of the insurance contract. The data subject's original access request sought extensive documentation (all correspondence and attachments).\nThe controller refused such frequent and extensive requests, citing Article 12(5) GDPR, which allows a controller to refuse or charge a reasonable fee for excessive or repetitive requests.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe court confirmed that only the personal data of the data subject falls within the scope of Article 15 GDPR. The mere fact that some documents like formal letters or appended documents in insurance correspondence exist does not mean the entire document collection is personal data if only parts of them relate to the data subject. \nThe court explicitly stated that an access request may be repeated and the existence of prior disclosures does not extinguish the right to access further relevant personal data, so a controller cannot claim that a prior fulfillment of a request automatically precludes subsequent valid requests under Article 15 GDPR.\nThe court further held that the broad set of documents originally requested by the data subject was too general and did not meet this requirement. Only specific documents about the data subject’s insurance relationship were treated as identifiable personal information.\nThe court granted the data subject a more narrowly tailored access right to certain personal data, which requires the controller to provide a copy of specific personal information about the data subject’s contract for the years 2017 to 2019, including the dates and amounts of old and new insurance contributions, the dates of insurance plan changes and the dates when the insurance plans were terminated."
