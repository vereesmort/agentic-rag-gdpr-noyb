Despite this request, the controller continued to send emails to the data subject, including an evaluation questionnaire.\nIn response to the erasure request, the controller informed the data subject that his data would be deleted but warned that, due to automated settings, one further questionnaire email could not be stopped. The controller later claimed that the erasure had been carried out on 18 October 2023.\nFollowing a complaint by the data subject, the DPA initiated proceedings. \nDuring the proceedings, the controller admitted that, due to an administrative error, the erasure had only been partial, as the data had not been deleted from a “purchase-related dispatch file.” Full deletion was only completed on 8 February 2024, after the DPA proceedings had already been initiated.\nThe controller argued that it currently processed the data subject’s personal data solely for the purpose of handling the enforcement of the data subject’s rights and stated that technical developments had since been implemented to prevent similar issues in the future.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe DPA partially upheld the data subject’s request.\nIt found that the controller was responsible for ensuring full compliance with the GDPR throughout the entire data processing operation. An internal administrative error did not exempt the controller from its obligations under the GDPR, including the accountability principle in Article 5(2) GDPR.\nThe DPA furthre held that the controller should have complied with the erasure request within one month, in accordance with Article 12(3) GDPR. By only fully deleting the data on 8 February 2024, the controller was found in violation of Article 17(1)(c) GDPR. Moreover, after the data subject’s objection, the controller should have ceased processing the personal data for business purposes under Article 21(3) GDPR, yet continued to send evaluation-related emails.\nHowever, since the erasure had ultimately been carried out in full, the Authority rejected the request to order deletion.\nIn addition, the Authority found that the controller failed to comply with its transparency and information obligations under Article 12(2)(3) GDPR. The controller did not clearly inform the data subject which specific personal data had been deleted and which data continued to be processed, particularly in relation to data retained for handling data subject requests.\nAs a result, the Authority reprimanded the controller for the infringement of Article 17(1)(c) GDPR and ordered it to provide the data subject with proper information on the fulfillment of the erasure request and the continued processing of any remaining personal data."

He worked as a case officer in a specialised unit dealing with serious financial misconduct, including organised crime and terrorism financing. Due to their work, employees in this unit regularly issue binding decisions, conduct on-site inspections, and may appear as witnesses in criminal proceedings, which makes them identifiable to affected persons.\nBecause several employees in this unit had been threatened in the past, the data subject’s home address had been blocked from disclosure in the population register for many years. When the blocking period expired, he applied for a renewal. The local registration authority refused the request on the ground that no individual threat against the claimant had been demonstrated. The lower administrative court dismissed the data subject’s appeal against the authority’s decision, while the Higher Administrative Court ordered the renewal after the data subject also appealed the first instance court’s decision. The registration authority appealed to the Federal Administrative Court.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe Court dismissed the appeal and confirmed that the blocking of the address had to be granted.\nThe Court held that an address may be blocked where there are objectively verifiable facts showing that disclosure could endanger a person’s life, health, personal freedom, or similarly protected interests. This requires an individualised risk assessment, but it does not require that the applicant has already been personally threatened. Risks arising from a specific professional activity may suffice, particularly where other persons performing essentially the same tasks have been subjected to threats or attacks.\nIn this case, the Court had to find a balance between the public’s right to transparency of information, and the employee’s right to privacy and protection of personal data, under the GDPR and Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. \nApplying these principles, the Court found that the claimant’s work in a unit dealing with organised crime and terrorism financing, together with documented threats against colleagues in the same unit, justified the conclusion that disclosure of his address could expose him to serious risks. Where these conditions are met, the registration authority has no discretion and must block the address for the statutory period."

The request was made in the context of a collective labour dispute and was justified by the trade union on the basis of a collective agreement and its role in protecting workers’ interests.\nThe employer refused to disclose the requested data. The court of first instance rejected the trade union’s request, finding that the disclosure of such personal data lacked a sufficient legal basis, and ordered the trade union to reimburse the employer’s procedural costs.\nThe trade union appealed, arguing that public-sector salaries are public under national law, which obliges employers to provide trade unions with data necessary for the performance of trade union activities.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe court dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgment of the court of first instance.\nFirst, the court held that the collective agreement relied upon by the trade union does not constitute a law and therefore cannot serve as a legal basis for the disclosure of personal data, as required by Article 6(2) of the Personal Data Protection Act (ZVOP-2), implementing Article 6 and 9 GDPR.\nAlthough public-sector salaries are public under national law, the court clarified that this does not entitle a trade union to obtain individual salary data within a collective labour dispute. Access to such information must be sought before the competent authority, and not before a labour court.\nThe court additionally found that the national legislation invoked is not sufficiently specific, on its own, to justify the disclosure of detailed personal salary data. In line with the principle of data minimisation under Article 5(1)(c) GDPR, the trade union would have had to demonstrate concretely why the requested data were necessary for specific trade union activities, which it failed to do. General claims about monitoring compliance with agreements and analysing wage structures were found to be insufficient.\nAccordingly, the appeal was dismissed, the first-instance judgment was upheld, and the trade union was ordered to bear the employer’s appeal costs."

The data subject concerned the use of his professional email address by a bank employee (the controller) for a private matter in 2019.\nThe DSB rejected the complaint on the basis of § 24(4) of the Austrian Data Protection Act (DSG), which provides that the right to have a complaint examined expires one year after the data subject becomes aware of the alleged infringement and, in any event, three years after the event. The data subject had acknowledged that he became aware of the alleged breach no later than April 2019, meaning the one-year subjective limitation period had elapsed.\nThe data subject appealed to the Federal Administrative Court (BVwG), but the court dismissed the appeal.\nThe data subject then appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court of Austria (VwGH), arguing that § 24(4) DSG was incompatible with Article 77 GDPR, which does not provide for any limitation period, and that national law could not restrict a directly applicable EU right.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the appeal as unfounded. It held that § 24(4) DSG is compatible with Article 77 GDPR.\nThe Court found that, in the absence of EU-level harmonization of procedural time limits, Member States retain procedural autonomy to regulate the modalities for exercising GDPR rights, including the introduction of limitation periods, provided that the principles of equivalence and effectiveness are respected. The one-year subjective limitation period under § 24(4) DSG was deemed reasonable, proportionate, and justified by considerations of legal certainty, and it does not render the exercise of the right to lodge a complaint practically impossible or excessively difficult. Accordingly, the DSB lawfully rejected the complaint as time-barred in the first place."

Timegrip argued that it was only a processor and that, following the bankruptcy, no data controller existed to instruct it. The company therefore claimed it had neither a duty nor a right to disclose the personal data without compensation from the bankruptcy estate. Following this refusal, the data subject filed a complaint with the Norwegian Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet).\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe DPA upheld the complaint and imposed a fine of NOK 250,000 (€25,000) on the controller, considering the seriousness of the breach, affecting 80 unpaid data subjects, committed intentionally, and impacting vulnerable individuals\nThe DPA held that there must always be a data controller responsible for personal data and a situation with only a data processor and no controller is not allowed under the GDPR. In this case, Timegrip was deemed to be the data controller because it retained the personal data after the bankruptcy, determined who could access it, set the storage period, and refused access requests independently. \nAs the controller, Timegrip had a legal obligation to comply with data subjects’ right of access under Article 15(1) and  Article 15(3) GDPR.

After a revision, the higher court awarded €2,000 in damages. Both parties appealed to the Federal Labor Court.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nFirst, the court opined that mere infringement of the right of access, and the abstract “loss of control” inherent in any such infringement, does not constitute compensable damage, as Article 82 GDPR requires a distinct, concrete harm causally linked to the violation.\nIt considered that negative feelings or fears may qualify as immaterial damage only if objectively justified; a purely hypothetical risk of data misuse is insufficient. Unlike a data breach, delayed or incomplete access does not itself increase misuse risk. As no concrete harm was substantiated, neither GDPR-based nor alternative national-law damage claims succeeded.\nHence, the court denied any compensation under Article 82(1) GDPR, as the data subject failed to demonstrate an immaterial damage had occurred."

It imposed an administrative fine of €5,000,000, issued an injunction requiring the controller to justify implementation of robust password policies, multi-factor authentication, effective monitoring of activity logs and attached a daily penalty of €5,000 per day for non-compliance.\nCNIL emphasized that the controller had been previously warned about the need to implement effective logging and trace analysis systems, but failed to take adequate action. This prior warning, combined with the scale and nature of the breach, led the CNIL to conclude that the organization’s failure constituted gross negligence under Article 32 of the GDPR.\nThe controller argued that its information system was highly complex and that, as a public administrative institution, imposing a fine would be disproportionate and could negatively affect its budget and operations. However, CNIL held that the controler was responsible for the processing because it acted on behalf of the State, not as the State itself, and retained financial and operational autonomy."

According to the Ombudsman, the national exception under Section 6(1)(1) of the Finnish Data Protection Act, which allows insurance companies to process health data, could only apply once an insurance contract had been concluded. On that basis, the Ombudsman ordered the controller to bring its processing into compliance with Article 9 GDPR.\nThe Helsinki Administrative Court upheld the Ombudsman’s decision, finding that the concept of “insured person” under national law did not extend to insurance applicants prior to the conclusion of a contract.\nThe controller appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe court overturned the decisions of both the Administrative Court and the Data Protection Ombudsman.\nThe Court held that the concept of “insured person” in Section 6(1)(1) of the Finnish Data Protection Act must be interpreted to include the person who is the object of voluntary personal insurance, irrespective of whether the insurance contract has already been concluded or is still being applied for. This interpretation was supported by the structure and purpose of national insurance law, which requires the assessment of risk and liability already at the application stage.\nThe Court found that processing health data during the insurance application phase is an inherent and necessary part of insurance activity and falls within the national exception permitted under Article 9(2)(g) GDPR. Interpreting the exception more narrowly would exclude a core element of insurance practice without support in the legislative history.\nAccordingly, the Court concluded that the controller’s processing of health data was not unlawful under Article 9 GDPR, annulled the supervisory authority’s order, and lifted the obligation to modify the processing practices."

It found that the controller must make know the recipients of personal data, unless it is impossible to identify them. The GDPR definition Article 4 GDPR of recipient is 'a natural person or legal person, a public authority, agency or another body'. The Ministry has named the legal persons/public authorities. The case law does not require information such as departments, names or job titles to be given. The court also found support for this argument in the decision of the RvS, the Highest General Administrative Court of the NL: ECLI:NL:RVS:2025:2316. \nLast, the personal data of the data subject was named in e-mail conversations.

The request concerned documents exchanged in proceedings before the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in Shiksaitov v. Slovak Republic (applications nos. 56751/16 and 33762/17).\nThe request covered all submissions made by the Slovak Republic to the ECtHR, all submissions made by the applicant in those proceedings, and all annexes attached to those documents.\nThe Ministry partially granted the request. It disclosed certain government submissions but anonymised parts of the documents. It refused to disclose the applicant’s complaint in full, parts describing the facts of domestic criminal proceedings, file numbers of domestic cases, information relating to the applicant’s financial claims for just satisfaction, and all annexes attached to the government’s submissions. The Ministry relied mainly on Section 11(1)(d) of the Freedom of Information Act (information relating to court decision-making) and Section 9(1) and (2) of the same Act (protection of personality, privacy, and personal data).\nThe requester appealed within the administrative procedure. He argued that the Ministry had misapplied the statutory exceptions, failed to consider partial disclosure, and did not properly explain which legal grounds applied to which parts of the withheld information. The Ministry dismissed the appeal and upheld its original decision.\nThe requester then brought an action before the Administrative Court in Bratislava, seeking annulment of the Ministry’s decisions and a remittal for new proceedings.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nThe Administrative Court in Bratislava annulled the Ministry’s decision and remitted the case for further proceedings. The court held that the Ministry had partly applied the Freedom of Information Act correctly but had committed a legal error in refusing access to the annexes.\nThe court began by stressing that the right of access to information is a fundamental constitutional right. Public authorities must interpret exceptions narrowly and must always prefer disclosure over non-disclosure. A refusal is lawful only if it is based on law, pursues a legitimate aim, and is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society.\nThe court first examined whether the requested information constituted personal data. Relying on the definition of personal data under Article 4(1) GDPR and Slovak data protection law, the court held that the applicant in the ECtHR proceedings was an identifiable natural person. The requested information therefore constituted personal data, including the applicant’s complaint, descriptions of domestic criminal proceedings, domestic case file numbers, and information about financial compensation claims.\nThe court then balanced the right of access to information against the right to privacy and personal data protection. It found that the applicant in the ECtHR case was a private individual and not a public figure. The proceedings did not concern a matter of public interest. In these circumstances, the protection of personal data prevailed. The court therefore agreed that the Ministry lawfully refused access to the applicant’s complaint, domestic file numbers, factual descriptions of criminal proceedings, and information about financial claims. The court added that the Ministry should have explained this balancing exercise more clearly in its reasoning, but the outcome itself was lawful.\nHowever, the court reached a different conclusion regarding the annexes to the government’s submissions. The Ministry had refused to disclose them in full because it was not their originator, held only photocopies, and could not assess whether disclosure was lawful. The court held that this approach violated the Freedom of Information Act.\nThe court explained that possession of copies meant that the information was available to the Ministry. Availability triggered a duty to assess disclosure. If the Ministry was not objectively able to assess whether legal grounds for restriction applied because it was not the originator of the documents, it had to forward the request, in whole or in part, to the competent authority that originated the documents, in accordance with Section 15(1) of the Freedom of Information Act. The Ministry could not lawfully refuse access solely because it lacked competence to evaluate the documents.\nThe court also found that the Ministry failed to apply the principle of partial disclosure. It did not identify the annexes individually, did not examine whether only parts required protection, and did not explain why complete non-disclosure was necessary. This amounted to a blanket refusal, which the Freedom of Information Act does not permit.\nBecause the refusal relating to the annexes was based on an incorrect legal assessment, the court annulled the Ministry’s decision and returned the case for new proceedings. The Ministry was bound by the court’s legal interpretation and had to reassess the request in line with the duty to maximise access to information."

        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nThe data subject is an employee of an entity that sponsors a second division football club (the controller). The data subject obtained tickets via his employer to attend a football match. However, the data subject’s ticket was cancelled due to him being registered as a supporter of the rival football club according to the information communicated by the controller’s ticket and security manager.   \nFollowing an inquiry from the data subject, the controller specified that it obtained the information from the police. \nThe controller argued that the football match was considered high-risk and, thus, it had to submit the ticket list to the local police in order to check that no supporters of the rival football club would be seated among the home supporters for safety reasons.  \nThe controller forwarded the data subject’s name and date of birth to the local police for verification. \nThe controller claimed that it relied on Article 6(1)(c) GDPR and Article 6(1)(e) GDPR as legal bases for the transmission of personal data. The controller invoked Article 10 §1, 4° of the Belgian Law on Safety at Football Matches of December 21, 1998.\nThe data subject filed a complaint with the DPA regarding the transfer of his personal data to the police and from the controller to his employer.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nFirstly, the DPA noted that the information provided by the controller to the data subject’s employer went beyond what was necessary for informing them of the cancellation of the ticket. Therefore, the DPA found that the controller was at risk of violating Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.\nSecondly, the DPA pointed out that the controller must designate a single legal basis prior to the processing activity. Moreover, the DPA found that the article of the Football Act invoked as a legal obligation by the controller did not require a specific processing of personal data and cannot form a legal basis under Article 6(1)(c) GDPR. \nAlternatively, regarding the potential legal basis under Article 6(1)(e) GDPR, among other aspects, the controller failed to specify the nature, scope and concrete modalities of the purposes of the security measures taken under the Football Act article invoked. \nSpecifically, the DPA considered that the controller must examine whether the transfer of the personal data to the local police was a necessary and proportionate measure to separate rival supporters in order to ensure the safety of spectators and the emergency and police services. \nThe DPA pointed out that the measures are aimed at separating groups of rival supporters rather than excluding individual supporters who are not a part of such groups but are registered as supporters of the rival team. \nTaking these arguments in consideration, the DPA found that Article 10 §1, 4° of the Football Act did not provide a sufficient legal basis in conjunction with Article 6(1)(e) GDPR. \nTherefore, the DPA issued a warning to the controller to ensure future compliance with Article 5(1)(c) GDPR (i.e. the data minimisation principle) when cancelling tickets. Furthermore, the DPA warned the controller to ensure compliance with Article 6(1) GDPR in the sense that in the future it only carried out processing of personal data in the context of security measures at football matches with a valid legal basis."

        "text": "English Summary[edit | edit source]\nFacts[edit | edit source]\nThe data subject was an employee, the controller was the employer. \nOn 14 January 2022, the data subject requested access to personal data from the controller under Article 15 GDPR. They did not respond. On 28 January 2022, the controller terminated the employment.\nOn 17 February 2022, the data subject lodged a complaint with the Data Protection Authority (DPA) under Article 77 GDPR. The data subject alleged that the controller had failed to answer the access request, had taken unauthorised photographs, and had a copy of their vaccination certificate.\nOn 24 February 2022, the employment relationship ended by a court settlement before the Labour Court. The settlement stated that all claims arising from the employment relationship and its termination, whether known or unknown and regardless of their legal basis, were settled, except for employment documents. By entering the settlement, the data subject agreed to not pursue further claims.\nAfter the settlement, the controller informed the DPA that it had not received an access request from the data subject, had not taken photographs, and had destroyed the vaccination certificate after the employee left. \nThe data subject continued to raise issues with the DPA, including access to time-tracking data and alleged inaccuracies in the controller’s provided documents. The controller later provided partially redacted time-tracking data.\nOn 26 July 2022, the DPA closed the administrative procedure, as it considered that the data subject no longer had a right of access under Article 15 GDPR because the settlement didn't allow for this claim.\nThe data subject challenged the DPA’s decision before the Administrative Court. On 10 July 2024, the court dismissed the action. The data subject appealed.\n\nHolding[edit | edit source]\nFirst, the court held that the right of access under Article 15 GDPR was, in principle, waivable. Although Article 8(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights protects the right of access, the court noted that data protection law is based on self-determination, including the possibility to consent to processing under Article 7 GDPR. From this, the court inferred that a data subject could also waive the exercise of the right of access.\nSecond, the court clarified that a waiver could not generally cover unknown future data processing. However, a waiver relating to past processing was permissible, especially after the end of an employment relationship, where the imbalance between employee and employer no longer existed.\nThird, the court held that the specific settlement covered the right of access under Article 15 GDPR. The clause settling all claims arising from the employment relationship and its termination, whether known or unknown and regardless of their legal basis, also included secondary claims linked to the employment relationship, such as access rights concerning employee data. The court considered the wording sufficiently clear and found no requirement to explicitly mention data protection rights.\nFourth, the court noted that the data subject already knew about the access request and had raised it before concluding the settlement. Any internal intention not to waive data protection rights was legally irrelevant.\nFinally, the court upheld the DPA’s decision to close the procedure. Since the data subject had waived the right of access under Article 15 GDPR for past processing through the settlement, the DPA had no obligation to continue enforcement action against the employer."

The data controller had installed the cameras (three, of which one was not functioning), positioned in two external areas of the business, without signs informing about the presence of the aforementioned cameras.

In fact, the data controller did not provide data subjects with all information relating to the essential characteristics of the processing performed.\nFurthermore, the processing was considered unlawful, as it violated Article 6 of GDPR, for lacking legal basis.
